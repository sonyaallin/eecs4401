   VE returns a distribution over the values of QueryVar, i.e., a list
   of numbers one for every value in QueryVar's domain. These numbers
   sum to one, and the i'th number is the probability that QueryVar is
   equal to its i'th value given the setting of the evidence
   variables. For example if QueryVar = A with Dom[A] = ['a', 'b',
   'c'], EvidenceVars = [B, C], and we have previously called
   B.set_evidence(1) and C.set_evidence('c'), then VE would return a
   list of three numbers. E.g. [0.5, 0.24, 0.26]. These numbers would
   mean that Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.5 Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.24
