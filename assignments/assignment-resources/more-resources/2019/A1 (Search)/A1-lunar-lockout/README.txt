NOTES ON THINGS REQUIRING CHANGES/ATTENTION:

1. Note that the # of successors in this puzzle is not so many!!  Means search is a lot faster, time constraints will be a lot different than for sokoban.
2. We had an autograder.py file for the last assignment; the autograder in here has not yet been customized for the lockout domain.
3. The description also needs some attention, might not include any details about Anytime GBFS and function definitions may not be correctly detailed as is.
3. Some test puzzles can been drawn from here, haven't tried them all yet tho: https://puzzleworld.org/PuzzleWorld/art/art02.htm
4. We should add some tests or tools that enforce, or at least accurately measure, students' use of time and memory 
5. Note for Alex: Found this while hunting around, makes me think maybe we can revisit the game when we touch on planning (HW also includes more sample problems):
