def train_HMM(train_file_name):
    """
    Estimate HMM parameters from the provided training data.

    Input: Name of the training files. Two files are provided to you:
            - file_name.txt: Each line contains a pair of word and its Part-of-Speech (POS) tag
            - fila_name.ind: The i'th line contains an integer denoting the starting index of the i'th sentence in the text-POS data above

    Output: Three pieces of HMM parameters stored in LOG PROBABILITIES :
 
            - prior:        - An array of size N_tags
                            - Each entry corresponds to the prior log probability of seeing the i'th tag in UNIVERSAL_TAGS at the beginning of a sequence
                            - i.e. prior[i] = log P(tag_i)

            - transition:   - A 2D-array of size (N_tags, N_tags)
                            - The (i,j)'th entry stores the log probablity of seeing the j'th tag given it is a transition coming from the i'th tag in UNIVERSAL_TAGS
                            - i.e. transition[i, j] = log P(tag_j|tag_i)

            - emission:     - A dictionary type containing tuples of (str, str) as keys
                            - Each key in the dictionary refers to a (TAG, WORD) pair
                            - The TAG must be an element of UNIVERSAL_TAGS, however the WORD can be anything that appears in the training data
                            - The value corresponding to the (TAG, WORD) key pair is the log probability of observing WORD given a TAG
                            - i.e. emission[(tag, word)] = log P(word|tag)
                            - If a particular (TAG, WORD) pair has never appeared in the training data, then the key (TAG, WORD) should not exist.

    Hints: 1. Think about what should be done when you encounter those unseen emission entries during deccoding.
           2. You may find Python's builtin Counter object to be particularly useful
