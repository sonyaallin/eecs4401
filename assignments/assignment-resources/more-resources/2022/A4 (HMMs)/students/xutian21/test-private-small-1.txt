American
history
should
clinch
the
case
when
Congress
is
asked
to
approve
.
Whisky
on
the
air
A
Philadelphia
distiller
is
currently
breaching
the
customary
prohibition
against
hard-liquor
advertising
on
TV
and
radio
.
Starting
with
small
stations
not
members
of
the
National
Association
of
Broadcasters
,
the
firm
apparently
is
seeking
to
break
down
the
anti-liquor
barriers
in
major-market
stations
.
Probably
the
best
answer
to
this
kind
of
entering
wedge
is
congressional
action
requiring
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
to
ban
such
advertising
through
its
licensing
power
.
The
National
Association
of
Broadcasters
code
specifically
bars
hard-liquor
commercials
.
Past
polls
of
public
opinion
show
popular
favor
for
this
policy
.
Even
the
Distilled
Spirits
Institute
has
long
had
a
specific
prohibition
.
Why
,
then
,
with
these
voluntary
barricades
and
some
state
laws
barring
liquor
ads
,
is
it
necessary
to
seek
congressional
action
?
?
Simply
because
the
subverting
action
of
firms
that
are
not
members
of
the
Distilled
Spirits
Institute
and
of
radio
and
TV
stations
that
are
not
members
of
the
NAB
tends
to
spread
.
Soon
some
members
of
the
two
industry
groups
doubtless
will
want
to
amend
their
codes
on
grounds
that
otherwise
they
will
suffer
unfairly
from
the
efforts
of
non-code
competitors
.
Although
the
false
glamour
surrounding
bourbon
or
other
whisky
commercials
is
possibly
no
more
fatuous
than
the
pseudo-sophistication
with
which
TV
soft-drinks
are
downed
or
toothpaste
applied
,
there
is
a
sad
difference
between
enticing
a
viewer
into
sipping
Oopsie-Cola
and
gulling
him
into
downing
bourbon
.
A
law
is
needed
.
New
York
:
Democrats'
choice
Registered
Democrats
in
New
York
City
this
year
have
the
opportunity
to
elect
their
party's
candidates
for
Mayor
and
other
municipal
posts
and
the
men
who
will
run
their
party
organization
.
In
the
central
contest
,
that
for
Mayor
,
they
may
have
found
some
pertinent
points
in
what
each
faction
has
said
about
the
other
.
Mayor
Robert
F.
Wagner
must
,
as
his
opponents
demand
,
assume
responsibility
for
his
performance
in
office
.
While
all
citizens
share
in
blame
for
lax
municipal
ethics
the
Wagner
regime
has
seen
serious
problems
in
the
schools
,
law
enforcement
and
fiscal
policies
.
The
Mayor
is
finding
it
awkward
to
campaign
against
his
own
record
.
State
Controller
Arthur
Levitt
,
on
the
other
hand
,
cannot
effectively
deny
that
he
has
chosen
to
be
the
candidate
of
those
party
leaders
who
as
a
rule
have
shown
livelier
interest
in
political
power
than
in
the
city's
welfare
.
