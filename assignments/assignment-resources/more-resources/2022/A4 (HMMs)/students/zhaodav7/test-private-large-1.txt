These
problems
are
not
local
to
Rhode
Island
,
but
are
recognized
as
common
to
all
states
.
Situs
of
property
.
Although
the
laws
of
the
various
states
,
in
general
,
specify
the
situs
of
property
,
i.e.
,
residence
or
domicile
of
the
owner
,
or
location
of
the
property
,
the
exceptions
regarding
boats
,
airplanes
,
mobile
homes
,
etc.
,
seem
to
add
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
proper
origination
point
for
assessment
.
Rhode
Island
law
specifies
that
all
real
estate
is
taxable
in
the
town
in
which
it
is
situated
.
It
also
provides
for
the
taxation
of
all
personal
property
,
belonging
to
inhabitants
of
the
state
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
and
the
tangible
personal
property
of
non-residents
in
this
state
.
In
defining
personal
property
,
it
specifically
mentions
``
all
ships
or
vessels
,
at
home
or
abroad
''
.
Intangible
property
is
taxable
wherever
the
owner
has
a
place
of
abode
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
.
Although
a
similar
situs
for
tangible
property
is
mentioned
in
the
statute
,
this
is
cancelled
out
by
the
provision
that
definite
kinds
of
property
``
and
all
other
tangible
property
''
situated
or
being
in
any
town
is
taxable
where
the
property
is
situated
.
This
would
seem
to
fix
the
tax
situs
of
all
movable
personal
property
at
its
location
on
December
31
.
Both
boats
and
aircraft
would
fall
within
this
category
,
as
well
as
motor
vehicles
.
The
location
of
the
latter
now
is
determined
for
tax
purposes
at
the
time
of
registration
,
and
it
is
now
accepted
practice
to
consider
a
motor
vehicle
as
being
situated
where
it
is
garaged
.
Obviously
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
where
every
vehicle
might
be
on
the
31st
day
of
December
.
In
view
of
the
acceptance
accorded
the
status
of
motor
vehicles
for
tax
purposes
,
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
provision
it
would
seem
entirely
consistent
to
apply
the
same
interpretation
to
boats
or
aircraft
.
A
recent
example
of
this
problem
is
the
flying
of
six
airplanes
,
on
December
31
,
1960
,
from
the
Newport
Airpark
in
Middletown
,
to
the
North
Central
Airport
in
Smithfield
.
This
situation
resulted
in
both
towns
claiming
the
tax
,
and
probably
justifiably
.
Middletown
bases
its
claim
on
the
general
provision
of
the
law
that
``
all
rateable
property
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
shall
be
taxed
to
the
owner
thereof
in
the
town
in
which
such
owner
shall
have
had
his
actual
place
of
abode
for
the
larger
portion
of
the
twelve
(
12
)
months
next
preceding
the
first
day
of
April
in
each
year
''
.
The
Smithfield
tax
assessor
,
in
turn
,
claims
the
tax
under
the
provision
of
law
``
and
all
other
tangible
personal
property
situated
or
being
in
any
town
,
in
or
upon
any
place
of
storage
shall
be
taxed
to
such
person
in
the
town
where
said
property
is
situated
''
.
Assessment
of
value
.
This
problem
of
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
is
a
difficult
one
to
solve
in
that
the
determination
of
fair
valuation
is
dependent
on
local
assessors
,
who
in
general
are
non-professional
and
part-time
personnel
taking
an
individualistic
approach
to
the
problem
.
This
accounts
for
the
wide
variance
in
assessment
practices
of
movable
tangible
property
in
the
various
municipalities
in
Rhode
Island
.
This
condition
will
undoubtedly
continue
until
such
time
as
a
state
uniform
system
of
evaluation
is
established
,
or
through
mutual
agreement
of
the
local
assessing
officials
for
a
method
of
standard
assessment
practice
to
be
adopted
.
The
Rhode
Island
Public
Expenditure
Council
in
its
publication
once
commented
:
``
The
most
realistic
way
of
facing
up
to
this
problem
would
be
to
have
the
State
take
over
full
responsibility
for
assessing
all
taxable
property
.
An
adequately
staffed
and
equipped
State
assessing
office
could
apply
uniform
methods
and
standards
which
would
go
far
toward
producing
equitable
assessments
on
all
properties
throughout
the
State
.
A
single
statewide
assessing
unit
would
eliminate
the
differences
and
complications
that
are
inherent
in
a
system
of
39
different
and
independent
assessing
units
''
.
The
Institute
of
Public
Administration
,
in
its
report
to
the
State
Fiscal
Study
Commission
in
1959
,
recommended
``
consolidating
and
centralizing
all
aspects
of
property
tax
administration
in
a
single
state
agency
professionally
organized
and
equipped
for
the
job
''
.
The
resulting
setup
,
it
was
declared
,
``
would
be
similar
to
that
which
is
in
successful
operation
in
a
number
of
metropolitan
counties
as
large
or
larger
than
Rhode
Island
''
.
Practices
in
Rhode
Island
.
To
determine
the
practice
and
attitude
of
municipal
governments
concerning
tangible
movable
property
,
a
questionnaire
was
sent
to
all
local
government
assessors
or
boards
of
assessors
in
Rhode
Island
.
The
replies
from
each
individual
town
are
not
given
in
detail
because
the
questions
asked
the
personal
opinion
of
the
several
assessors
and
are
not
necessarily
the
established
policy
of
the
town
in
each
case
.
There
are
legitimate
reasons
for
differences
of
opinion
among
the
assessors
as
a
whole
and
among
the
public
officials
in
each
town
.
These
opinions
of
the
assessors
are
of
significance
in
indicating
what
their
thinking
seems
to
be
at
the
present
time
.
In
reply
to
a
question
of
whether
they
now
tax
boats
,
airplanes
and
other
movable
property
excluding
automobiles
,
nineteen
said
that
they
did
and
twenty
that
they
did
not
.
The
wording
of
the
question
was
quite
general
and
may
have
been
subject
to
different
interpretations
.
One
assessor
checked
boats
only
,
another
trailers
and
tractors
,
one
mentioned
house
trailers
,
and
two
others
referred
to
trailers
without
specifying
the
type
.
In
two
cases
,
airplanes
only
were
indicated
.
It
is
difficult
to
tabulate
exactly
what
was
meant
in
each
individual
situation
,
but
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
21
towns
do
not
assess
movable
personal
property
,
and
of
the
remainder
only
certain
types
are
valued
for
tax
purposes
.
Boats
were
indicated
specifically
by
only
one
of
the
five
towns
known
to
tax
boats
.
It
would
seem
,
then
,
that
movable
property
and
equipment
is
not
taxed
as
a
whole
but
that
certain
types
are
taxed
in
towns
where
this
is
bound
to
be
expedient
for
that
particular
kind
of
personal
property
.
So
few
answered
the
question
relating
to
their
efforts
to
assess
movable
property
that
the
results
are
inconclusive
.
Only
four
towns
indicated
that
they
made
any
more
than
a
normal
effort
to
list
property
of
this
kind
.
Of
greater
interest
is
a
question
as
to
whether
movable
property
was
assessed
according
to
its
location
or
ownership
.
Fifteen
stated
that
it
was
according
to
location
,
four
by
residence
of
the
owner
,
and
nineteen
did
not
answer
.
Twenty-seven
assessors
stated
that
they
were
in
favor
of
improved
means
for
assessing
movable
personal
property
,
and
only
five
were
opposed
.
Seven
others
expressed
no
opinion
.
On
this
point
there
was
fairly
general
agreement
that
assessors
would
like
to
do
more
than
they
are
doing
now
.
It
is
not
clear
,
however
,
whether
they
are
thinking
of
all
movable
property
or
only
of
boats
,
trailers
,
aircraft
or
certain
other
types
of
personal
property
whose
assessment
would
be
advantageous
to
their
particular
towns
.
Another
question
that
was
asked
of
the
assessors
was
whether
they
favored
the
assessment
of
movable
property
at
its
location
or
at
the
residence
of
the
owner
.
Eighteen
voted
for
assessment
by
the
town
in
which
it
is
located
and
eleven
preferred
assessment
by
the
town
in
which
the
owner
resides
.
Ten
others
made
no
reply
.
Of
those
who
have
an
opinion
,
it
seems
that
assessment
by
location
is
preferred
.
There
was
one
vote
for
location
being
the
place
where
the
property
is
situated
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
twelve
months
preceding
the
assessment
date
.
To
summarize
,
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
no
one
prevailing
practice
in
Rhode
Island
with
respect
to
the
taxation
of
movable
property
,
that
assessors
would
like
to
see
an
improvement
,
and
of
those
who
have
an
opinion
,
that
assessment
by
the
town
of
location
is
preferred
on
the
basis
of
their
present
knowledge
.
The
need
for
greater
knowledge
is
evident
from
their
replies
.
Boats
as
personal
property
taxing
of
boats
.
Interest
has
been
shown
for
a
number
of
years
by
local
assessors
in
the
possibility
of
taxing
boats
.
Assessors
in
Rhode
Island
are
charged
not
only
with
placing
a
valuation
upon
real
and
personal
property
,
but
they
also
have
the
responsibility
to
raise
by
a
tax
``
a
sum
not
less
than
nor
more
than
''
a
specified
amount
as
ordered
by
a
city
council
or
financial
town
meeting
.
It
has
been
obvious
to
the
assessors
,
particularly
those
in
shore
communities
,
that
boats
comprise
the
largest
category
of
tangible
personal
property
which
they
have
been
unable
to
reach
.
Through
their
professional
organization
,
the
Rhode
Island
Tax
Officials
Association
the
question
of
taxing
boats
long
has
been
debated
and
discussed
.
No
satisfactory
solution
has
been
found
,
but
this
is
due
more
to
the
difficulties
inherent
in
the
problem
than
to
a
lack
of
interest
or
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
assessors
.
It
has
been
estimated
that
the
value
of
boats
in
Rhode
Island
waters
is
something
in
excess
of
fifty
million
dollars
,
excluding
commercial
boats
.
It
is
obvious
that
this
is
a
potential
and
lucrative
source
of
revenue
for
the
assessors
of
those
towns
where
a
substantial
amount
of
such
property
would
be
subject
to
taxation
.
It
is
known
that
at
least
five
towns
(
Barrington
,
Bristol
,
Narragansett
,
Newport
and
Westerly
)
place
some
value
on
some
boats
for
tax
purposes
.
However
,
few
are
taxed
,
and
the
owners
and
location
of
most
boats
are
unknown
to
the
assessors
on
the
date
of
assessment
of
town
valuations
.
No
one
really
knows
how
many
boats
there
actually
are
or
what
their
aggregate
value
may
be
.
Slightly
more
than
5,000
boats
were
registered
with
the
Coast
Guard
prior
to
the
recent
passage
of
the
state
boating
law
.
Only
a
few
more
than
10,000
boats
had
been
registered
with
the
Division
of
Harbors
and
Rivers
at
the
end
of
the
1960
boating
season
,
but
many
had
been
taken
out
of
the
water
early
when
the
threat
of
a
hurricane
brought
the
season
to
an
early
close
.
The
assessors'
association
,
meeting
at
Narragansett
in
September
1960
,
devoted
its
session
to
a
discussion
of
the
boat
problem
.
Local
industry's
investment
in
Rhode
Island
was
the
big
story
in
1960's
industrial
development
effort
.
Fifty-two
companies
started
or
committed
themselves
to
new
plant
construction
,
totaling
1,418,000
square
feet
and
representing
an
investment
of
$11,900,000
;
;
a
new
post-World
War
2
,
record
.
With
minor
exceptions
,
this
expansion
was
instituted
either
by
firms
based
in
Rhode
Island
or
out-of-state
manufacturers
already
operating
here
.
What
made
these
new
location
figures
particularly
impressive
was
the
fact
that
although
1960
was
a
year
of
mild
business
recession
throughout
the
nation
,
Rhode
Island
scored
marked
progress
in
new
industry
,
new
plants
,
and
new
jobs
.
Of
the
major
expansions
in
1960
,
three
were
financed
under
the
R.
I.
Industrial
Building
Authority's
100%
guaranteed
mortgage
plan
:
Collyer
Wire
,
Leesona
Corporation
,
and
American
Tube
&
Controls
.
Leading
firms
that
arranged
their
own
financing
included
Speidel
Corporation
,
Cornell-Dubilier
,
Photek
,
Inc.
Division
of
Textron
,
Narragansett
Gray
Iron
Foundry
,
W.
R.
Cobb
Company
,
and
Mays
Manufacturing
Company
.
Expansion
and
relocation
of
industry
in
Rhode
Island
is
the
direct
responsibility
of
the
Development
Council's
Industrial
Division
,
and
the
figures
quoted
above
indicate
a
successful
year's
operation
.
Industrial
Division
personnel
worked
with
54
out-of-state
and
97
Rhode
Island
concerns
during
1960
,
many
of
whom
are
still
interested
in
a
Rhode
Island
location
.
They
are
conscious
of
this
state's
new
feeling
of
optimism
and
assurance
and
are
definitely
impressed
by
the
number
of
new
plants
and
construction
projects
in
Rhode
Island
.
Aids
to
small
business
Although
much
of
the
Industrial
Division's
promotional
effort
is
devoted
to
securing
new
locations
and
expansions
by
major
industries
,
small
business
is
also
afforded
considerable
attention
.
Our
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
carries
on
a
vigorous
program
,
directly
aimed
at
solving
and
expediting
the
problems
of
manufacturers
in
the
lower
employment
categories
.
A
primary
function
is
the
operation
of
a
Government
Bid
Center
,
which
receives
bids
daily
from
the
Federal
Government's
principal
purchasing
agencies
.
Assistance
is
rendered
to
interested
Rhode
Island
businessmen
concerning
interpretation
of
bid
invitations
,
where
to
obtain
specifications
,
and
follow-ups
concerning
qualification
.
During
the
past
year
,
10,517
government
bid
invitations
were
received
and
4,427
procurement
leads
were
mailed
to
Rhode
Island
manufacturers
.
In
addition
,
the
Office's
domestic
trade
program
provided
consultant
services
to
those
seeking
information
on
establishment
of
new
businesses
;
;
how
and
where
to
apply
for
financial
assistance
;
;
details
on
marketing
;
;
information
concerning
patents
,
copyrights
and
trade
marks
,
availability
of
technical
reports
,
and
other
subjects
of
interest
to
small
business
.
The
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
is
also
active
in
the
field
of
international
trade
,
assisting
Rhode
Island
firms
in
developing
and
enlarging
markets
abroad
.
This
office
cooperates
with
the
U.
S.
Department
of
Commerce
in
giving
statewide
coverage
to
services
which
include
:
statistics
on
markets
abroad
;
;
locating
foreign
agents
,
buyers
,
distributors
,
etc.
;
;
information
on
foreign
and
domestic
import
duties
and
regulations
,
licensing
,
investments
,
and
establishing
of
branch
representatives
or
plants
abroad
,
and
documentary
requirements
concerning
export
shipments
and
arrangements
for
payment
.
During
the
year
1960
,
this
office
supplied
954
visitors
with
information
related
to
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
,
and
made
73
field
visits
.
Advertising
program
Our
media
advertising
continued
,
during
1960
,
its
previous
effective
program
that
stressed
such
specifics
as
100%
financing
,
plant
availabilities
,
and
location
advantages
.
We
also
continued
to
run
a
series
of
ads
featuring
endorsement
of
Rhode
Island
by
industrialists
who
had
recently
established
new
plants
here
.
To
reach
a
still
greater
audience
of
location-minded
manufacturers
,
our
industrial
advertising
budget
for
the
fiscal
year
was
increased
from
$32,000
to
$40,000
,
and
the
Industrial
Building
Authority's
financial
participation
was
upped
from
$17,000
to
$20,000
.
Newspaper
advertising
was
mainly
concentrated
in
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Wall
Street
Journal
(
Eastern
and
Midwestern
editions
)
which
averaged
two
prominent
ads
per
month
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
the
New
York
Herald
Tribune
and
,
for
the
west
coast
,
the
Los
Angeles
Times
and
the
Wall
Street
Journal
(
Pacific
Coast
edition
)
.
In
addition
to
the
regular
schedule
,
advertisements
were
run
for
maximum
impact
in
special
editions
of
the
New
York
Times
,
Boston
Herald
,
American
Banker
,
Electronic
News
and
,
for
local
promotion
,
the
Providence
Sunday
Journal
.
Magazine
advertising
included
Management
Methods
,
The
New
Englander
,
U.
S.
Investor
,
and
Plant
Location
.
The
direct
mail
campaign
consisted
of
3
intra-state
mailings
of
1680
letters
each
and
6
out-of-state
directed
to
electronics
,
plastics
,
pharmaceutical

.
These
totaled
6,768
pieces
of
correspondence
.
The
1960
advertising
campaign
brought
a
total
of
239
inquiries
;
;
164
from
media
and
75
from
direct

led
in
the
number
of
inquiries
,
followed
by
California
,
New

Industrial
promotion
An
important
operation
in
soliciting
industrial
locations
involves
what
we
term
``
Missionary
calls
''
by
one
of
this
Division's
industrial
promotion
specialists
.
These
consist
of
visits
,
without
previous
announcement
,
on
top
officials
of
manufacturing
concerns
located
in
highly
industrialized
areas
.
More
than
25
carefully
selected
cities
were
visited
,
including
New
York
,
Brooklyn
,
Long
Island
City
,
Newark
,
Elizabeth
,
Stamford
,
Waterbury
,
New
Haven
,
Bridgeport
,
Boston
,
Cambridge
,
Worcester
,
and
Waltham
.
Out
of
a
total
of
603
calls
,
452
contacts
were
established
with
top
executive
personnel
.
We
received
76
out-of-state
visitors
interested
in
investigating
Rhode
Island's
industrial
advantages
,
and
Industrial
Division
personnel
made
55
out-of-state
follow-up
visits
.
Industrial
conferences
During
1960
,
two
important
conferences
were
organized
by
the
Development
Council's
Industrial
Division
.
In
June
,
the
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
--
in
conjunction
with
local
trade
associations
,
chambers
of
commerce
,
and
bank
officials
--
sponsored
a
World
Trade
Conference
at
the
Sheraton-Biltmore
Hotel
.
Its
purpose
was
to
find
ways
of
offsetting
the
United
States'
declining
balance
of
trade
for
1958
and
1959
.
Approximately
100
representatives
of
business
attended
this
conclave
and
the
R.
I.
Export
Conference
Committee
later
voted
to
continue
the
activity
as
an
annual
event
.
On
October
8th
of
last
year
,
the
Industrial
Division
sponsored
the
Governor's
Conference
on
Industrial
Development
at
the
former
Henry
Barnard
School
.
A
comprehensive
program
devoted
to
the
various
phases
of
the
development
effort
attracted
143
interested
individuals
.
Morning
sessions
included
addresses
by
Ward
Miller
,
Jr.
of
the
U.
S.
Dept.
of
Commerce
.
Richard
Preston
,
executive
director
of
the
New
Hampshire
State
Planning
and
Development
Commission
,
and
Edwin
C.
Kepler
of
General
Electric
Company
.
Workshop
sessions
in
the
afternoon
featured
development
executives
from
Pennsylvania
,
Connecticut
and
Maine
,
and
rounded
out
a
rewarding
program
.
In
connection
with
this
conference
,
a
64-page
supplement
was
published
in
the
October
2nd
edition
of
The
Providence
Sunday
Journal
.
Devoted
to
the
improvement
in
business
climate
and
increase
in
industrial
construction
in
Rhode
Island
,
it
has
proved
a
valuable
mailing
piece
for
this
Division
.
More
than
2000
copies
have
been
sent
out
to
prospective
clients
.
Mailings
and
publications
Other
special
mailings
by
the
Industrial
Division
included
copies
of
speeches
delivered
at
the
Governor's
Conference
,
letters
and
brochures
to
conferees
at
Med-Chemical
Symposium
at
University
of
Rhode
Island
and
letters
and
reprints
of
industrial
advertisements
to
such
organizations
as
Society
of
Industrial
Realtors
.
1184
copies
of
the
R.
I.
Directory
Of
Manufacturers
were
distributed
:
643
in-state
and
541
out-of-state
.
The
Industrial
Division
published
,
in
1960
,
a
new
,
attractive
industrial
brochure
,
``
Rhode
Island
--
Right
For
Industry
''
,
and
prepared
copy
for
a
new
edition
of
the
Directory
Of
Manufacturers
(
to
be
printed
shortly
)
,
and
for
a
new
space
catalogue
.
Additional
promotional
activities
included
organizing
the
dedication
program
for
Operation
Turnkey
,
the
new
automated
post
office
,
and
a
conference
with
representatives
of
Brown
University
,
Providence
College
,
and
University
of
Rhode
Island
,
and
eight
electronics
concerns
regarding
the
inauguration
of
a
training
program
for
electronics
personnel
.
Planning
division
Stated
in
its
simplest
terms
,
the
main
job
of
the
Planning
Division
is
to
plan
for
the
future
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
.
The
activities
of
the
Planning
Division
are
defined
in
considerable
detail
in
the
enabling
act
of
the
Development
Council
,
which
assigns
to
the
agency
both
broad
responsibilities
and
specific
duties
in
the
field
of
planning
.
Two
years
ago
,
the
Institute
of
Public
Administration
issued
an
extremely
comprehensive
report
entitled
``
State-Local
Relations
In
Metropolitan
Rhode
Island
.
As
the
result
of
an
exhaustive
review
of
the
recommendations
contained
in
this
report
,
plus
an
analysis
of
our
own
enabling
act
,
the
Planning
Division
developed
a
number
of
basic
planning
objectives
which
caused
a
reorientation
of
its
work
program
.
These
objectives
are
stated
here
because
of
their
importance
in
understanding
the
current
activities
of
the
Planning
Division
.
(
1
)
First
priority
will
be
given
to
the
preparation
of
a
meaningful
state
guide
plan
to
serve
as
a
background
for
all
other
planning
activities
in
the
state
.
(
2
)
Recognizing
the
truth
of
the
statement
by
the
Institute
of
Public
Administration
that
``
Metropolian
Planning
(
in
Rhode
Island
)
means
,
or
should
mean
,
state
planning
''
,
the
state
guide
plan
will
take
into
account
the
metropolitan
nature
of
many
of
Rhode
Island's
problems
.
(
3
)
It
will
continue
to
be
an
objective
of
this
division
to
encourage
the
acceptance
of
planning
as
a
proper
and
continuing
responsibility
of
local
government
.
To
this
end
,
the
community
assistance
program
of
the
planning
division
will
continue
to
be
operated
as
a
staff
function
to
make
available
,
on
a
shared
cost
basis
,
technical
planning
assistance
to
those
communities
in
the
state
unable
to
maintain
their
own
planning
staff
.
(
4
)
The
planning
division
will
take
the
initiative
in
encouraging
planning
cooperation
at
all
levels
of
government
;
;
among
the
operating
departments
of
the
state
;
;
between
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
state
;
;
and
on
a
regional
basis
between
the
six
New
England
states
.
(
5
)
On
the
basis
that
all
citizens
of
the
state
are
entitled
to
benefit
equally
in
the
development
of
its
resources
,
plans
for
the
provision
of
essential
services
(
such
as
water
)
will
be
based
on
need
regardless
of
arbitrary
political
boundaries
,
within
the
framework
of
the
state
plan
.
(
6
)
The
state
development
budget
will
reflect
the
capital
needs
of
all
the
state
agencies
and
the
priority
of
the
projects
in
the
budget
will
be
based
on
the
state
plan
.
(
7
)
In
preparing
the
state
guide
plan
,
particular
attention
will
be
given
means
of
strengthening
the
economy
of
the
state
through
the
development
of
industry
and
recreation
.
Functionally
the
planning
division
carries
out
four
activities
:
long-range
state
planning
,
current
state
planning
,
local
planning
assistance
;
;
and
the
preparation
of
the
state
development
budget
.
Long-range
state
planning
The
planning
division
has
embarked
on
the
most
complete
and
comprehensive
state
planning
program
in
the
nation
.
The
long-range
aspects
of
this
program
are
divided
into
four
distinct
phases
:
basic
mapping
,
inventory
,
analysis
and
plan
and
policy
formation
.
The
work
program
,
as
it
was
originally
proposed
,
was
to
take
five
years
to
complete
.
Recent
events
--
particularly
the
necessity
of
providing
planning
information
for
the
statewide
origin/destination
study
of
the
Department
of
Public
Works
--
indicate
that
this
schedule
will
have
to
be
accelerated
.
The
basic
mapping
phase
of
the
program
has
been
completed
and
the
inventory
phase
is
scheduled
for
completion
July
1
,
1961
.
Basic
mapping
Since
accurate
base
maps
are
necessary
for
any
planning
program
,
the
first
step
taken
by
the
planning
division
to
implement
the
long-range
state
plan
has
been
to
prepare
two
series
of
base
maps
--
one
at
a
scale
of
1
inch
to
a
mile
,
and
the
second
a
series
of
26
sheets
at
a
scale
of
1
inch
to
2000
feet
,
covering
the
entire
state
.
With
these
maps
completed
,
the
inventory
phase
of
the
plan
has
been
started
.
Inventory
With
the
aid
of
matching
federal
funds
available
under
Section
701
of
the
Housing
Act
of
1954
as
amended
,
the
planning
division
began
a
one
year
program
July
1
,
1960
to
complete
the
inventory
phase
of
the
state
planning
program
.
This
phase
consists
of
four
items
:
urban
land
use
,
rural
land
use
,
physical
features
and
public
utility
service
areas
.
Since
the
validity
of
all
subsequent
planning
depends
on
the
accuracy
of
the
basic
inventory
information
,
great
care
is
being
taken
that
the
inventory
is
as
complete
as
possible
.
The
urban
land
use
study
carried
out
by
the
planning
division
staff
has
consisted
of
identifying
and
mapping
all
urban
land
uses
which
are
of
significance
to
statewide
planning
.
The
rural
land
use
study
is
being
carried
out
under
contract
by
the
University
of
Rhode
Island
and
identifies
all
agricultural
land
uses
in
the
state
by
type
of
use
.
The
mapping
of
important
physical
features
such
as
slopes
and
types
of
soil
and
the
collection
of
all
available
information
pertaining
to
public
utility
service
areas
are
being
conducted
as
staff
projects
and
,
like
the
other
two
inventory
projects
,
are
scheduled
for
completion
July
1
,
1961
.
Analysis
The
collection
of
information
is
meaningless
unless
it
is
understood
and
used
for
a
definite
purpose
.
Special
districts
in
Rhode
island
.
It
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
report
to
elaborate
in
any
great
detail
upon
special
districts
in
Rhode
Island
.
However
,
a
word
should
be
mentioned
in
regard
to
them
as
independent
units
of
government
.
There
are
forty-seven
special
district
governments
in
Rhode
Island
(
excluding
two
regional
school
districts
,
four
housing
authorities
,
and
the
Kent
County
Water
Authority
)
.
These
forty-seven
special
purpose
governments
have
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
,
to
borrow
money
,
own
property
,
sue
and
be
sued
,
and
in
general
to
exercise
normal
corporate
powers
.
Unlike
cities
and
towns
,
however
,
they
do
not
have
to
submit
any
financial
statements
to
the
state
Bureau
of
Audits
.
It
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
state
government
has
little
or
no
fiscal
control
over
these
units
of
government
.
In
addition
to
the
collection
of
service
charges
,
the
special
districts
levy
annual
property
taxes
of
approximately
$450,000
.
Fiscal
years
in
other
states
comparative
data
.
A
review
of
practices
in
other
states
regarding
fiscal
uniformity
is
pertinent
to
this
report
.
Included
in
the
findings
are
:
1
.
Forty-six
states
,
including
Rhode
Island
,
end
their
fiscal
year
on
June
30
.
The
other
four
states
end
on
varying
dates
:
Alabama
(
Sept.
30
)
,
New
York
(
March
31
)
,
Pennsylvania
(
May
31
)
,
and
Texas
(
August
31
)
.
2
.
In
sixteen
states
,
the
fiscal
year
ending
of
the
cities
(
June
30
)
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
state
:
Alaska
,
Arizona
,
California
,
Delaware
,
Massachusetts
,
Montana
,
Nevada
,
New
Mexico
,
North
Carolina
,
North
Dakota
,
Oklahoma
,
Oregon
,
Vermont
,
West
Virginia
,
Wyoming
,
and
Hawaii
)
.
3
.
In
eleven
states
,
the
fiscal
year
of
the
cities
ends
on
December
31
,
while
the
state
fiscal
year
ends
on
June
30
(
Arkansas
,
Colorado
,
Indiana
,
Kansas
,
New
Hampshire
,
New
Jersey
,
Ohio
,
South
Dakota
,
Utah
,
Washington
,
and
Wisconsin
)
.
4
.
In
eight
states
whose
fiscal
years
close
on
June
30
,
a
majority
of
their
cities
close
their
fiscal
year
on
December
31
:
:
(
Georgia
,
Iowa
,
Kentucky
,
Maine
,
Maryland
,
Minnesota
,
Virginia
,
and
South
Carolina
)
.
5
.
One
state
,
Alabama
,
closes
its
fiscal
year
on
September
30
,
and
all
cities
in
the
state
,
with
one
exception
,
also
close
fiscal
years
on
September
30
.
6
.
Mississippi
closes
its
fiscal
year
on
June
30
,
while
all
of
its
cities
close
their
fiscal
years
on
September
30
.
7
.
Pennsylvania
closes
its
fiscal
year
on
May
31
.
All
of
its
cities
close
their
fiscal
years
on
December
31
.
The
remaining
twelve
states
have
varying
fiscal
years
for
the
state
,
city
and
local
governments
.
However
,
only
Illinois
,
Oregon
,
Louisiana
and
Rhode
Island
have
a
situation
in
which
the
sundry
units
of
government
vary
widely
in
relation
to
fiscal
uniformity
.
Fiscal
uniformity
:
advantages
and
disadvantages
advantages
.
An
excellent
summary
of
advantages
concerning
the
uniform
fiscal
year
and
coordinated
fiscal
calendars
was
contained
in
a
paper
presented
by
a
public
finance
authority
recently
.
He
listed
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
:
1
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
requires
compliance
with
common
sense
administration
of
local
finances
:
adoption
of
the
budget
,
or
financial
plan
,
in
advance
of
spending
.
2
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
ensures
conformance
with
another
common
sense
rule
,
that
of
having
cash
in
the
bank
before
checks
are
drawn
.
It
enables
towns
to
make
more
economical
purchases
and
to
take
advantage
of
cash
discounts
.
3
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
promotes
more
careful
budgeting
and
strengthens
control
over
expenditures
.
By
fixing
the
tax
rate
in
advance
of
spending
,
upper
limits
are
set
on
expenditures
.
4
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
brings
the
town's
fiscal
year
into
line
with
that
of
the
schools
,
which
expend
the
largest
share
of
local
disbursements
.
This
greatly
simplifies
the
town's
bookkeeping
and
financial
reporting
.
5
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
eliminates
interest
charges
on
money
borrowed
in
the
form
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Furthermore
,
tax
collections
not
immediately
needed
for
current
expenditures
may
be
invested
in
short-term
treasury
notes
,
augmenting
the
town's
miscellaneous
revenues
and
reducing
the
tax
levy
.
6
.
The
uniform
fiscal
year
facilitates
inter-town
comparison
of
revenues
and
expenditures
.
When
towns
have
the
same
fiscal
year
it
is
relatively
easy
to
make
meaningful
comparisons
;
;
and
as
the
cost
of
local
government
increases
,
the
demand
for
such
comparison
also
increases
.
Towns
having
different
fiscal
years
are
difficult
to
compare
.
Of
all
advantages
,
probably
none
is
more
important
than
the
elimination
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Borrowing
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at
all
times
.
It
may
be
by
bank
loans
,
sale
of
notes
or
warrants
,
or
by
the
somewhat
casual
method
of
issuance
and
registration
of
warrants
.
In
any
event
it
is
a
form
of
borrowing
which
could
be
and
should
be
rendered
unnecessary
.
Its
elimination
would
result
in
the
saving
of
interest
costs
,
heavy
when
short-term
money
rates
are
high
,
and
in
freedom
from
dependence
on
credit
which
is
not
always
available
when
needed
most
.
This
type
of
borrowing
can
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
quarterly
installment
payment
of
taxes
is
instituted
and
the
first
payment
placed
near
the
opening
of
the
fiscal
year
.
Any
approach
toward
such
a
system
looks
toward
saving
and
security
.
It
should
be
noted
that
there
are
other
and
equally
important
reasons
for
establishing
meaningful
intergovernmental
reporting
bases
on
a
uniform
fiscal
year
.
Both
the
federal
and
state
governments
commence
their
fiscal
years
on
July
1
.
Both
units
of
government
contribute
increasingly
large
sums
of
money
to
the
several
local
governments
in
this
state
as
indicated
below
:
It
has
been
said
that
when
local
government
revenues
were
mostly
produced
locally
from
the
property
tax
,
the
lack
of
a
uniform
fiscal
year
was
no
great
handicap
;
;
but
with
the
growth
of
state
and
federal
fiscal
aid
,
the
emphasis
on
equalization
,
and
the
state-local
sharing
of
responsibility
for
certain
important
functions
,
this
is
no
longer
true
.
The
haphazard
fiscal
year
calendar
is
an
obstacle
to
the
planning
of
clear
and
efficient
state-local
revenue
and
expenditure
relationships
.
Disadvantages
.
Although
there
are
many
sound
reasons
for
adopting
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
years
in
Rhode
Island
,
there
are
also
certain
difficulties
encountered
.
These
involve
more
the
mechanics
employed
in
adjusting
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
.
One
problem
is
a
matter
of
shifting
dates
;
;
the
other
,
is
how
to
finance
the
transition
.
Little
can
be
done
about
the
changing
of
dates
.
This
is
an
inherent
part
of
adjusting
fiscal
calendars
.
It
usually
means
a
confused
and
disgruntled
tax-paying
public
for
a
period
of
time
.
But
cooperation
and
understanding
between
local
officials
and
the
citizenry
help
lessen
this
problem
.
The
other
problem
is
the
matter
of
financing
the
transition
period
in
the
several
cities
and
towns
.
This
will
be
covered
more
fully
later
.
It
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
ease
or
difficulty
with
which
a
town
or
city
can
convert
to
the
proposed
plan
is
directly
dependent
upon
the
financial
condition
of
that
town
or
city
.
Fortunately
,
there
are
no
cities
or
towns
in
the
state
,
with
one
or
two
possible
exceptions
that
are
in
too
difficult
a
position
to
finance
the
proposed
change
.
Sacrifice
will
have
to
be
made
in
some
cases
,
but
it
is
to
the
municipality's
advantage
to
finance
the
change-over
for
a
short
period
of
time
rather
than
pay
interest
on
tax
anticipation
notes
indefinitely
.
Adjusting
the
fiscal
calendars
The
advantages
of
a
uniform
fiscal
year
and
well
synchronized
fiscal
and
tax
collection
calendars
are
sufficiently
great
for
Rhode
Island
municipalities
to
exert
effort
to
secure
them
.
The
type
of
program
desired
can
be
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
adjustments
needed
.
Two
features
are
immediately
evident
.
First
,
the
present
situation
is
too
varied
to
be
systematized
by
any
single
formula
.
Second
,
the
shift
to
a
uniform
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
will
,
of
itself
,
improve
the
tax
collection
calendars
of
the
great
majority
of
cities
and
towns
.
There
are
at
least
two
problems
to
consider
:
one
is
a
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
calendar
;
;
the
other
is
how
to
finance
the
adjustments
when
necessary
.
The
latter
matter
is
considered
in
detail
in
a
later
section
.
Twelve
cities
and
towns
in
Rhode
Island
presently
indicate
some
plans
to
establish
a
uniform
and/or
coordinated
fiscal
tax
year
calendar
.
Plans
vary
from
the
``
talking
stage
''
to
establishing
special
committees
to
accomplish
this
end
.
What
is
important
here
is
that
many
of
the
cities
and
towns
recognize
the
need
for
improved
fiscal
practices
and
are
taking
the
initiative
to
obtain
them
.
An
analysis
of
the
fiscal
tax
collection
year
calendars
throughout
the
state
indicates
that
transition
may
not
be
as
painful
as
is
commonly
thought
.
However
,
it
must
be
stressed
that
much
depends
upon
the
financial
condition
of
the
individual
cities
and
towns
involved
.
The
adjustments
needed
to
establish
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
tax
collection
year
calendar
throughout
Rhode
Island
,
based
on
a
July
1
to
June
30
year
,
are
shown
below
.
No
adjustment
needed
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are
presently
on
a
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
and
have
coordinated
their
tax
collection
year
with
it
.
No
change
is
required
for
these
towns
.
These
municipalities
include
:
Barrington
,
Lincoln
,
Middletown
,
Newport
,
North
Kingstown
,
and
South
Kingstown
.
Adjustment
of
fiscal
year
.
One
town
and
one
city
,
Coventry
and
East
Providence
,
require
an
adjustment
of
their
fiscal
year
only
.
This
change
will
automatically
adjust
their
tax
collection
year
calendar
so
as
to
make
all
tax
installments
due
and
payable
in
the
fiscal
year
collectible
within
that
year
.
Adjustment
of
tax
collection
year
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are
now
on
a
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
and
will
need
only
to
adjust
their
tax
collection
year
calendar
to
establish
uniformity
.
These
cities
and
towns
include
Bristol
,
Glocester
,
Pawtucket
,
Cumberland
,
Central
Falls
,
and
Woonsocket
.
Simultaneous
adjustments
.
Two
cities
to
be
considered
,
Providence
and
Cranston
,
are
an
enigma
.
Both
have
excellent
integration
of
their
fiscal
tax
collection
year
calendars
.
However
,
neither
of
these
two
cities
is
on
the
desired
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
.
The
adjustment
to
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
period
could
be
accomplished
relatively
easily
for
them
.
In
that
both
cities
end
their
fiscal
years
on
September
30
,
they
could
levy
taxes
for
an
interim
period
of
nine
months
,
commencing
with
September
30
and
ending
with
June
30
.
These
three
installment
dates
would
be
:
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
(
Providence
)
and
November
15
,
February
16
and
May
15
(
Cranston
)
.
Both
would
start
their
new
fiscal
year
on
July
1
.
Their
tax
collection
calendar
could
then
be
:
July
25
,
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
,
(
Providence
)
;
;
and
August
15
,
November
15
,
February
17
,
and
May
15
,
(
Cranston
)
.
Under
this
plan
both
Cranston
and
Providence
would
be
on
the
uniform
fiscal
year
but
would
still
be
using
the
same
installment
periods
.
Varying
adjustments
.
The
remaining
twenty-three
towns
have
fiscal
years
which
end
prior
to
June
30
.
All
of
these
towns
will
require
adjustments
of
both
their
fiscal
and
tax
collection
years
.
Assuming
an
adjustment
to
the
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
,
the
required
adjustment
of
the
tax
collection
years
and
the
towns
involved
are
shown
in
Table
3
.
Methods
of
financing
adjustments
Aside
from
the
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
and
tax
calendars
,
there
is
the
problem
of
financing
the
adjustment
when
this
is
necessary
.
It
should
be
emphasized
strongly
that
adjustments
in
fiscal
dates
or
adoption
of
interim
budgets
do
not
necessarily
mean
financing
over
and
above
normal
governmental
requirements
.
In
many
communities
there
is
simply
no
financial
problem
;
;
it
is
only
a
matter
of
adjusting
accounting
methods
,
careful
fiscal
planning
and
management
,
or
some
like
combination
of
techniques
.
In
other
municipalities
the
difficulties
in
overcoming
the
financial
burden
have
been
sufficiently
great
to
dishearten
proponents
of
fiscal
year
changes
.
Fortunately
,
such
cases
in
Rhode
Island
are
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
.
As
shown
earlier
in
Table
1
,
the
several
cities
and
towns
use
widely
varied
fiscal
and
tax
collection
calendars
.
In
addition
,
no
two
Rhode
Island
communities
are
identical
in
relation
to
their
over-all
financial
condition
.
These
factors
practically
insure
that
no
single
financing
formula
is
feasible
;
;
each
situation
must
be
studied
and
a
plan
developed
that
takes
into
consideration
such
factors
as
the
effect
of
the
existing
and
prospective
tax
calendars
,
the
financial
condition
of
the
treasuries
,
and
the
length
of
the
transition
interval
.
Suitable
plans
range
from
those
that
are
very
easy
to
develop
to
those
that
are
difficult
to
formulate
and
require
borrowing
ranging
from
short-term
serial
notes
to
long-term
bonds
.
The
financial
problem
,
where
it
exists
,
usually
stems
from
the
adoption
of
a
budget
for
the
transitional
or
adjustment
period
.
For
those
communities
which
have
financial
difficulties
in
effecting
adjustments
,
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
any
one
of
which
alone
,
or
in
combination
with
others
,
would
minimize
if
not
even
eliminate
the
problem
.
Rhode
Island
Heritage
Week
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
The
theme
of
Rhode
Island
Heritage
Week
for
1961
will
be
``
Independence
and
Union
''
.
It
commemorates
the
185th
anniversary
of
Rhode
Island's
Independence
when
,
upon
May
4
,
1776
,
the
General
Assembly
,
by
its
action
,
established
the
first
free
republic
in
the
New
World
.
As
this
year
marks
the
centennial
of
the
beginning
of
the
Civil
War
,
this
fact
is
being
commemorated
with
several
exhibits
throughout
the
State
,
but
most
of
all
paying
tribute
to
the
first
Rhode
Island
Volunteers
who
rushed
to
the
defense
of
the
City
of
Washington
,
putting
at
the
disposal
of
President
Lincoln
the
only
fully
equipped
and
best
trained
regiment
at
this
time
.
On
April
30
,
ceremonies
commemorating
the
departure
of
these
volunteers
will
take
place
at
1:00
P.M.
at
the
Dexter
Training
Grounds
in
Providence
.
The
Independence
Day
celebration
will
be
properly
observed
with
a
big
military
and
civic
parade
from
West
Warwick
to
the
Greene
Homestead
in
Anthony
;
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
the
week
of
april
29th
to
may
7th
,
1961
,
as
Rhode
Island
Heritage
Week
,
advising
our
citizens
that
throughout
this
week
many
historic
houses
and
beautiful
gardens
will
be
open
to
visitors
as
well
as
industrial
plants
,
craft
shops
,
museums
and
libraries
and
I
earnestly
urge
all
to
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
to
see
as
many
of
these
places
as
they
can
during
this
outstanding
week
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
21st
day
of
April
,
in
the
year
of
Our
Lord
,
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
sixty-one
and
on
Independence
,
the
one
hundred
and
eighty-fifth
.
Governor
Armed
Forces
Day
Proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
The
year
1961
marks
the
fourteenth
anniversary
of
the
unification
of
our
Armed
Forces
under
the
National
Security
Act
of
1947
.
National
defense
,
like
the
continuing
search
for
peace
with
freedom
and
justice
for
all
,
is
``
everybody's
business
''
.
Our
investment
in
this
effort
,
the
greatest
in
our
Nation's
history
,
reflects
our
determination
to
ensure
the
peace
and
the
future
of
freedom
.
It
is
a
sound
investment
.
As
the
President
has
said
,
``
only
when
our
arms
are
sufficient
beyond
doubt
can
we
be
certain
that
they
will
never
be
employed
''
.
Armed
Forces
Day
is
the
annual
report
on
this
investment
,
a
public
presentation
designed
to
give
our
own
people
,
and
the
people
of
other
lands
who
stand
with
us
for
peace
with
freedom
and
justice
,
the
best
possible
opportunity
to
see
and
understand
what
we
have
and
why
we
have
it
.
It
is
the
purpose
of
Armed
Forces
Day
to
give
Americans
an
opportunity
to
honor
men
of
the
Armed
Forces
,
those
who
have
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
,
those
who
remain
to
preserve
our
security
.
Freedom
depends
upon
them
;
;
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
Saturday
,
May
20th
,
1961
,
as
Armed
Forces
Day
,
reminding
our
citizens
that
we
should
rededicate
ourselves
to
our
Nation
,
respecting
the
uniforms
as
the
guardians
of
our
precious
liberty
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
17th
day
of
May
,
in
the
year
of
Our
Lord
,
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
sixty-one
,
and
of
Independence
,
the
one
hundred
and
eighty-sixth
.
Governor
National
Maritime
Day
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
The
President
of
the
United
States
,
pursuant
to
a
Joint
Resolution
of
Congress
,
has
issued
a
proclamation
each
year
since
1933
declaring
May
22nd
to
be
National
Maritime
Day
.
This
date
in
1819
marked
the
sailing
of
the
S.
S.
``
Savannah
''
from
Savannah
,
Georgia
,
for
Liverpool
.
This
voyage
was
the
first
successful
crossing
of
the
Atlantic
under
steam
propulsion
.
The
day
is
now
appropriately
set
aside
to
honor
the
American
men
and
women
who
have
contributed
to
the
success
of
our
merchant
marine
fleet
in
peace
and
war
.
The
Merchant
Marine
is
the
``
Fourth
Arm
of
Defense
''
,
for
a
strong
and
effective
American
Merchant
Marine
is
essential
to
the
economy
and
security
of
our
Nation
.
Through
trade
and
travel
across
the
seas
the
American
Merchant
Marine
is
carrying
out
its
historic
mission
of
linking
the
United
States
of
America
with
friendly
nations
across
the
seas
;
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
Monday
,
May
22nd
,
1961
,
as
National
Maritime
Day
,
reminding
our
citizens
that
American
Merchant
ships
and
American
seamen
are
ready
at
all
times
to
serve
our
Nation
in
the
cause
of
freedom
and
justice
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
20th
day
of

,
in
the

Governor
Miss
Rhode
Island
Pageant
Week
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
The
Miss
Rhode
Island
Pageant
is
sponsored
by
the
Rhode
Island
Junior
Chamber
of
Commerce
as
a
part
of
the
nation-wide
search
for
the
typical
American
girl
--
a
Miss
America
from
Rhode
Island
.
This
is
an
official
preliminary
contest
of
the
Miss
America
Pageant
held
each
September
in
Atlantic
City
.
The
ideal
girl
--
possessed
of
talent
,
poise
,
intelligence
,
personality
and
beauty
of
face
and
figure
--
is
chosen
each
year
to
represent
Rhode
Island
.
Many
hours
are
given
free
by
the
Jaycees
to
make
this
and
all
local
pageants
outstanding
events
.
Proceeds
realized
from
these
pageants
are
used
by
the
Jaycees
to
help
support
their
various
youth
,
health
,
welfare
and
community
betterment
activities
throughout
the
state
.
Miss
Sally
May
Saabye
,
(
Miss
Rhode
Island
1960
)
says
that
within
a
short
time
--
on
June
17th
--
her
reign
will
come
to
an
end
.
She
hopes
that
all
will
support
the
contestants
from
our
own
community
by
attending
our
Pageants
and
the
State
Pageant
June
17
;
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
the
week
of
June
11th
to
17th
,
1961
,
as
Miss
Rhode
Island
Pageant

,
with
deep
appreciation
to
the
Jaycees
,
local
and
statewide
,
for
the
presentation
of
their
beautiful
Pageants
and
the
encouragement
of
all
Rhode
Island
girls
to
participate
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
11th
day
of
June
,
in
the
year
of
Our
Lord

Governor
The
State
Ballet
of
Rhode
Island
Week
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
The
ballet
originated
in
Italy
about
1450
.
At
that
time
it
was
a
series
of
sophisticated
social
dances
whose
steps
were
often
combined
with
other
steps
devised
by
the
choreographer
.
Ballet
flowered
in
Italy
during
the
next
hundred
years
,
and
about
1550
was
carried
to
France
when
the
Italian
princess
,
Catherine
De
Medicis
,
married
the
King
of
France
.
The
most
famous
ballet
of
that
time
was
called
Ballet
Comique
De
La
Reine
(
1581
)
.
Dances
alternated
with
sung
or
spoken
verses
.
Ballets
were
used
in
opera
from
its
beginning
.
They
were
placed
either
in
the
middle
of
the
acts
or
in
the
intermissions
.
The
State
Ballet
of
Rhode
Island
,
the
first
incorporated
group
,
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
extending
knowledge
of
the
art
of
ballet
in
the
Community
,
to
promote
interest
in
ballet
performances
,
to
contribute
to
the
cultural
life
of
the
State
,
and
to
provide
opportunity
for
gifted
dance
students
who
,
for
one
reason
or
another
,
are
unable
to
pursue
a
career
and
to
develop
others
for
the
professional
state
;
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
the
week
of
Monday
,
November
13
,
1961
,
as
the
State
Ballet
of
Rhode
Island
Week
,
requesting
all
Rhode
Islanders
to
give
special
attention
to
this
unusual
event
which
should
contribute
to
the
cultural
life
of
the
State
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
23d
day
of

Governor
Proclamation
Thanksgiving
Day
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
As
another
Thanksgiving
draws
near
,
let
us
take
time
out
from
the
often
hectic
pace
of
our
lives
to
try
and
recapture
the
feelings
that
filled
the
hearts
of
the
Pilgrims
on
the
first
Thanksgiving
.
The
Pilgrims
gathered
to
thank
the
Lord
for
His
benevolence
during
their
first
year
in
the
new
land
.
They
had
been
through
trying
times
,
but
their
faith
in
the
Almighty
had
given
them
the
courage
and
the
strength
to
meet
and
overcome
the
many
problems
and
difficulties
that
were
the
price
they
had
to
pay
for
freedom
.
And
as
the
Pilgrims
bowed
their
heads
in
humble
gratitude
,
they
shared
another
feeling
--
the
anticipation
of
what
the
future
held
for
them
and
their
posterity
.
They
could
not
guess
that
from
their
concepts
of
liberty
and
freedom
would
some
day
be
born
a
new
nation
that
for
years
would
be
the
symbol
of
hope
to
the
oppressed
countries
of
the
world
.
They
simply
turned
to
God
filled
with
gratitude
and
faith
.
We
who
are
living
today
may
learn
a
valuable
lesson
from
those
who
celebrated
the
first
Thanksgiving
Day
.
The
Lord
has
shown
time
and
time
again
His
love
for
us
.
We
have
only
to
compare
the
liberty
and
high
standard
of
living
we
enjoy
in
this
great
country
with
the
oppression
and
frugality
of
other
nations
to
realize
with
humble
gratitude
that
God's
Providence
has
been
with
us
since
the
very
beginning
of
our
country
.
And
yet
,
accompanying
our
gratitude
is
the
realization
that
we
are
living
in
a
crucial
time
.
With
world
peace
constantly
being
threatened
,
most
of
us
regard
the
future
skeptically
,
and
even
with
fear
.
It
is
at
this
time
that
we
should
imitate
the
Pilgrims
by
accompanying
our
prayers
of
thanks
with
the
conviction
that
we
shall
continue
to
be
in
dire
need
for
the
Lord's
protection
in
the
future
,
if
we
are
to
have
peace
;
;
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
Thursday
,
November
23rd
,
1961
,
as
Thanksgiving
Day
,
And
so
,
let
us
remember
on
this
day
not
only
to
thank
the
Almighty
Who
gave
hope
and
courage
to
the
Pilgrims
,
but
also
to
place
our
trust
in
Him
that
He
will
continue
to
protect
us
in
the
future
as
He
has
in
the
past
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
21st
day
of
November
,
in
the
year
of
Our
Lord
,
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
sixty-one

hundred

The
American
Registry
Of
Pathology
This
consists
of
25
individual
registries
,
two
of
which
were
added
during
fiscal
years
1959-1960
(
The
Registry
Of
Forensic
Pathology
and
The
Testicular
Tumor
Registry
)
.
These
registries
are
sponsored
by
18
national
medical
,
dental
,
and
veterinary
societies
and
have
as
their
mission
the
assembling
of
selected
cases
of
interest
to
military
medicine
and
of
establishing
through
the
mechanism
of
follow-up
of
living
patients
the
natural
history
of
various
diseases
of
military-medical
importance
.
The
American
Registry
Of
Pathology
operates
as
a
cooperative
enterprise
in
medical
research
and
education
between
the
Armed
Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
and
the
civilian
medical
profession
on
a
national
and
international
basis
,
under
such
conditions
as
may
be
agreed
upon
between
the
National
Research
Council
and
The
Surgeons
General
of
the
Army
,
Navy
,
and
Air
Force
.
The
staff
utilized
the
collected
material
in
these
registries
for
numerous
lectures
to
national
and
international
meetings
,
exhibits
,
and
published
studies
.
During
the
period
of
this
report
,
37,470
new
cases
were
entered
into
the
various
registries
.
These
were
selected
carefully
and
included
not
only
detailed
clinical
information
but
adequate
pathology
of
value
for
research
and
educational
purposes
.
In
this
same
period
,
six
new
fascicles
of
the
Atlas
Of
Tumor
Pathology
were
published
and
distributed
to
medical
centers
world-wide
.
There
were
54,320
copies
of
fascicles
sold
and
642
copies
distributed
free
during
this
period
.
Forty-five
new
Clinico-pathologic
Conferences
were
prepared
,
bringing
the
total
to
61
available
for
loan
distribution
.
Nine
new
teaching
Clinico-pathologic
Conference
sets
were
prepared
,
which
makes
a
total
of
70
types
of
teaching
sets
for
loan
.
During
this
period
,
7,827
teaching
sets
were
distributed
on
loan
.
The
Clinico-pathologic
Conferences
have
been
acknowledged
as
of
great
value
and
in
consequent
great
demand
by
the
small
isolated
military
hospitals
.
The
demand
for
teaching
sets
continues
unabated
since
they
provide
the
means
for
the
military
physicians
to
review
the
pathology
of
selected
disease
processes
or
organ
systems
for
review
of
basic
sciences
and
correlation
of
clinical
physiological
behavior
with
structural
changes
.

the
three
military
services
.
Its
supplement
,
The
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
supplied
similar
material
to
enlisted
medical
personnel
.
These
publications
replaced
the
U.
S.
Naval
Medical
Bulletin
,
published
continuously
from
1907
through
1959
,
as
well
as
the
Navy's
Hospital
Corps
Quarterly
and
the
Bulletin
of
the
U.
S.
Army
Medical
Department
,
published
from
1922
to
1949
.
In
addition
,
their
establishment
made
it
unnecessary
to
begin
publication
of
a
contemplated
Air
Force
medical
bulletin
.
Estimated
annual
savings
resulting
from
publication
of
the
Journal
and
Bulletin
on
a
triservice
basis
,
as
compared
with
the
cost
of
producing
separate
periodicals
for
each
service
,
were
between
$65,000
and
$70,000
.
Additionally
,
on
the
many
ships
at
sea
and
in
the
smaller
naval
stations
,
the
availability
of
the
Journal
removed
the
necessity
of
subscribing
to
several
additional
journals
of
civilian
origin
over
and
above
the
quantity
now
authorized
,
in
order
to
provide
any
reasonably
comparable
coverage
.
From
1
July
1958
to
30
June
1960
,
24
numbers
of
the
Journal
and
nine
of
the
Bulletin
were
published
.
Each
Journal
contained
articles
of
professional
and
clinical
interest
,
and
departments
devoted
to
military
medical
news
,
reviews
of
new
books
,
and
other
features
of
interest
to
officers
of
the
medical
services
.
The
Council
on
National
Defense
of
the
American
Medical
Association
contributed
a
brief
article
to
each
issue
entitled
,
``
This
Is
Your
A.M.A.
''
.
Beginning
with
the
October
1959
issue
of
the
Journal
,
the
method
of
production
of
copy
for
photo-offset
reproduction
was
changed
from
varityping
to
hot
typesetting
.
This
resulted
in
an
improved
appearance
,
but
was
followed
by
an
increase
in
printing
cost
that
necessitated
the
institution
of
major
economies
to
keep
within
the
total
of
allocated
funds
.
The
use
of
100
instead
of
140
substance
paper
plus
the
adoption
of
side
stapling
beginning
with
the
May
1960
issue
reduced
costs
sufficiently
to
allow
completion
of
the
fiscal
year
with
nearly
$4,000
in
unexpended
funds
.
Two
special
issues
were
published
,
one
for
November
1959
on
Space
Medicine
,
the
other
the
Tenth
Anniversary
issue
for
January
1960
.
The
February
1960
issue
marked
the
reinstitution
of
the
section
entitled
,
``
The
Medical
Officer
Writes
''
.
Replacing
the
discontinued
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
publication
of
which
was
suspended
with
the
November-December
1959
issue
,
a
section
called
``
Technical
Notes
''
was
inaugurated
on
a
bimonthly
basis
beginning
with
the
April
1960
issue
.
Occasional
features
were
published
on
historical
medicine
,
special
reports
,
bibliography
,
and
``
Collector's
Items
''
.
In
May
1960
,
the
Armed
Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
began
a
series
of
articles
on
the
``
Medical
Museum
''
,
and
in
June
,
the
Institute
started
contributing
a
regular
monthly
``
Case
For
Diagnosis
''
.
The
Institute
also
planned
to
furnish
a
regular
series
of
articles
,
beginning
in
the
fall
of
1960
,
on
its
more
significant
Scientific
Exhibits
.
The
Armed
Forces
Epidemiological
Board
agreed
to
submit
each
month
a
report
for
one
of
its
12
commissions
,
so
that
each
commission
will
report
once
a
year
on
some
phase
of
its
work
calculated
to
be
of
particular
interest
and
value
to
medical
officers
of
the
Armed
Forces
.
The
first
report
in
this
continuing
series
appeared
in
the
September
1960
issue
of
the
Journal
.
Another
recent
achievement
was
the
successful
development
of
a
method
for
the
complete
combustion
in
a
bomb
calorimeter
of
a
metal
in
fluorine
when
the
product
is
relatively
non-volatile
.
This
work
gave
a
heat
of
formation
of
aluminum
fluoride
which
closely
substantiates
a
value
which
had
been
determined
by
a
less
direct
method
,
and
raises
this
property
to
15
percent
above
that
accepted
a
few
years
ago
.
Similar
measurements
are
being
initiated
to
resolve
a
large
discrepancy
in
the
heat
of
formation
of
another
important
combustion
product
,
beryllium
fluoride
.
The
development
and
testing
of
new
apparatus
to
measure
other
properties
is
nearing
completion
.
In
one
of
these
,
an
exploding-wire
device
to
study
systems
thermodynamically
up
to
6,000
Af
and
100
atmospheres
pressure
,
a
major
goal
was
achieved
.
The
accuracy
of
measuring
the
total
electrical
energy
entering
an
exploding
wire
during
a
few
microseconds
was
verified
when
two
independent
types
of
comparison
with
the
heat
energy
produced
had
an
uncertainty
of
less
than
2
percent
.
This
agreement
is
considered
very
good
for
such
short
time
intervals
.
The
method
of
calibration
employs
a
fixed
resistance
element
as
a
calorimeter
.
The
element
is
inserted
in
the
discharge
circuit
in
place
of
the
exploding
wire
,
and
the
calorimetric
heating
of
the
element
is
measured
with
high
accuracy
.
This
is
used
as
a
reference
for
comparing
the
ohmic
heating
and
the
electrical
energy
obtained
from
the
measured
current
through
the
element
and
the
measured
voltage
across
the
element
.
A
high-speed
shutter
has
been
developed
in
order
to
permit
photographic
observation
of
any
portion
of
the
electrical
wire
explosion
.
The
shutter
consists
of
two
parts
:
a
fast-opening
part
and
a
fast-closing
part
.
Using
Edgerton's
method
,
the
fast-closing
action
is
obtained
from
the
blackening
of
a
window
by
exploding
a
series
of
parallel
lead
wires
.
The
fast-opening
of
the
shutter
consists
of
a
piece
of
aluminum
foil
(
approximately
Af
)
placed
directly
in
front
of
the
camera
lens
so
that
no
light
may
pass
into
the
camera
.
The
opening
action
is
obtained
when
a
capacitor
,
charged
to
high
voltage
,
is
suddenly
discharged
through
the
foil
.
During
the
discharge
the
magnetic
forces
set
up
by
the
passage
of
current
cause
the
edges
of
the
foil
to
roll
inward
toward
its
center
line
,
thus
allowing
light
to
pass
into
the
camera
.
Experiments
have
shown
that
the
shutter
is
75
percent
open
in
about
60-80
microseconds
.
The
shutter
aperture
may
be
made
larger
or
smaller
by
changing
the
foil
area
and
adjusting
the
electrical
energy
input
to
the
foil
.
Laboratory
measurements
of
interstellar
radio
spectra
.
Besides
the
well-known
hydrogen
line
at
21
cm
wavelength
,
the
spectra
of
extraterrestrial
radio
sources
may
contain
sharp
lines
characteristic
of
other
atoms
,
ions
,
and
small
molecules
.
The
detection
and
study
of
such
line
spectra
would
add
considerably
to
present
information
on
interstellar
gas
clouds
and
,
perhaps
,
planetary
atmospheres
.
Among
the
most
likely
producers
of
detectable
radio
line
spectra
are
the
light
diatomic
hydrides
OH
and
CH
;
;
somewhat
less
likely
sources
are
the
heavier
hydrides
SH
,
SiH
,
and
Aj
.
Very
small
concentrations
of
these
hydrides
should
be
detectable
;
;
in
interstellar
gas
,
concentrations
as
low
as
Af
molecules
per
Af
may
be
sufficient
,
as
compared
to
the
Af
hydrogen
atom's
Af
required
for
detection
of
the
21-cm
line
.
High
sensitivity
in
radio
telescopes
is
achieved
by
reducing
the
bandwidth
of
the
receiver
;
;
therefore
,
only
with
precise
foreknowledge
of
the
line
frequencies
is
an
astronomical
search
for
the
radio
spectra
of
these
molecules
feasible
.
To
secure
precise
measurements
of
these
frequencies
,
a
research
program
in
free
radical
microwave
spectroscopy
has
been
started
.
Since
conventional
methods
are
insensitive
at
the
low
frequencies
of
these
molecular
transitions
,
the
paramagnetic
resonance
method
is
being
used
instead
.
This
involves
the
application
of
a
strong
magnetic
field
to
the
radical
vapor
,
which
shifts
the
low-frequency
spectra
to
a
conveniently
high
microwave
range
,
where
they
may
be
measured
with
optimum
sensitivity
.
The
first
diatomic
hydride
investigated
by
the
paramagnetic
resonance
method
was
the
OH
radical
.
Results
of
this
experiment
include
the
frequencies
of
the
two
strong
spectral
lines
by
which
OH
may
be
identified
in
interstellar
gas
;
;
the
frequencies
are
1665.32
and
1667.36
Af
,
with
an
uncertainty
of
0.10
Af
.
Success
in
observing
these
spectral
lines
has
so
far
,
apparently
,
been
confined
to
the
laboratory
;
;
extraterrestrial
observations
have
yet
to
be
reported
.
Preparations
are
being
made
for
similar
experiments
on
CH
and
SH
radicals
.
Low
temperature
thermometry
.
The
Bureau
is
pursuing
an
active
program
to
provide
a
temperature
scale
and
thermometer
calibration
services
in
the
range
1.5
to
20
Af
.
The
efforts
and
accomplishments
fall
into
three
main
categories
:
absolute
thermometry
based
upon
the
velocity
of
sound
in
helium
gas
,
secondary
thermometry
involving
principally
studies
of
the
behavior
of
germanium
resistors
,
and
helium-4
vapor-pressure
measurements
(
see
p.
144
)
.
Acoustical
interferometer
.
An
acoustical
interferometer
has
been
constructed
and
used
,
with
helium
gas
as
the
thermometric
fluid
,
to
measure
temperatures
near
4.2
and
2.1
Af
.
Such
an
interferometer
provides
a
means
of
absolute
temperature
measurement
,
and
may
be
used
as
an
alternative
to
the
gas
thermometer
.
When
values
of
temperature
derived
with
this
instrument
were
compared
with
the
accepted
values
associated
with
liquid
helium-4
vapor
pressures
,
differences
of
about
10
and
7
millidegrees
respectively
were
found
.
This
result
is
preliminary
,
and
work
is
continuing
.
Resistance
thermometers
.
Carbon
resistors
and
impurity-doped
germanium
resistors
have
been
investigated
for
use
as
precision
secondary
thermometers
in
the
liquid
helium
temperature
region
.
Several
germanium
resistors
have
been
thermally
cycled
from
300
to
4.2
Af
and
their
resistances
have
been
found
to
be
reproducible
within
1/3
millidegree
when
temperatures
were
derived
from
a
vapor
pressure
thermometer
whose
tubing
is
jacketed
through
most
of
the
liquid
helium
.
Preliminary
calibrations
of
the
resistors
have
been
made
from
4.21
to
2.16
Af
at
every
0.1
Af
.
The
estimated
standard
deviations
of
the
data
for
two
of
the
resistors
were
1
millidegree
;
;
and
for
the
third
resistor
,
3.3
millidegrees
.
Vapor
pressure
method
.
The
reproducibilities
of
helium
vapor-pressure
thermometers
have
been
investigated
in
conjunction
with
a
``
constant
temperature
''
liquid
helium
bath
from
4.2
to
1.8
Af
.
Surface
temperature
gradients
have
been
found
to
exist
in
liquid
helium
baths
contained
in
15-
and
25-liter
metallic
storage
dewars
.
The
gradient
was
about
one
half
of
a
millidegree
at
4.2
Af
but
increased
to
several
millidegrees
for
bath
temperatures
slightly
greater
than
the
**yl
point
.
A
hydrostatic
head
correction
has
been
neither
necessary
nor
applicable
in
the
determination
of
vapor
pressures
or
temperatures
for
the
bulk
liquid
helium
.
However
,
the
surface
temperature
gradient
can
produce
erroneous
vapor-pressure
measurements
for
the
bulk
liquid
helium
unless
precautions
are
taken
to
isolate
the
tube
(
which
passes
through
the
surface
to
the
vapor
pressure
bulb
)
from
the
liquid
helium
surface
.
It
has
also
been
observed
,
in
helium
2
,
that
large
discrepancies
can
exist
between
surface
vapor
pressures
and
those
pressures
measured
by
a
vapor
pressure
thermometer
.
This
has
been
attributed
to
helium
film
flow
in
the
vapor
pressure
thermometer
.
In
this
case
also
the
design
of
the
thermometer
can
be
modified
to
reduce
the
helium
film
flow
.
Pressure
transducer
for
pvt
measurements
.
Precise
pressure-volume-temperature
measurements
on
corrosive
gases
are
dependent
on
a
sensitive
yet
rugged
pressure
transducer
.
A
prototype
which
fulfills
the
requirements
was
developed
and
thoroughly
tested
.
The
transducer
is
a
null-type
instrument
and
employs
a
stretched
diaphragm
,
0.001
in.
thick
and
1
in.
in
diameter
.
A
small
pressure
unbalance
displaces
the
diaphragm
and
changes
the
capacitance
between
the
diaphragm
and
an
electrically
insulated
plate
spaced
0.001
in.
apart
(
for
Af
)
.
Spherical
concave
backing
surfaces
support
the
diaphragm
when
excessive
pressures
are
applied
and
prevent
the
stresses
within
the
diaphragm
from
exceeding
the
elastic
limit
.
Over
a
temperature
range
from
25
to
200
Af
and
at
pressures
up
to
250
atm
,
an
overload
of
300
psi
,
applied
for
a
period
of
one
day
,
results
in
an
uncertainty
in
the
pressure
of
,
at
most
,
one
millimeter
of
mercury
.
Transport
properties
of
air
.
A
6-year
study
of
the
transport
properties
of
air
at
elevated
temperatures
has
been
completed
.
This
project
was
carried
out
under
sponsorship
of
the
Ballistic
Missile
Division
of
the
Air
Research
and
Development
Command
,
U.S.
Air
Force
,
and
had
as
its
goal
the
investigation
of
the
transport
by
diffusion
of
the
heat
energy
of
chemical
binding
.
A
significant
effect
discovered
during
the
study
is
the
existence
of
Prandtl
numbers
reaching
values
of
more
than
unity
in
the
nitrogen
dissociation
region
.
Another
effect
discovered
is
the
large
coefficient
of
thermal
diffusion
tending
to
separate
nitrogen
from
the
oxygen
when
temperature
differences
straddling
the
nitrogen
dissociation
region
are
present
.
The
results
of
the
study
,
based
on
collision
integrals
computed
from
the
latest
critically
evaluated
data
on
intermolecular
forces
in
air
,
will
be
reported
in
the
form
of
a
table
of
viscosity
,
thermal
conductivity
,
thermal
diffusion
,
and
diffusion
coefficients
at
temperatures
of
1,000
to
10,000
Af
and
of
logarithm
of
pressure
in
atmospheres
from
Af
to
Af
times

density
.
International
cooperative
activities
.
In
March
,
1961
,
representatives
of
the
national
laboratories
of
Australia
,
Canada
,
The
Netherlands
,
United
Kingdom
,
U.S.S.R.
,
United
States
,
and
West
Germany
,
met
at
the
NBS
to
devise
means
for
reaching
international
agreement
on
a
temperature
scale
between
10
and
90
Af
.
As
a
first
step
toward
this
goal
,
arrangements
were
worked
out
for
comparing
the
scales
now
in
use
through
circulation
of
a
group
of
standard
platinum
resistance
thermometers
for
calibration
by
each
national
laboratory
.
Such
a
group
of
thermometers
was
obtained
and
calibrated
at
the
Aj
.
These
thermometers
have
now
been
sent
to
the
United
Kingdom
for
calibration
at
the
National
Physical
Laboratory
.
Temperature
symposium
.
During
the
last
week
of
march
1961
,
Columbus
,
Ohio
was
the
site
of
the
Fourth
Symposium
on
Temperature
,
Its
Measurement
And

.
The
Symposium
,
which
was

sponsored
by
the
American
Institute
of
Physics
,
the
Instrument
Society
of
America
,
and
the
National

,
attracted
nearly
one
thousand
registrants
,
including
many
from
abroad
.
The

contributed
to
the
planning
and
success
of
the

,
interactions
of
the

,
the
Bureau
has
strengthened
its

of
the
Office
of
Naval
Research
and
the
Advanced
Research
Projects
Agency
,
a
data
center
was
established
to
gather
and
index
all
published
information
on
atomic
transition
probabilities
.
An
exhaustive
survey
was
made
of
the
literature
,
and
a
primary
reference
file
of
approximately
600
references
was
catalogued
.
Selected
bibliographies
and
tables
of
available
data
are
now
in
preparation
.
A
wall-stabilized
high-current
arc
source
was
constructed
and
used
to
study
transition
probabilities
of
atomic
hydrogen
and
oxygen
.
This
apparatus
will
also
be
used
to
measure
transition
probabilities
of
a
large
number
of
other
elements
.
A
study
of
the
hydrogen
line
profiles
indicates
that
a
measurement
of
these
profiles
can
be
used
to
calculate
a
temperature
for
the
arc
plasma
that
is
reliable
to
about
Af
percent
.
A
set
of
tables
containing
spectral
intensities
for
39,000
lines
of
70
elements
,
as
observed
in
a
copper
matrix
in
a
d-c
arc
,
was
completed
and
published
.
Studies
of
the
intensity
data
indicate
that
they
may
be
converted
to
approximate
transition
probabilities
.
These
data
are
not
of
the
precision
obtainable
by
the
methods
previously
mentioned
,
but
the
vast
number
of
approximate
values
available
will
be
useful
in
many
areas
.
Atomic
energy
levels
.
Research
continues
on
the
very
complex
spectra
of
the
rare
earth
elements
.
New
computer
and
automation
techniques
were
applied
to
these
spectra
with
considerable
success
.

difficult
to
render
the
kind
of
service
our
expanding
population
wants
and
is
entitled
to
have
.
The
causes
of
the
decline
of
the
commuter
railroads
are
many
and
complex
--
high
taxes
,
losses
of
revenue
to
Government
subsidized
highway
and
air
carriers
,
to
name
but
two
.
And
the
solutions
to
the
problems
of
the
commuter
lines
have
been
equally
varied
,
ranging
all
the
way
from
Government
ownership
to
complete
discontinuance
of
this
important
service
.
There
have
been
a
number
of
sound
plans
proposed
.
But
none
of
these
has
been
implemented
.
Instead
we
have
stood
idly
by
,
watched
our
commuter
railroad
service
decline
,
and
have
failed
to
offer
a
helping
hand
.
Though
the
number
of
people
flowing
in
and
out
of
our
metropolitan
areas
each
day
has
increased
tremendously
since
World
War
2
,
,
total
annual
rail
commutation
dropped
124
million
for
1947
to
1957
.
Nowhere
has
this
decline
been
more
painfully
evident
than
in
the
New
York
City
area
.
Here
the
New
York
Central
Railroad
,
one
of
the
Nation's
most
important
carriers
,
has
alone
lost
47.6
percent
of
its
passengers
since
1949
.
At
this
time
of
crisis
in
our
Nation's
commuter
railroads
,
a
new
threat
to
the
continued
operations
of
the
New
York
Central
has
appeared
in
the
form
of
the
Chesapeake
&
Ohio
Railroad's
proposal
for
control
of
the
Baltimore
&
Ohio
railroads
.
The
New
York
Central
has
pointed
out
that
this
control
,
if
approved
by
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
,
would
give
the
combined
C.
&
O.
-
B.
&
O.
Railroad
a
total
of
185
points
served
in
common
with
the
New
York
Central
.
Not
only
is
this
kind
of
duplication
wasteful
,
but
it
gives
the
combined
system
the
ability
to
take
freight
traffic
away
from
the
New
York
Central
and
other
railroads
serving
the
area
.
The
New
York
Central
notes
:
``
The
freight
traffic
most
susceptible
to
raiding
by
the
C.
&
O.
-
B.
&
O.
provides
the
backbone
of
Central's
revenues
.
These
revenues
make
it
possible
to
provide
essential
freight
and
passenger
service
over
the
entire
New
York
Central
system
as
well
as
the
New
York
area
commuter
and
terminal
freight
services
.
If
these
services
are
to
be
maintained
,
the
New
York
Central
must
have
the
revenues
to
make
them
possible
''
.
The
New
York
Central
today
handles
60
percent
of
all
southbound
commuter
traffic
coming
into
New
York
City
.
This
is
a
$14
million
operation
involving
3,500
employees
who
work
on
commuter
traffic
exclusively
.
A
blow
to
this
phase
of
the
Central's
operations
would
have
serious
economic
consequences
not
only
to
the
railroad
itself
,
but
to
the
40,000
people
per
day
who
are
provided
with
efficient
,
reasonably
priced
transportation
in
and
out
of
the
city
.
``
There
is
a
workable
alternative
to
this
potentially
dangerous
and
harmful
C.
&
O.
-
B.
&
O.
merger
scheme
''
--
The
Central
has
pointed
out
.
``
The
logic
of
creating
a
strong
,
balanced
,
competitive
two-system
railroad
service
in
the
East
is
so
obvious
that
B.
&
O.
was
publicly
committed
to
the
approach
outlined
here
.
Detailed
studies
of
the
plan
were
well
underway
.
Though
far
from
completion
,
these
studies
indicated
beyond
a
doubt
that
savings
would
result
which
would
be
of
unprecedented
benefit
to
the
railroads
concerned
,
their
investors
,
their
customers
,
their
users
,
and
to
the
public
at
large
.
Then
,
abandoning
the
studies
in
the
face
of
their
promising
outlook
for
all
concerned
,
B.
&
O.
entered
on-again-off-again
negotiations
with
C.
&
O.
which
resulted
in
the
present
situation
.
In
the
light
of
the
facts
at
hand
,
however
,
New
York
Central
intends
to
pursue
the
objective
of
helping
to
create
a
healthy
two-system
eastern
railroad
structure
in
the
public
interest
''
.
The
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
will
commence
its
deliberations
on
the
proposed
C.
&
O.
-
B.
&
O.
merger
on
June
18
.
Obviously
,
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
will
not
force
the
New
York
Central
to
further
curtail
its
commuter
operations
by
giving
undue
competitive
advantages
to
the
lines
that
wish
to
merge
.
However
,
there
is
a
more
profound
consideration
to
this
proposed
merger
than
profit
and
loss
.
That
is
,
will
it
serve
the
long-range
public
interest
?
?
For
the
past
40
years
Congress
has
advocated
a
carefully
planned
,
balanced
and
competitive
railway
system
.
We
must
ask
ourselves
which
of
the
two
alternatives
will
help
the
commuter
--
the
two-way
B.
&
O.
-
C.
&
O.
merger
,
or
the
three-way
New
York
Central
-
B.
&
O.
-
C.
&
O.
merger
.
Which
will
serve
not
only
the
best
interest
of
the
stockholders
,
but
the
interests
of
all
the
traveling
public
?

Mr.
Speaker
,
I
rise
today
to
pay
tribute
to
a
great
newspaper
,
the
New
York
Times
,
on
the
occasion
of
a
major
change
in
its
top
executive
command
.
Arthur
Hays
Sulzberger
has
been
a
distinguished
publisher
of
this
distinguished
newspaper
and
it
is
fitting
that
we
take
due
notice
of
his
major
contribution
to
American
journalism
on
the
occasion
of
his
retirement
.
I
am
pleased
to
note
that
Mr.
Sulzberger
will
continue
to
serve
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
New
York
Times
.
Mr.
Sulzberger's
successor
as
publisher
is
Mr.
Orvil
E.
Dryfoos
,
who
is
president
of
the
New
York
Times
Co.
,
and
who
has
been
with
the
Times
since
1942
.
Mr.
Dryfoos'
outstanding
career
as
a
journalist
guarantees
that
the
high
standards
which
have
made
the
Times
one
of
the
world's
great
newspapers
will
be
maintained
.
I
am
also
pleased
to
note
that
Mr.
John
B.
Oakes
,
a
member
of
the
Times
staff
since
1946
,
has
been
appointed
as
editorial
page
editor
.
Mr.
Oakes
succeeds
Charles
Merz
,
editor
since
1938
,
who
now
becomes
editor
emeritus
.
I
should
like
at
this
time
,
Mr.
Speaker
,
to
pay
warm
tribute
to
Arthur
Hays
Sulzberger
and
Charles
Merz
on
the
occasion
of
their
retirement
from
distinguished
careers
in
American
journalism
.
My
heartiest
congratulations
go
to
their
successors
,
Orvil
E.
Dryfoos
and
John
B.
Oakes
,
who
can
be
counted
upon
to
sustain
the
illustrious
tradition
of
the
New
York
Times
.
The
people
of
the
17th
District
of
New
York
,
and
I
as
their
Representative
in
Congress
,
take
great
pride
in
the
New

Times
as
one
of
the
great
and
authoritative
newspapers
of
the
world
.
Mr.
Stratton

Mr.
Speaker
,
in
my
latest
newsletter
to
my
constituents
I
urged
the
imposition
of
a
naval
blockade
of
Cuba
as
the
only
effective
method
of
preventing
continued
Soviet
armaments
from
coming
into
the
Western

in
violation
of
the
Monroe
Doctrine

Yesterday
,
I
had
the
privilege
of
reading
a
thoughtful
article
in
the
U.S.
News

of
May
8
which
discussed
this
type
of
action
in
more
detail
,
including
both
its
advantages
and
its
disadvantages
.
Under
leave
to
extend
my
remarks
,
I
include
the
relevant
portion
of
my
newsletter
,
together
with
the
text
of
the
article
from
the
U.S.
News

:
``
your
Congressman

Samuel
S.
Stratton
,
reports
from
Washington

May
1
,
1961
.
Cuban
S.S.R.
:
Whatever
may
have
been
the
setbacks
resulting
from
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
Cuban
rebels
to
establish
a
beachhead
on
the
Castro-held
mainland
last
week
,
there
was
at
least
one
positive
benefit
,
and
that
was
the
clear-cut
revelation
to
the
whole
world
of
the
complete
conversion
of
Cuba
into
a
Russian-dominated
military
base
.
In
fact
,
one
of
the
major
reasons
for
the
failure
of
the
ill-starred
expedition
appears
to
have
been
a
lack
of
full
information
on
the
extent
to
which
Cuba
has
been
getting
this
Russian
military
equipment
.
Somehow
,
the
pictures
and
stories
of
Soviet
T-34
tanks
on
Cuban
beaches
and
Russian
Mig
jet
fighters
strafing
rebel
troops
has
brought
home
to
all
of
us
the
stark
,
blunt
truth
of
what
it
means
to
have
a
Russian
military
base
90
miles
away
from
home
.
Russian
tanks
and
planes
in
Cuba
jeopardize
the
security
of
the
United
States
,
violate
the
Monroe
Doctrine
,
and
threaten
the
security
of
every
other
Latin
American
republic
.
Once
the
full
extent
of
this
Russian
military
penetration
of
Cuba
was
clear
,
President
Kennedy
announced
we
would
take
whatever
action
was
appropriate
to
prevent
this
,
even
if
we
had
to
go
it
alone
.
But
the
Latin
American
republics
who
have
been
rather
inclined
to
drag
their
feet
on
taking
action
against
Castro
also
reacted
swiftly
last
week
by
finally
throwing
Cuba
off
the
Inter-American
Defense
Board
.
For
years
the
United
States
had
been
trying
to
get
these
countries
to
exclude
Castro's
representative
from
secret
military
talks
.
But
it
took
the
pictures
of
the
Migs
and
the
T-34
tanks
to
do
the
job
.
There
is
a
new
atmosphere
of
urgency
in
Washington
this
week
.
You
can
see
it
,
for
example
,
in
the
extensive
efforts
President
Kennedy
has
made
to
enlist
solid
bipartisan
support
for
his
actions
toward
both
Cuba
and
Laos
;
;
efforts
,
as
I
see
it
,
which
are
being
directed
,
by
the
way
,
toward
support
for
future
actions
,
not
for
those
already
past
.
What
the
next
move
will
be
only
time
,
of
course
,
will
tell
.
Personally
,
I
think
we
ought
to
set
up
an
immediate
naval
blockade
of
Cuba
.
We
simply
can't
tolerate
further
Russian
weapons
,
including
the
possibility
of
long-range
nuclear
missiles
,
being
located
in
Cuba
.
Obviously
,
we
can't
stop
them
from
coming
in
,
however
,
just
by
talk
.
A
naval
blockade
would
be
thoroughly
in
line
with
the
Monroe
Doctrine
,
would
be
a
relatively
simple
operation
to
carry
out
,
and
would
bring
an
abrupt
end
to
Soviet
penetration
of
our
hemisphere

News
&

next
for
Cuba
:
an
arms
blockade
?
?
Look
at
Castro
now
--
cockier
than
ever
with
arms
and
agents
to
threaten
the
Americas
.
How
can
the
United
States
act
?
?
Blockade
is
one
answer
offered
by
experts
.
In
it
they
see
a
way
to
isolate
Cuba
,
stop
infiltration
,
maybe
finish
Castro
,
too
.
This
is
the
question
now
facing
President
Kennedy
:
How
to
put
a
stop
to
the
Soviet
buildup
in
Cuba
and
to
Communist
infiltration
of
this
hemisphere
?
?
On
April
25
,
the
White
House
reported
that
a
total
embargo
of
remaining
U.S.
trade
with
Cuba
was
being
considered
.
Its
aim
:
To
undermine
further
Cuba's
economy
.
Weaken
Castro
.
Another
strategy
--
bolder
and
tougher
--
was
also
attracting
notice
in
Washington
:
a
naval
and
air
blockade
to
cut
Cuba
off
from
the
world
,
destroy
Castro
.
Blockade
,
in
the
view
of
military
and
civilian
experts
,
could
restore
teeth
to
the
Monroe
Doctrine
.
It
could
halt
a
flood
of
Communist
arms
and
strategic
supplies
now
reaching
Castro
.
It
could
stop
Cuban
re-export
of
guns
and
propaganda
materials
to
South
America
.
It
would
be
the
most
severe
reprisal
,
short
of
declared
war
,
that
the
United
States
could
invoke
against
Castro
.
It
is
the
strategy
of
blockade
,
therefore
,
that
is
suddenly
at
the
center
of
attention
of
administration
officials
,
Members
of
Congress
,
officers
in
the
Pentagon
.
As
a
possible
course
of
action
,
it
also
is
the
center
of
debate
and
is
raising
many
questions
.
Among
these
questions
:
what
would
a
Cuba
blockade
take
?
?
Military
experts
say
a
tight
naval
blockade
off
Cuban
ports
and
at
the
approaches
to
Cuban
waters
would
require
two
naval
task
forces
,
each
built
around
an
aircraft
carrier
with
a
complement
of
about
100
planes
and
several
destroyers
.
The
Navy
,
on
April
25
,
announced
it
is
bringing
back
the
carrier
Shangri-La
from
the
Mediterranean
,
increasing
to
four
the
number
of
attack
carriers
in
the
vicinity
of
Cuba
.
More
than
36
other
big
Navy
ships
are
no
less
than
a
day's
sailing
time
away
.
To
round
out
the
blockading
force
,
submarines
would
be
needed
--
to
locate
,
identify
and
track
approaching
vessels
.
Land-based
radar
would
help
with
this
task
.
So
would
radar
picket
ships
.
A
squadron
of
Navy
jets
and
another
of
long-range
patrol
planes
would
add
support
to
the
carrier
task
forces
.
Three
requirements
go
with
a
blockade
:
It
must
be
proclaimed
;
;
the
blockading
force
must
be
powerful
enough
to
enforce
it
;
;
and
it
must
be
enforced
without
discrimination
.
Once
these
conditions
of
international
law
are
met
,
countries
that
try
to
run
the
blockade
do
so
at
their
own
risk
.
Blockade
runners
can
be
stopped
--
by
gunfire
,
if
necessary
--
searched
and
held
,
at
least
temporarily
.
They
could
be
sent
to
U.S.
ports
for
rulings
whether
cargo
should
be
confiscated
.
What
could
a
blockade
accomplish
?
?
Plenty
,
say
the
experts
.
In
a
broad
sense
,
it
would
reaffirm
the
Monroe
Doctrine
by
opposing
Communist
interference
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
.
It
could
,
by
avoiding
direct
intervention
,
provide
a
short-of-war
strategy
to
meet
short-of-war
infiltration
.
Primary
target
would
be
shipments
of
tanks
,
guns
,
aviation
gasoline
and
ammunition
coming
from
Russia
and
Czechoslovakia
.
Shipments
of
arms
from
Western
countries
could
similarly
be
seized
as
contraband
.
In
a
total
blockade
,
action
could
also
be
taken
against
ships
bringing
in
chemicals
,
oils
,
textiles
,
and
even
foodstuffs
.
At
times
,
three
ships
a
day
from
the
Soviet
bloc
are
unloading
in
Cuban
ports
.
From
its
inception
in
1920
with
the
passage
of
Public
Law
236
,
66th
Congress
,
the
purpose
of
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
has
been
to
assist
the
States
,
by
means
of
grants-in-aid
,
to
return
disabled
men
and
women
to
productive
,
gainful
employment
.
The
authority
for
the
program
was
renewed
several
times
until
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
was
made
permanent
as
Title
5
,
of
the
Social
Security
Act
in
1935
.
Up
to
this
time
and
for
the
next
eight
years
,
the
services
provided
disabled
persons
consisted
mainly
of
training
,
counseling
,
and
placement
on
a
job
.
Recognizing
the
limitations
of
such
a
program
,
the
78th
Congress
in
1943
passed
P.
L.
113
,
which
broadened
the
concept
of
rehabilitation
to
include
the
provision
of
physical
restoration
services
to
remove
or
reduce
disabilities
,
and
which
revised
the
financing
structure
.
Recent
changes
.
Despite
the
successful
rehabilitation
of
over
a
half
million
disabled
persons
in
the
first
eleven
years
after
1943
,
the
existing
program
was
still
seen
to
be
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
nation's
backlog
of
an
estimated
two
million
disabled
.
To
assist
the
States
,
therefore
,
in
rehabilitating
handicapped
individuals
,
``
so
that
they
may
prepare
for
and
engage
in
remunerative
employment
to
the
extent
of
their
capabilities
''
,
the
83rd
Congress
enacted
the
Vocational
Rehabilitation
Amendments
of
1954
(
P.
L.

These
amendments
to
the
Vocational
Rehabilitation
Act
were
designed
to
help
provide
for
more
specialized
rehabilitation
facilities
,
for
more
sheltered
and
``
half-way
''
workshops
,
for
greater
numbers
of
adequately
trained
personnel
,
for
more
comprehensive
services
to
individuals
(
particularly
to
the
homebound
and
the
blind
)
,
and
for
other
administrative
improvements
to
increase
the
program's
overall
effectiveness
.
Financial
aspects
.
Under
the
law
as
it
existed
until
1943
,
the
Federal
Government
made
grants
to
the
States
on
the
basis
of
population
,
matching
State
expenditures
on
a
50-50
basis
.
Under
P.
L.
113
,
78th
Congress
,
the
Federal
Government
assumed
responsibility
for
100%
of
necessary
State
expenditures
in
connection
with
administration
and
the
counseling
and
placement
of
the
disabled
,
and
for
50%
of
the
necessary
costs
of
providing
clients
with
rehabilitation
case
services
.
Throughout
these
years
,
the
statutory
authorization
was
for
such
sums
as
were
necessary
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
Act
.
The
1954
Amendments
completely
changed
the
financing
of
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
,
providing
for
a
three-part
grant
structure
--
for
(
1
)
basic
support
;
;
(
2
)
extension
and
improvement
;
;
and
(
3
)
research
,
demonstrations
,
training
and
traineeships
for
vocational
rehabilitation
--
and
in
addition
for
short-term
training
and
instruction
.
The
first
part
of
the
new
structure
--
that
for
supporting
the
basic
program
of
vocational
rehabilitation
services
--
is
described
in
this
Section
.
Subsequent
sections
on
grants
describe
the
other
categories
of
the
grant
structure
.
The
following

part
of

.
In
order
to
assist
the
States
in
maintaining
basic
vocational
rehabilitation
services
,
Section
2
of
the
amended
Act
provides
that
allotments
to
States
for
support
of
such
services
be
based
on
(
1
)
need
,
as
measured
by
a
State's
population
,
and
(
2
)
fiscal
capacity
,
as
measured
by
its
per
capita
income
.
The
Act
further
provides
for
a
``
floor
''
or
minimum
allotment
,
set
at
the
1954
level
,
which
is
called
the
``
base
''
allotment
,
and
a
``
ceiling
''
or
maximum
allotment
,
for
each
State
.
It
stipulates
,
in
addition
,
that
all
amounts
remaining
as
a
result
of
imposing
the
``
ceiling
''
,
and
not
used
for
insuring
the
``
floor
''
,
be
redistributed
to
those
States
still
below
their
maximums
.
These
provisions
are
designed
to
reflect
the
differences
in
wealth
and
population
among
the
States
,
with
the
objective
that
a
vocationally
handicapped
person
have
access
to
needed
services
regardless
of
whether
he
resides
in
a
State
with
a
low
or
high
per
capita
income
or
a
sparsely
or
thickly
populated
State
.
The
provisions
are
also
designed
to
avoid
disruption
in
State
programs
already
in
operation
,
which
might
otherwise
result
from
the
allotment
of
funds
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
population
alone
.
Method
of
computing
allotments
.
The
method
used
in
computing
the
allotments
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
Act
.
The
term
``
State
''
means
the
several
States
,
the
District
of
Columbia
,
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
;
;
the
term
``
United
States
''
includes
the
several
States
and
the
District
of
Columbia
,
and
excludes
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.
The
following
steps
are
employed
in
calculations
:
1
.
For
each
State
(
except
Puerto
Rico
,
Guam
,
the
Virgin
Islands
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
determine
average
per
capita
income
based
on
the
last
three
years
.
(

per
capita
income
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)

.
Determine
the
average
per
capita
income
for
the
U.
S.
based
on
the
last
three
years
.
(

Source
of
Data
,
below
,
for
per

income
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)
3
.
Determine
the
ratio
of
50%
to
the
average
per
capita
income
of
the
U.
S.
(
Divide
50
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
2
above
.
)
4
.
Determine
for
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
that
percentage
which
bears
the
same
ratio
to
50%
as
the
particular
State's
average
per
capita
income
bears
to
the
average
per
capita
income
of
the
U.
S.
.
(
Multiply
the
result
obtained
in
item
3
above
by
the
result
obtained
for
each
State
in
item
1
above
.
)
5
.
Determine
the
particular
State's
``
allotment
percentage
''
.
By
law
this
is
75%
for
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
.
(
Alaska
and
Hawaii
had
fixed
allotment
percentages
in
effect
prior
to
fiscal
year
1962
.
)
In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
;
except
that
no
State
shall
have
an
allotment
percentage
less
than
33-1/3%
nor
more
than
75%
.
If
the
resulting
difference
for
the
particular
State
is
less
or
more
than
these
extremes
,
the
State's
allotment
percentage
must
be
raised
or
lowered
to
the
appropriate
extreme
.
6
.
Square
each
State's
allotment
percentage
.
7
.
Determine
each
State's
population
.
(
See
Source
of
Data
,
below
for
population
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)
8
.
Multiply
the
population
of
each
State
by
the
square
of
its
allotment
percentage
.
(
Multiply
result
obtained
in
item
7
above
,
by
result
obtained
in
item
6
above
.
)
9
.
Determine
the
sum
of
the
products
obtained
in
item
8
above
,
for
all
the
States
.
(
For
each
State
,
make
all
computations
set
forth
in
items
1
to
8
above
,
and
then
add
the
results
obtained
for
each
State
in
item
8
.
)
10
.
Determine
the
ratio
that
the
amount
being
allotted
is
to
the
sum
of
the
products
for
all
the
States
.
(
Divide
the
amount
being
allotted
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
9
above
.
)
11
.
Determine
the
particular
State's
unadjusted
allotment
for
the
particular
fiscal
year
.
(
Multiply
the
State
product
in
item
8
above
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
10
above
.
)
12
.
Determine
if
the
particular
State's
unadjusted
allotment
(
result
obtained
in
item
11
above
)
is
greater
than
its
maximum
allotment
,
and
if
so
lower
its
unadjusted
allotment
to
its
maximum
allotment
.
(
Each
State's
unadjusted
allotment
for
any
fiscal
year
,
which
exceeds
its
minimum
allotment
described
in
item
13
below
by
a
percentage
greater
than
one
and
one-half
times
the
percentage
by
which
the
sum
being
allotted
exceeds
$23,000,000
,
must
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
excess
.
)
13
.
Determine
if
the
particular
State's
unadjusted
allotment
(
result
obtained
in
item
11
above
)
is
less
than
its
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
,
and
if
so
raise
its
unadjusted
allotment
to
its
minimum
allotment
.
Regardless
of
its
unadjusted
allotment
,
each
State
is
guaranteed
by
law
a
minimum
allotment
each
year
equal
to
the
allotment
which
it
received
in
fiscal
year
1954
--
increased
by
a
uniform
percentage
of
5.4865771
which
brings
total
1954
allotments
to
all
States
up
to
$23,000,000
.
14
.
The
funds
recouped
by
reductions
in
item
12
above
are
used
:
first
,
to
increase
the
unadjusted
allotments
to
the
specified
minimum
in
those
States
where
the
unadjusted
allotment
is
less
than
the
minimum
allotment
(
item
13
above
)
;
;
and
second
,
to
increase
uniformly
the
allotments
to
those
States
whose
allotments
are
below
their
maximums
,
with
adjustments
to
prevent
the
allotment
of
any
State
from
thereby
exceeding
its
maximum
.
Additional
note
on
allotments
.
For
the
States
which
maintain
two
separate
agencies
--
one
for
the
vocational
rehabilitation
of
the
blind
,
and
one
for
the
rehabilitation
of
persons
other
than
the
blind
--
the
Act
specifies
that
their
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
shall
be
divided
between
the
two
agencies
in
the
same
proportion
as
it
was
divided
in
fiscal
year
1954
.
Funds
allotted
in
addition
to
their
minimum
allotment
are
apportioned
to
the
two
agencies
as
they
may
determine
.
Matching
requirements
explanation
of
matching
formula
.
As
is
the
case
with
the
allotment
provisions
for
support
of
vocational
rehabilitation
services
,
the
matching
requirements
are
also
based
on
a
statutory
formula
.
Prior
to
1960
,
in
order
to
provide
matching
for
the
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
,
State
funds
had
to
equal
1954
State
funds
.
Prior
to
and
since
1960
the
rest
of
the
support
allotment
is
matched
at
rates
related
to
the
fiscal
capacity
of
the
State
,
with
a
pivot
of
40%
State
(
or
60%
Federal
)
participation
in
total
program
costs
.
The
percentage
of
Federal
participation
in
such
costs
for
any
State
is
referred
to
in
the
law
as
that
State's
``
Federal
share
''
.
For
purposes
of
this
explanation
,
this
percentage
is
referred
to
as
the
State's
``
unadjusted
Federal
share
''
.
Beginning
in
1960
,
the
matching
requirements
for
the
base
allotment
are
being
adjusted
(
upward
or
downward
,
as
required
)
25%
a
year
,
so
that
by
1963
the
entire
support
allotment
will
be
matched
on
the
basis
of
a
40%
pivot
State
share
,
with
maximum
and
minimum
State
shares
of
50%
and
30%
,
respectively
.
The
pre-1960
rate
of
Federal
participation
with
respect
to
any
State's
base
allotment
,
as
well
as
the
adjusted
rate
in
effect
during
the
1960
-
1962
period
,
is
designated
by
the
statute
as
that
State's
``
adjusted
Federal
Share
''
.
The
provisions
for
determining
a
State's
unadjusted
Federal
share
are
designed
to
reflect
the
varying
financial
resources
among
the
States
.
The
purpose
of
the
adjusted
Federal
share
relating
to
the
base
allotment
and
of
the
transition
provisions
for
reaching
the
unadjusted
Federal
share
is
to
prevent
dislocations
from
abrupt
changes
in
matching
rates
.
Method
of
computing
Federal
shares
.
The
method
used
for
computing
the
respective
Federal
and
State
shares
in
total
program
costs
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
Act
.
The
term
``
State
''
means
the
several
States
,
the
District
of
Columbia
,
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
;
;
the
term
``
United
States
''
includes
the
several
States
and
the
District
of
Columbia
and
excludes
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.
The
following
steps
are
employed
in
the
calculations
:
1
.
For
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
,
Puerto
Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
,
determine
the
average
per
capita
income
for
the
last
three
years
.

.
Determine
the
ratio
of
40%
to
the
average
per

income
of
the
United
States
.
(
Divide
40
by
the
amount
used
in
item
2
above
.
)
4
.
Determine
for
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
,
Puerto
Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
,
that
percentage
which
bears
the
same
ration
to
40%
as
the
particular
State's
average
per
capita
income
bears
to
the
average
per
capita
income
of
the
United
States
.
(
Multiply
the
result
obtained
in
item
3
above
by
the
amount
used
for
each
State
in
item
1
above
.
)
5
.
Determine
the
particular
State's
``
Federal
Share
''
.
By
law
this
is
70%
for
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
.
(
Alaska
and
Hawaii
had
fixed
Federal
share
percentages
in
effect
prior
to
fiscal
year
1962
.
)
In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
;
except
that
no
State
shall
have
a
Federal
share
less
than
50%
nor
more
than
70%
.
If
the
resulting
difference
for
the
particular
State
is
less
or
more
than
these
extremes
,
the
State's
Federal
share
must
be
raised
or
lowered
to
the
appropriate
extreme
.
At
the
entrance
side
of
the
shelter
,
each
roof
beam
is
rested
on
the
inside
4
inches
of
the
block
wall
.
The
outside
4-inch
space
is
filled
by
mortaring
blocks
on
edge
.
The
wooden
bracing
between
the
roof
beams
is
placed
flush
with
the
inside
of
the
wall
.
Mortar
is
poured
between
this
bracing
and
the
4-inch
blocks
on
edge
to
complete
the
wall
thickness
for
radiation
shielding
.
(
For
details

.
)
The
first
one
or
two
roof
boards
(
marked
``
E
''
in
fig.
6
)
are
slipped
into
place
across
the
roof
beams
,
from
outside
the
shelter
.
These
boards
are
nailed
to
the
roof
beams
by
reaching
up
through
the
open
space
between
the
beams
,
from
inside
the
shelter
.
Concrete
blocks
are
passed
between
the
beams
and
put
on
the
boards
.
The
roof
blocks
are
in
two
layers
and
are
not
mortared
together
.
Work
on
the
roof
continues
in
this
way
.
The
last
roof
boards
are
covered
with
blocks
from
outside
the
shelter
.
When
the
roof
blocks
are
all
in
place
,
the
final
rows
of
wall
blocks
are
mortared
into
position
.
The
structure
is
complete
.

.
Solid
concrete
blocks
,
relatively
heavy
and
dense
,
are
used
for
this
shelter
.
These
blocks
are
sold
in
various
sizes
so
it
seldom
is
necessary
to
cut
a
block
to
fit
.
Solid
blocks
are
recommended
because
hollow
blocks
would
have
to
be
filled
with
concrete
to
give
effective
protection
.
Bricks
are
an
alternative
.
If
they
are
used
,
the
walls
and
roof
should
be
10
inches
thick
to
give
the
same
protection
as
the
8-inch
solid
concrete
blocks
.
The
illustrations
in
fig.

show
how
to
lay
a
concrete
block
wall

Plans
are
on
pages
22
and
23
.
This
shelter
could
be
built
in
regions
where
water
or
rock
is
close
to
the
surface
,
making
it
impractical
to
build
an
underground
shelter
.
Two
walls
of
concrete
blocks
are
constructed
at
least
20
inches
apart
.
The
space
between
them
is
filled
with
pit-run
gravel
or
earth
.
The
walls
are
held
together
with
metal
ties
placed
in
the
wet
mortar
as
the
walls
are
built
.
The
roof
shown
here
(
fig.
9
)
is
a
6-inch
slab
of
reinforced
concrete
,
covered
with
at
least
20
inches
of
pit-run
gravel
.
An
alternate
roof
,
perhaps
more
within
do-it-yourself
reach
,
could
be
constructed
of
heavy
wooden
roof
beams
,
overlaid
with
boards
and
waterproofing
.
It
would
have
to
be
covered
with
at
least
28
inches
of
pit-run
gravel
.
The
materials
for
a
double-wall
shelter
would
cost
about
$700
.
Contractors'
charges
would
be
additional
.
The
shelter
would
provide
almost
absolute
fallout
protection
.
Pre-shaped
metal
shelter
Pre-shaped
corrugated
metal
sections
or
pre-cast
concrete
can
be
used
for
shelters
either
above
or
below
ground
.
These
are
particularly
suitable
for
regions
where
water
or
rock
is
close
to
the
surface
.
They
form
effective
fallout
shelters
when
mounded
over
with
earth
,
as
shown
in
figure
10
.
Materials
for
this
shelter
would
cost
about
$700
.
A
contractor
probably
would
be
required
to
help
build
it
.
His
charges
would
be
added
to
the
cost
of
materials
.
This
shelter
,
as
shown
on
page
24
,
would
provide
almost
absolute
protection
from
fallout
radiation
.
An
alternate
hatchway
entrance
,
shown
on
page
25
,
would
reduce
the
cost
of
materials
$50
to
$100
.
The
National
Lumber
Manufacturers
Association
,
Washington
,
D.
C.
,
is
developing
plans
to
utilize
specially
treated
lumber
for
underground
shelter
construction
.
The
Structural
Clay
Products
Institute
,
Washington
,
D.C.
,
is
working
to
develop
brick
and
clay
products
suitable
for
shelter
construction
.
Underground
concrete
shelter
An
underground
reinforced
concrete
shelter
can
be
built
by
a
contractor
for
about
$1,000
to
$1,500
,
depending
on
the
type
of
entrance
.
The
shelter
shown
would
provide
almost
absolute
fallout
protection
.
The
illustration
(
fig.
11
)
shows
this
shelter
with
the
roof
at
ground
level
and
mounded
over
.
The
same
shelter
could
be
built
into
an
embankment
or
below
ground
level
.
Plans
for
the
shelter
,
with
either
a
stairway
or
hatchway
entrance
,
are
shown
on
pages
26
and
27
.
Another
type
of
shelter
which
gives
excellent
fallout
protection
can
be
built
as
an
added
room
to
the
basement
of
a
home
under
construction
.
It
would
add
about
$500
to
the
total
cost
of
the
home
.
The
shelter
illustrated
in
figure
12
is
based
on
such
a
room
built
in
a
new
home
in
the
Washington
,
D.C.
area
in
the
Spring
of
1959
.
Important
considerations
common
to
each
type
of
shelter
are
:
1
.
Arrangement
of
the
entrance
.
2
.
Ventilation
.
3
.
Radio
reception
.
4
.
Lighting
.
The
entrance
must
have
at
least
one
right-angle
turn
.
Radiation
scatters
somewhat
like
light
.
Some
will
go
around
a
corner
.
The
rest
continues
in
a
straight
line
.
Therefore
,
sharp
turns
in
a
shelter
entrance
will
reduce
radiation
intensity
inside
the
shelter
.
Ventilation
is
provided
in
a
concrete
block
basement
shelter
by
vents
in
the
wall
and
by
the
open
entrance
.
A
blower
may
be
installed
to
increase
comfort
.
A
blower
is
essential
for
the
double-wall
shelter
and
for
the
underground
shelters
.
It
should
provide
not
less
than
5
cubic
feet
per
minute
of
air
per
person
.
Vent
pipes
also
are
necessary
(
as
shown
in
figs.
9
,
10
,
and
11
)
,
but
filters
are
not
.
Radio
reception
is
cut
down
by
the
shielding
necessary
to
keep
out
radiation
.
As
soon
as
the
shelter
is
completed
a
radio
reception
check
must
be
made
.
It
probably
will
be
necessary
to
install
an
outside
antenna
,
particularly
to
receive
CONELRAD
broadcasts
.
Lighting
is
an
important
consideration
.
Continuous
low-level
lighting
may
be
provided
in
the
shelter
by
means
of
a
4-cell
hot-shot
battery
to
which
is
wired
a
150-milliampere
flashlight-type
bulb
.
Tests
have
shown
that
such
a
device
,
with
a
fresh
battery
,
will
furnish
light
continuously
for
at
least
10
days
.
With
a
spare
battery
,
a
source
of
light
for
2
weeks
or
more
would
be
assured
.
A
flashlight
or
electric
lantern
also
should
be
available
for
those
periods
when
a
brighter
light
is
needed
.
There
should
be
a
regular
electrical
outlet
in
the
shelter
as
power
may
continue
in
many
areas
.
Other
considerations
.
--
If
there
are
outside
windows
in
the
basement
corner
where
you
build
a
shelter
,
they
should
be
shielded
as
shown
in
the
Appendix
,
page
29
.
Other
basement
windows
should
be
blocked
when
an
emergency
threatens
.
Basement
walls
that
project
above
the
ground
should
be
shielded
as
shown
in
the
Appendix
,
page
29
.
In
these
shelters
the
entrance
should
be
not
more
than
2
feet
wide
.
Bunks
,
or
materials
to
build
them
,
may
have
to
be
put
inside
the
enclosure
before
the
shelter
walls
are
completed
.
The
basement
or
belowground
shelters
also
will
serve
for
tornado
or
hurricane
protection
.

.
Living
in
a
shelter
The
radioactivity
of
fallout
decays
rapidly
at
first
.
Forty-nine
hours
after
an
atomic
burst
the
radiation
intensity
is
only
about
1
percent
of
what
it
was
an
hour
after
the
explosion
.
But
the
radiation
may
be
so
intense
at
the
start
that
one
percent
may
be
extremely
dangerous
.
Therefore
,
civil
defense
instructions
received
over
CONELRAD
or
by
other
means
should
be
followed
.
A
battery-powered
radio
is
essential
.
Radiation
instruments
suitable
for
home
use
are
available
,
and
would
be
of
value
in
locating
that
portion
of
the
home
which
offers
the
best
protection
against
fallout
radiation
.
There
is
a
possibility
that
battery-powered
radios
with
built-in
radiation
meters
may
become
available
.
One
instrument
thus
would
serve
both
purposes
.
Your
local
civil
defense
will
gather
its
own
information
and
will
receive
broad
information
from
State
and
Federal
sources
.
It
will
tell
you
as
soon
as
possible
:
How
long
to
stay
in
your
shelter
;
;
How
soon
you
may
go
outdoors
;
;
How
long
you
may
stay
outside
.
You
should
be
prepared
to
stay
in
your
shelter
full
time
for
at
least
several
days
and
to
make
it
your
home
for
14
days
or
longer
.
A
checklist
in
the
Appendix
(
(
page
30
)
tells
what
is
needed
.
Families
with
children
will
have
particular
problems
.
They
should
provide
for
simple
recreation
.
There
should
be
a
task
for
everyone
and
these
tasks
should
be
rotated
.
Part
of
the
family
should
be
sleeping
while
the
rest
is
awake
.
To
break
the
monotony
it
may
be
necessary
to
invent
tasks
that
will
keep
the
family
busy
.
Records
such
as
diaries
can
be
kept
.
The
survival
of
the
family
will
depend
largely
on
information
received
by
radio
.
A
record
should
be
kept
of
the
information
and
instructions
,
including
the
time
and
date
of
broadcast
.
Family
rationing
probably
will
be
necessary
.
Blowers
should
be
operated
periodically
on
a
regular
schedule
.
There
will
come
a
time
in
a
basement
shelter
when
the
radiation
has
decayed
enough
to
allow
use
of
the
whole
basement
.
However
,
as
much
time
as
possible
should
be
spent
within
the
shelter
to
hold
radiation
exposure
to
a
minimum
.
The
housekeeping
problems
of
living
in
a
shelter
will
begin
as
soon
as
the
shelter
is
occupied
.
Food
,
medical
supplies
,
utensils
,
and
equipment
,
if
not
already
stored
in
the
shelter
,
must
be
quickly
gathered
up
and
carried
into
it
.
After
the
family
has
settled
in
the
shelter
,
the
housekeeping
rules
should
be
spelled
out
by
the
adult
in
charge
.
Sanitation
in
the
confines
of
the
family
shelter
will
require
much
thought
and
planning
.
Provision
for
emergency
toilet
facilities
and
disposal
of
human
wastes
will
be
an
unfamiliar
problem
.
A
covered
container
such
as
a
kitchen
garbage
pail
might
do
as
a
toilet
.
A
10-gallon
garbage
can
,
with
a
tightly
fitting
cover
,
could
be
used
to
keep
the
wastes
until
it
is
safe
to
leave
the
shelter
.
Water
rationing
will
be
difficult
and
should
be
planned
carefully
.
A
portable
electric
heater
is
advisable
for
shelters
in
cold
climates
.
It
would
take
the
chill
from
the
shelter
in
the
beginning
.
Even
if
the
electric
power
fails
after
an
attack
,
any
time
that
the
heater
has
been
used
will
make
the
shelter
that
much
more
comfortable
.
Body
heat
in
the
close
quarters
will
help
keep
up
the
temperature
.
Warm
clothing
and
bedding
,
of
course
,
are
essential
.
Open-flame
heating
or
cooking
should
be
avoided
.
A
flame
would
use
up
air
.
Some
families
already
have
held
weekend
rehearsals
in
their
home
shelters
to
learn
the
problems
and
to
determine
for
themselves
what
supplies
they
would
need
.
4
.
If
an
attack
finds
you
without
a
prepared
shelter
Few
areas
,
if
any
,
are
as
good
as
prepared
shelters
but
they
are
worth
knowing
about
.
A
family
dwelling
without
a
basement
provides
some
natural
shielding
from
fallout
radiation
.
On
the
ground
floor
the
radiation
would
be
about
half
what
it
is
outside
.
The
best
protection
would
be
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
central
part
of
the
house
.
A
belowground
basement
can
cut
the
fallout
radiation
to
one-tenth
of
the
outside
level
.
The
safest
place
is
the
basement
corner
least
exposed
to
windows
and
deepest
below
ground
.
If
there
is
time
after
the
warning
,
the
basement
shielding
could
be
improved
substantially
by
blocking
windows
with
bricks
,
dirt
,
books
,
magazines
,
or
other
heavy
material
.

Shelter
in
apartment
buildings
Large
apartment
buildings
of
masonry
or
concrete
provide
better
natural
shelter
than
the
usual
family
dwellings
.
In
general
,
such
apartments
afford
more
protection
than
smaller
buildings
because
their
walls
are
thick
and
there
is
more
space
.
The
central
area
of
the
ground
floor
of
a
heavily
constructed
apartment
building
,
with
concrete
floors
,
should
provide
more
fallout
protection
than
the
ordinary
basement
of
a
family
dwelling
.
The
basement
of
such
an
apartment
building
may
provide
as
much
natural
protection
as
the
specially
constructed
concrete
block
shelter
recommended
for
the
basement
of
a
family
dwelling
.
The
Federal
Government
is
aiding
local
governments
in
several
places
to
survey
residential
,
commercial
and
industrial
buildings
to
determine
what
fallout
protection
they
would
provide
,
and
for
how
many
people
.
The
problem
for
the
city
apartment
dweller
is
primarily
to
plan
the
use
of
existing
space
.
Such
planning
will
require
the
cooperation
of
other
occupants
and
of
the
apartment
management
.
A
former
Du
Pont
official
became
a
General
Motors
vice
president
and
set
about
maximizing
Du
Pont's
share
of
the
General
Motors
market
.
Lines
of
communications
were
established
between
the
two
companies
and
several
Du
Pont
products
were
actively
promoted
.
Within
a
few
years
various
Du
Pont
manufactured
items
were
filling
the
entire
requirements
of
from
four
to
seven
of
General
Motors'
eight
operating
divisions
.
The
Fisher
Body
division
,
long
controlled
by
the
Fisher
brothers
under
a
voting
trust
even
though
General
Motors
owned
a
majority
of
its
stock
,
followed
an
independent
course
for
many
years
,
but
by
1947
and
1948
``
resistance
had
collapsed
''
and
its
purchases
from
Du
Pont
``
compared
favorably
''
with
purchases
by
other
General
Motors
divisions
.
Competitors
came
to
receive
higher
percentage
of
General
Motors
business
in
later
years
,
but
it
is
``
likely
''
that
this
trend
stemmed
``
at
least
in
part
''
from
the
needs
of
General
Motors
outstripping
Du
Pont's
capacity
.
``
The
fact
that
sticks
out
in
this
voluminous
record
is
that
the
bulk
of
Du
Pont's
production
has
always
supplied
the
largest
part
of
the
requirements
of
the
one
customer
in
the
automobile
industry
connected
to
Du
Pont
by
a
stock
interest
.
The
inference
is
overwhelming
that
Du
Pont's
commanding
position
was
promoted
by
its
stock
interest
and
was
not
gained
solely
on
competitive
merit
''
.
353

S.

at

.
This
Court
agreed
with
the
trial
court
``
that
considerations
of
price
,
quality
and
service
were
not
overlooked
by
either
Du
Pont
or
General
Motors
''
.
353
U.
S.
,
at
606
.
However
,
it
determined
that
neither
this
factor
,
nor
``
the
fact
that
all
concerned
in
high
executive
posts
in
both
companies
acted
honorably
and
fairly
,
each
in
the
honest
conviction
that
his
actions
were
in
the
best
interests
of
his
own
company
and
without
any
design
to
overreach
anyone
,
including
Du
Pont's
competitors
''
,
outweighed
the
Government's
claim
for
relief
.
This
claim
,
as
submitted
to
the
District
Court
and
dismissed
by
it
,
126
F.Supp.235
,
alleged
violation
not
only
of
7
of
the
Clayton
Act
,
but
also
of
1
and
2
of
the
Sherman
Act
.
The
latter
provisions
proscribe
any
contract
,
combination
,
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
interstate
or
foreign
trade
,
and
monopolization
of
,
or
attempts
,
combinations
,
or
conspiracies
to
monopolize
,
such
trade
.
However
,
this
Court
put
to
one
side
without
consideration
the
Government's
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
its
Sherman
Act
allegations
.
It
rested
its
decision
solely
on
7
,
which
reads
in
pertinent
part
:
``
No
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
shall
acquire
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
or
other
share
capital
of
another
corporation
engaged
also
in
commerce
,
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
the
corporation
whose
stock
is
so
acquired
and
the
corporation
making
the
acquisition
,
or
to
restrain
such
commerce
in
any
section
or
community
,
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
of
any
line
of
commerce
.
This
section
shall
not
apply
to
corporations
purchasing
such
stock
solely
for
investment
and
not
using
the
same
by
voting
or
otherwise
to
bring
about
,
or
in
attempting
to
bring
about
,
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
.
''
The
purpose
of
this
provision
was
thus
explained
in
the
Court's
opinion
:
``
Section
7
is
designed
to
arrest
in
its
incipiency
not
only
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
a
competing
corporation
,
but
also
to
arrest
in
their
incipiency
restraints
or
monopolies
in
a
relevant
market
which
,
as
a
reasonable
probability
,
appear
at
the
time
of
suit
likely
to
result
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
all
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
any
other
corporation
.
The
section
is
violated
whether
or
not
actual
restraints
or
monopolies
,
or
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
,
have
occurred
or
are
intended
.
''
353

S.
,
at
589
.
Thus
,
a
finding
of
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
or
attempt
to
monopolize
was
excluded
from
the
Court's
decision
.
Indeed
,
as
already
noted
,
the
Court
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
executives
involved
in
the
dealings
between
Du
Pont
and
General
Motors
acted
``
honorably
and
fairly
''
and
exercised
their
business
judgment
only
to
serve
what
they
deemed
the
best
interests
of
their
own
companies
.
This
,
however
,
did
not
bar
finding
that
Du
Pont
had
become
pre-eminent
as
a
supplier
of
automotive
fabrics
and
finishes
to
General
Motors
;
;
that
these
products
constituted
a
``
line
of
commerce
''
within
the
meaning
of
the
Clayton
Act
;
;
that
General
Motors'
share
of
the
market
for
these
products
was
substantial
;
;
and
that
competition
for
this
share
of
the
market
was
endangered
by
the
financial
relationship
between
the
two
concerns
:
``
The
statutory
policy
of
fostering
free
competition
is
obviously
furthered
when
no
supplier
has
an
advantage
over
his
competitors
from
an
acquisition
of
his
customer's
stock
likely
to
have
the
effects
condemned
by
the
statute
.
We
repeat
,
that
the
test
of
a
violation
of
7
is
whether
,
at
the
time
of
suit
,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
acquisition
is
likely
to
result
in
the
condemned
restraints
.
The
conclusion
upon
this
record
is
inescapable
that
such
likelihood
was
proved
as
to
this
acquisition
.

On
the
basis
of
the
findings
which
led
to
this
conclusion
,
the
Court
remanded
the
case
to
the
District
Court
to
determine
the
appropriate
relief
.
The
sole
guidance
given
the
Court
for
discharging
the
task
committed
to
it
was
this
:
``
The
judgment
must
therefore
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded

Court

determination

proceedings

Court

.
This
Court's
judgment
was
filed
in
the
District
Court
on
July
18
,
1957
.
The
first
pretrial
conference
--
held
to
appoint
amici
curiae
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
of
Du
Pont
and
General
Motors
and
to
consider
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
the
subsequent
hearings
--
took
place
on
September
25
,
1957
.
At
the
outset
,
the
Government's
spokesman
explained
that
counsel
for
the
Government
and
for
Du
Pont
had
already
held
preliminary
discussions
with
a
view
to
arriving
at
a
relief
plan
that
both
sides
could
recommend
to
the
court
.
Du
Pont
,
he
said
,
had
proposed
disenfranchisement
of
its
General
Motors
stock
along
with
other
restrictions
on
the
Du
Pont
-
General
Motors
relationship
.
The
Government
,
deeming
these
suggestions
inadequate
,
had
urged
that
any
judgment
include
divestiture
of
Du
Pont's
shares
of
General
Motors
.
Counsel
for
the
Government
invited
Du
Pont's
views
on
this
proposal
before
recommending
a
specific
program
,
but
stated
that
if
the
court
desired
,
or
if
counsel
for
Du
Pont
thought
further
discussion
would
not
be
profitable
,
the
Government
was
prepared
to
submit
a
plan
within
thirty
days
.
Counsel
for
Du
Pont
indicated
a
preference
for
the
submission
of
detailed
plans
by
both
sides
at
an
early
date
.
No
previous
antitrust
case
,
he
said
,
had
involved
interests
of
such
magnitude
or
presented
such
complex
problems
of
relief
.
The
submission
of
detailed
plans
would
place
the
issues
before
the
court
more
readily
than
would
discussion
of
divestiture
or
disenfranchisement
in
the
abstract
.
The
Court
adopted
this
procedure
with
an
appropriate
time
schedule
for
carrying
it
out
.
The
Government
submitted
its
proposed
decree
on
October
25
,
1957
.
The
plan
called
for
divestiture
by
Du
Pont
of
its
63,000,000
shares
of
General
Motors
stock
by
equal
annual
distributions
to
its
stockholders
,
as
a
dividend
,
over
a
period
of
ten
years
.
Christiana
Securities
Company
and
Delaware
Realty
&
Investment
Company
,
major
stockholders
in
Du
Pont
,
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
were
dealt
with
specially
by
provisions
requiring
the
annual
sale
by
a
trustee
,
again
over
a
ten-year
period
,
of
Du
Pont's
General
Motors
stock
allocable
to
them
,
as
well
as
any
General
Motors
stock
which
Christiana
and
Delaware
owned
outright
.
If
,
in
the
trustee's
judgment
,
``
reasonable
market
conditions
''
did
not
prevail
during
any
given
year
,
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
petition
the
court
for
an
extension
of
time
within
the
ten-year
period
.
In
addition
,
the
right
to
vote
the
General
Motors
stock
held
by
Du
Pont
was
to
be
vested
in
Du
Pont's
stockholders
,
other
than
Christiana
and
Delaware
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
;
;
Du
Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
were
to
be
enjoined
from
acquiring
stock
in
or
exercising
control
over
General
Motors
;
;
Du
Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
were
to
be
prohibited
to
have
any
director
or
officer
in
common
with
General
Motors
,
and
vice
versa
;
;
and
General
Motors
and
Du
Pont
were
to
be
ordered
to
terminate
any
agreement
that
provided
for
the
purchase
by
General
Motors
of
any
specified
percentage
of
its
requirements
of
any
Du
Pont
manufactured
product
,
or
for
the
grant
of
exclusive
patent
rights
,
or
for
a
grant
by
General
Motors
to
Du
Pont
of
a
preferential
right
to
make
or
sell
any
chemical
discovery
of
General
Motors
,
or
for
the
maintenance
of
any
joint
commercial
enterprise
by
the
two
companies
.
On
motion
of
the
Amici
Curiae
,
the
court
directed
that
a
ruling
be
obtained
from
the
Commissioner
of
Internal
Revenue
as
to
the
federal
income
tax
consequences
of
the
Government's
plan
.
On
May
9
,
1958
,
the
Commissioner
announced
his
rulings
.
The
annual
dividends
paid
to
Du
Pont
stockholders
in
shares
of
General
Motors
stock
would
be
taxable
as
ordinary
income
to
the
extent
of
Du
Pont's
earnings
and
profits
.
The
measure
,
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
,
of
the
dividend
to
individual
stockholders
would
be
the
fair
market
value
of
the
shares
at
the
time
of
each
annual
distribution
.
In
the
case
of
taxpaying
corporate
stockholders
,
the
measure
would
be
the
lesser
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
shares
or
Du
Pont's
tax
basis
for
them
,
which
is
approximately
$2.09
per
share
.
The
forced
sale
of
the
General
Motors
stock
owned
by
or
allocable
to
Christiana
,
Delaware
,
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
,
and
deposited
with
the
trustee
,
would
result
in
a
tax
to
those
parties
at
the
capital
gains
rate
.
Du
Pont's
counterproposal
was
filed
on
May
14
,
1958
.
Under
its
plan
Du
Pont
would
retain
its
General
Motors
shares
but
be
required
to
pass
on
to
its
stockholders
the
right
to
vote
those
shares
.
Christiana
and
Delaware
would
,
in
turn
,
be
required
to
pass
on
the
voting
rights
to
the
General
Motors
shares
allocable
to
them
to
their
own
stockholders
.
Du
Pont
would
be
enjoined
from
having
as
a
director
,
officer
,
or
employee
anyone
who
was
simultaneously
an
officer
or
employee
of
General
Motors
,
and
no
director
,
officer
,
or
employee
of
Du
Pont
could
serve
as
a
director
of
General
Motors
without
court
approval
.
Du
Pont
would
be
denied
the
right
to
acquire
any
additional
General
Motors
stock
except
through
General
Motors'
distributions
of
stock
or
subscription
rights
to
its
stockholders
.
On
June
6
,
1958
,
General
Motors
submitted
its
objections
to
the
Government's
proposal
.
It
argued
,
inter
alia
,
that
a
divestiture
order
would
severely
depress
the
market
value
of
the
stock
of
both
General
Motors
and
Du
Pont
,
with
consequent
serious
loss
and
hardship
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
investors
,
among
them
thousands
of
small
trusts
and
charitable
institutions
;
;
that
there
would
be
a
similar
decline
in
the
market
values
of
other
automotive
and
chemical
stocks
,
with
similar
losses
to
the
stockholders
of
those
companies
;
;
that
the
tremendous
volume
of
General
Motors
stock
hanging
over
the
market
for
ten
years
would
hamper
the
efforts
of
General
Motors
and
other
automobile
manufacturers
to
raise
equity
capital
;
;
and
that
all
this
would
have
a
serious
adverse
effect
on
the
entire
stock
market
and
on
general
business
activity
.
General
Motors
comprehensively
contended
that
the
Government
plan
would
not
be
``
in
the
public
interest
''
as
required
by
the
mandate
of
this
Court
.
The
decrees
proposed
by
the
amici
curiae
were
filed
in
August
of
1958
.
These
plans
,
like
Du
Pont's
,
contained
provisions
for
passing
the
vote
on
Du
Pont's
General
Motors
shares
on
to
the
ultimate
stockholders
of
Du
Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
,
except
that
officers
and
directors
of
the
three
companies
,
their
spouses
,
and
other
people
living
in
their
households
,
as
well
as
other
specified
persons
,
were
to
be
totally
disenfranchised
.
Both
plans
also
prohibited
common
directors
,
officers
,
or
employees
between
Du
Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
General
Motors
on
the
other
.
It
is
not
a
medieval
mental
quirk
or
an
attitude
``
unnourished
by
sense
''
to
believe
that
husbands
and
wives
should
not
be
subjected
to
such
a
risk
,
or
that
such
a
possibility
should
not
be
permitted
to
endanger
the
confidentiality
of
the
marriage
relationship
.
While
it
is
easy
enough
to
ridicule
Hawkins'
pronouncement
in
Pleas
Of
The
Crown
from
a
metaphysical
point
of
view
,
the
concept
of
the
``
oneness
''
of
a
married
couple
may
reflect
an
abiding
belief
that
the
communion
between
husband
and
wife
is
such
that
their
actions
are
not
always
to
be
regarded
by
the
criminal
law
as
if
there
were
no
marriage
.
By
making
inroads
in
the
name
of
law
enforcement
into
the
protection
which
Congress
has
afforded
to
the
marriage
relationship
,
the
Court
today
continues
in
the
path
charted
by
the
recent
decision
in
Wyatt
v.
United
States
,
362
U.S.
525
,
where
the
Court
held
that
,
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case
,
a
wife
could
be
compelled
to
testify
against
her
husband
over
her
objection
.
One
need
not
waver
in
his
belief
in
virile
law
enforcement
to
insist
that
there
are
other
things
in
American
life
which
are
also
of
great
importance
,
and
to
which
even
law
enforcement
must
accommodate
itself
.
One
of
these
is
the
solidarity
and
the
confidential
relationship
of
marriage
.
The
Court's
opinion
dogmatically
asserts
that
the
husband-wife
conspiracy
doctrine
does
not
in
fact
protect
this
relationship
,
and
that
hence
the
doctrine
``
enthrones
an
unreality
into
a
rule
of
law
''
.
I
am
not
easily
persuaded
that
a
rule
accepted
by
so
many
people
for
so
many
centuries
can
be
so
lightly
dismissed
.
But
in
any
event
,
I
submit
that
the
power
to
depose
belongs
to
Congress
,
not
to
this
Court
.
I
dissent
.

was
denied
due
process
,
both
in
the
proceedings

officer
of

says
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
rebut
before
the
hearing
officer
statements
attributed
to
him
by
the
local

all
in

,
1952
,
he
wrote
the
Board
,
protesting
this
classification
.
He
again
stated
that
he
was
``
a
regular
minister
''
;
;
that
he
was
``
devoting
an
average
of
100
hours
a
month
to
actual
preaching
publicly
''
,
in
addition
to
50
to
75
hours
in
other
ministerial
duties
,
and
that
he
opposed
war
in
any
form
.
Thereafter
he
was
classified
1-o
.
On
April
1
,
1953
,
after
some
six
months
of
full-time
``
pioneering
''
,
petitioner
discontinued
devoting
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching
,
but
failed
to
so
notify
his
local
board
.
In
a
periodic
review
,
the
local
board
on
July
30
,
1953
,
reclassified
him
1-a
and
upheld
this
classification
after
a
personal
appearance
by
petitioner
,
because
of
his
willingness
to
kill
in
defense
of
his
church
and
home
.
Upon
administrative
approval
of
the
reclassification
,
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
June
11
,
1956
,
but
failed
to
do
so
.
He
was
not
prosecuted
,
however
,
and
his
case
was
subsequently
reopened
,
in
the
light
of
Sicurella
v.
United
States
,
348
U.S.
385
(
1955
)
.
He
was
again
reclassified
1-a
by
the
local
board
.
There
followed
a
customary
Department
of
Justice
hearing
,
at
which
petitioner
appeared
.
In
his
report
to
the
Attorney
General
,
the
hearing
officer
suggested
that
the
petitioner
be
exempt
only
from
combatant
training
and
service
.
On
March
21
,
1957
,
however
,
the
Department
recommended
approval
of
the
1-a
classification
.
Its
ground
for
this
recommendation
was
that
,
while
petitioner
claimed
before
the
local
board
August
17
,
1956
(
as
evidenced
by
its
memorandum
in
his
file
of
that
date
)
,
that
he
was
devoting
100
hours
per
month
to
actual
preaching
,
the
headquarters
of
the
Jehovah's
Witnesses
reported
that
he
was
no
longer
doing
so
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
relinquished
both
his
Pioneer
and
Bible
Student
Servant
positions
.
It
reported
that
he
now
devoted
only
some
6-1/2
hours
per
month
to
public
preaching
and
from
20
to
25
hours
per
month
to
church
activities
.
His
claim
was
therefore
``
so
highly
exaggerated
''
,
the
Department
concluded
,
that
it
``
cast
doubt
upon
his
veracity
and
,
consequently
,
upon
his
sincerity
and
good
faith
''
.
The
appeal
board
furnished
petitioner
a
copy
of
the
recommendation
.
In
his
answer
thereto
,
he
advised
the
Board
that
he
had
made
no
such
statement
in
1956
,
and
asserted
that
his
only
claim
to
``
pioneering
''
was
in
1952
.
The
appeal
board
,
however
,
unanimously
concurred
in
the
Department's
recommendation
.
Upon
return
of
the
file
to
the
local
board
,
petitioner
was
again
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
this
prosecution
followed
his
failure
to
do
so
.
Petitioner
first
contends
that
the
Department
denied
him
procedural
due
process
by
not
giving
him
timely
opportunity
,
before
its
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
,
to
answer
the
statement
of
the
local
board
as
to
his
claim
of
devoting
100
hours
to
actual
preaching
.
But
the
statement
of
the
local
board
attributing
this
claim
to
petitioner
was
in
his
file
.
He
admitted
that
he
knew
it
was
open
to
him
at
all
times
,
and
he
could
have
rebutted
it
before
the
hearing
officer
.
This
he
failed
to
do
,
asserting
that
he
did
not
know
it
to
be
in
his
file
.
Apparently
he
never
took
the
trouble
to
find
out
.
Nevertheless
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
contest
the
statement
before
the
appeal
board
.
After
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
is
forwarded
to
the
appeal
board
,
that
is
the
appropriate
place
for
a
registrant
to
lodge
his
denial
.
This
he
did
.
We
found
in
Gonzales
v.
United
States
,
supra
,
that
this
was
the
controlling
reason
why
copies
of
the
recommendation
should
be
furnished
a
registrant
.
We
said
there
that
it
was
necessary
``
that
a
registrant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
rebut
(
the
Department's
)
recommendation
when
it
comes
to
the
Appeal
Board
,
the
agency
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
classification
''
.
348
U.S.
,
at
412
.
We
fail
to
see
how
such
procedure
resulted
in
any
prejudice
to
petitioner's
contention
,
which
was
considered
by
the
appeal
board
and
denied
by
it
.
As
was
said
in
Gonzales
,
``
it
is
the
Appeal
Board
which
renders
the
selective
service
determination
considered
'
final
'
in
the
courts
,
not
to
be
overturned
unless
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
.
Estep
v.
United
States
,
327
U.S.

''
.
348
U.
S.
,
at
412-413
.
But
there
are
other
contentions
which
might
be
considered
more
difficult
.
At
his
trial
,
petitioner
sought
to
secure
through
subpoena
duces
tecum
the
longhand
notes
of
the
Department's
hearing
officer
,
Evensen
,
as
well
as
his
report
thereon
.
Petitioner
also
claimed
at
trial
the
right
to
inspect
the
original
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
reports
to
the
Department
of
Justice
.
He
alleged
no
specific
procedural
errors
or
evidence
withheld
;
;
nor
did
he
elaborate
just
what
favorable
evidence
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
reports
might
disclose
.
Section
6(j)
of
the
Act
,
as
we
have
held
,
does
require
the
Department's
recommendation
to
be
placed
in
a
registrant's
file
.
Gonzales
v.
United
States
,
supra
.
But
there
is
nothing
in
the
Act
requiring
the
hearing
officer's
report
to
be
likewise
turned
over
to
the
registrant
.
While
the
regulations
formerly
required
that
the
hearing
officer's
report
be
placed
in
the
registrant's
file
,
this
requirement
was
eliminated
in
1952
.
Moreover
,
the
hearing
officer's
report
is
but
intradepartmental
,
is
directed
to
the
Attorney
General
and
,
of
course
,
is
not
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
.
It
is
not
essentially
different
from
a
memorandum
of
an
attorney
in
the
Department
of
Justice
,
of
which
the
Attorney
General
receives
many
,
and
to
which
he
may
give
his
approval
or
rejection
.
It
is
but
part
of
the
whole
process
within
the
Department
that
goes
into
the
making
of
the
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
.
It
is
also
significant
that
neither
this
report
nor
the
hearing
officer's
notes
were
furnished
to
the
appeal
board
.
Hence
the
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
to
traverse
the
only
conclusions
of
the
Department
on
file
with
the
Board
.
Petitioner
knew
that
the
Department's
recommendation
was
based
not
on
the
hearing
officer's
report
but
on
the
statement
of
the
local
board
in
his
file
.
Having
had
every
opportunity
to
rebut
the
finding
of
the
local
board
before
both
the
hearing
officer
and
the
appeal
board
,
petitioner
cannot
now
claim
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
he
did
not
succeed
.
It
appears
to
us
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
production
of
the
hearing
officer's
report
and
notes
at
the
trial
.
In
addition
,
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
any
particular
need
for
the
report
and
notes
.
While
there
are
now
allegations
of
the
withholding
of
``
favorable
evidence
developed
at
the
hearing
''
and
a
denial
of
a
``
full
and
fair
hearing
''
,
no
such
claim
was
made
by
petitioner
at
any
stage
of
the
administrative
process
.
Moreover
,
his
testimony
at
trial
never
developed
any
such
facts
.
In
the
light
of
these
circumstances
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
issue
at
trial
in
this
respect
centered
entirely
on
the
Department's
recommendation
,
which
petitioner
repudiated
but
which
both
the
appeal
board
and
the
courts
below
found
supported
by
the
record
,
we
find
no
relevancy
in
the
hearing
officer's
report
and
notes
.
Finally
petitioner
says
that
he
was
entitled
to
inspect
the
FBI
report
during
the
proceedings
before
the
hearing
officer
as
well
as
at
the
trial
.
He
did
receive
a
resume
of
it
--
the
same
that
was
furnished
the
appeal
board
--
and
he
made
no
claim
of
its
inaccuracy
.
Even
now
no
such
claim
is
asserted
.
He
bases
his
present
contention
on
the
general
right
to
explore
,
indicating
that
he
hopes
to
find
some
discrepancy
in
the
resume
.
But
this
is
fully
answered
by
United
States
v.
Nugent
,
supra
.
There
we
held
``
that
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
,
within
the
selective
service
system
,
entitles
[
conscientious
objectors
]
to
no
guarantee
that
the
FBI
reports
must
be
produced
for
their
inspection
''
.
346
U.S.
,
at
5-6
.
Even
if
we
were
not
bound
by
Nugent
,
petitioner
here
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
report
.
The
recommendation
of
the
Department
--
as
well
as
the
decision
of
the
appeal
board
--
was
based
entirely
on
the
local
board
file
,
not
on
an
FBI
report
.
Foreign
policy
in
its
total
context
With
this
enlarged
role
in
mind
,
I
should
like
to
make
a
few
suggestions
:
What
we
in
the
United
States
do
or
do
not
do
will
make
a
very
large
difference
in
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
We
in
this
Department
must
think
about
foreign
policy
in
its
total
context
.
We
cannot
regard
foreign
policy
as
something
left
over
after
defense
policy
or
trade
policy
or
fiscal
policy
has
been
extracted
.
Foreign
policy
is
the
total
involvement
of
the
American
people
with
peoples
and
governments
abroad
.
That
means
that
,
if
we
are
to
achieve
a
new
standard
of
leadership
,
we
must
think
in
terms
of
the
total
context
of
our
situation
.
It
is
the
concern
of
the
Department
of
State
that
the
American
people
are
safe
and
secure
--
defense
is
not
a
monopoly
concern
of
the
Department
of
Defense
.
It
is
also
the
concern
of
the
Department
of
State
that
our
trading
relationships
with
the
rest
of
the
world
are
vigorous
,
profitable
,
and
active
--
this
is
not
just
a
passing
interest
or
a
matter
of
concern
only
to
the
Department
of
Commerce
.
We
can
no
longer
rely
on
interdepartmental
machinery
``
somewhere
upstairs
''
to
resolve
differences
between
this
and
other
departments
.
Assistant
Secretaries
of
State
will
now
carry
an
increased
burden
of
active
formulation
and
coordination
of
policies
.
Means
must
be
found
to
enable
us
to
keep
in
touch
as
regularly
and
as
efficiently
as
possible
with
our
colleagues
in
other
departments
concerned
with
foreign
policy
.
I
think
we
need
to
concern
ourselves
also
with
the
timeliness
of
action
.
Every
policy
officer
cannot
help
but
be
a
planning
officer
.
Unless
we
keep
our
eyes
on
the
horizon
ahead
,
we
shall
fail
to
bring
ourselves
on
target
with
the
present
.
The
movement
of
events
is
so
fast
,
the
pace
so
severe
,
that
an
attempt
to
peer
into
the
future
is
essential
if
we
are
to
think
accurately
about
the
present
.
If
there
is
anything
which
we
can
do
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
Government
to
speed
up
the
processes
by
which
we
come
to
decisions
on
matters
on
which
we
must
act
promptly
,
that
in
itself
would
be
a
major
contribution
to
the
conduct
of
our
affairs
.
Action
taken
today
is
often
far
more
valuable
than
action
taken
several
months
later
in
response
to
a
situation
then
out
of
control
.
There
will
of
course
be
times
for
delay
and
inaction
.
What
I
am
suggesting
is
that
when
we
delay
,
or
when
we
fail
to
act
,
we
do
so
intentionally
and
not
through
inadvertence
or
through
bureaucratic
or
procedural
difficulties
.
I
also
hope
that
we
can
do
something
about
reducing
the
infant
mortality
rate
of
ideas
--
an
affliction
of
all
bureaucracies
.
We
want
to
stimulate
ideas
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
Department
.
We
want
to
make
sure
that
our
junior
colleagues
realize
that
ideas
are
welcome
,
that
initiative
goes
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
goes
all
the
way
to
the
top
.
I
hope
no
one
expects
that
only
Presidential
appointees
are
looked
upon
as
sources
of
ideas
.
The
responsibility
for
taking
the
initiative
in
generating
ideas
is
that
of
every
officer
in
the
Department
who
has
a
policy
function
,
regardless
of
rank
.
Further
,
I
would
hope
that
we
could
pay
attention
to
little
things
.
While
observing
the
operations
of
our
Government
in
various
parts
of
the
world
,
I
have
felt
that
in
many
situations
where
our
policies
were
good
we
have
tended
to
ignore
minor
problems
which
spoiled
our
main
effort
.
To
cite
only
a
few
examples
:
The
wrong
man
in
the
wrong
position
,
perhaps
even
in
a
junior
position
abroad
,
can
be
a
source
of
great
harm
to
our
policy
;
;
the
attitudes
of
a
U.N.
delegate
who
experiences
difficulty
in
finding
adequate
housing
in
New
York
City
,
or
of
a
foreign
diplomat
in
similar
circumstances
in
our
Capital
,
can
easily
be
directed
against
the
United
States
and
all
that
it
stands
for
.
Dozens
of
seemingly
small
matters
go
wrong
all
over
the
world
.
Sometimes
those
who
know
about
them
are
too
far
down
the
line
to
be
able
to
do
anything
about
them
.
I
would
hope
that
we
could
create
the
recognition
in
the
Department
and
overseas
that
those
who
come
across
little
things
going
wrong
have
the
responsibility
for
bringing
these
to
the
attention
of
those
who
can
do
something
about
them
.
If
the
Department
of
State
is
to
take
primary
responsibility
for
foreign
policy
in
Washington
,
it
follows
that
the
ambassador
is
expected
to
take
charge
overseas
.
This
does
not
mean
in
a
purely
bureaucratic
sense
but
in
an
active
,
operational
,
interested
,
responsible
fashion
.
He
is
expected
to
know
about
what
is
going
on
among
the
representatives
of
other
agencies
who
are
stationed
in
his
country
.
He
is
expected
to
supervise
,
to
encourage
,
to
direct
,
to
assist
in
any
way
he
can
.
If
any
official
operation
abroad
begins
to
go
wrong
,
we
shall
look
to
the
ambassador
to
find
out
why
and
to
get
suggestions
for
remedial
action
.
The
problems
of
a
policy
officer
It
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
interested
in
some
thoughts
which
I
expressed
privately
in
recent
years
,
in
the
hope
of
clearing
up
a
certain
confusion
in
the
public
mind
about
what
foreign
policy
is
all
about
and
what
it
means
,
and
of
developing
a
certain
compassion
for
those
who
are
carrying
such
responsibilities
inside
Government
.
I
tried
to
do
so
by
calling
to
their
attention
some
of
the
problems
that
a
senior
departmental
policy
officer
faces
.
This
means
practically
everybody
in
this
room
.
Whether
it
will
strike
home
for
you
or
not
will
be
for
you
to
determine
.
The
senior
policy
officer
may
be
moved
to
think
hard
about
a
problem
by
any
of
an
infinite
variety
of
stimuli
:
an
idea
in
his
own
head
,
the
suggestions
of
a
colleague
,
a
question
from
the
Secretary
or
the
President
,
a
proposal
by
another
department
,
a
communication
from
a
foreign
government
or
an
American
ambassador
abroad
,
the
filing
of
an
item
for
the
agenda
of
the
United
Nations
or
of
any
other
of
dozens
of
international
bodies
,
a
news
item
read
at
the
breakfast
table
,
a
question
to
the
President
or
the
Secretary
at
a
news
conference
,
a
speech
by
a
Senator
or
Congressman
,
an
article
in
a
periodical
,
a
resolution
from
a
national
organization
,
a
request
for
assistance
from
some
private
American
interests
abroad
,
et
cetera
,
ad
infinitum
.
The
policy
officer
lives
with
his
antennae
alerted
for
the
questions
which
fall
within
his
range
of
responsibility
.
His
first
thought
is
about
the
question
itself
:
Is
there
a
question
here
for
American
foreign
policy
,
and
,
if
so
,
what
is
it
?
?
For
he
knows
that
the
first
and
sometimes
most
difficult
job
is
to
know
what
the
question
is
--
that
when
it
is
accurately
identified
it
sometimes
answers
itself
,
and
that
the
way
in
which
it
is
posed
frequently
shapes
the
answer
.
Chewing
it
over
with
his
colleagues
and
in
his
own
mind
,
he
reaches
a
tentative
identification
of
the
question
--
tentative
because
it
may
change
as
he
explores
it
further
and
because
,
if
no
tolerable
answer
can
be
found
,
it
may
have
to
be
changed
into
one
which
can
be
answered
.
Meanwhile
he
has
been
thinking
about
the
facts
surrounding
the
problem
,
facts
which
he
knows
can
never
be
complete
,
and
the
general
background
,
much
of
which
has
already
been
lost
to
history
.
He
is
appreciative
of
the
expert
help
available
to
him
and
draws
these
resources
into
play
,
taking
care
to
examine
at
least
some
of
the
raw
material
which
underlies
their
frequently
policy-oriented
conclusions
.
He
knows
that
he
must
give
the
expert
his
place
,
but
he
knows
that
he
must
also
keep
him
in
it
.
He
is
already
beginning
to
box
the
compass
of
alternative
lines
of
action
,
including
doing
nothing
.
He
knows
that
he
is
thinking
about
action
in
relation
to
a
future
which
can
be
perceived
but
dimly
through
a
merciful
fog
.
But
he
takes
his
bearings
from
the
great
guidelines
of
policy
,
well-established
precedents
,
the
commitments
of
the
United
States
under
international
charters
and
treaties
,
basic
statutes
,
and
well-understood
notions
of
the
American
people
about
how
we
are
to
conduct
ourselves
,
in
policy
literature
such
as
country
papers
and
National
Security
Council
papers
accumulated
in
the
Department
.
He
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
general
principles
produce
conflicting
results
in
the
factual
situation
with
which
he
is
confronted
.
He
must
think
about
which
of
these
principles
must
take
precedence
.
He
will
know
that
general
policy
papers
written
months
before
may
not
fit
his
problem
because
of
crucial
changes
in
circumstance
.
He
is
aware
that
every
moderately
important
problem
merges
imperceptibly
into
every
other
problem
.
He
must
deal
with
the
question
of
how
to
manage
a
part
when
it
cannot
be
handled
without
relation
to
the
whole
--
when
the
whole
is
too
large
to
grasp
.
He
must
think
of
others
who
have
a
stake
in
the
question
and
in
its
answer
.
Who
should
be
consulted
among
his
colleagues
in
the
Department
or
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
Government
?
?
Which
American
ambassadors
could
provide
helpful
advice
?
?
Are
private
interests
sufficiently
involved
to
be
consulted
?
?
What
is
the
probable
attitude
of
other
governments
,
including
those
less
directly
involved
?
?
How
and
at
what
stage
and
in
what
sequence
are
other
governments
to
be
consulted
?
?
If
action
is
indicated
,
what
kind
of
action
is
relevant
to
the
problem
?
?
The
selection
of
the
wrong
tools
can
mean
waste
,
at
best
,
and
at
worst
an
unwanted
inflammation
of
the
problem
itself
.
Can
the
President
or
the
Secretary
act
under
existing
authority
,
or
will
new
legislation
and
new
money
be
required
?
?
Should
the
action
be
unilateral
or
multilateral
?
?
Is
the
matter
one
for
the
United
Nations
or
some
other
international
body
?
?
For
,
if
so
,
the
path
leads
through
a
complex
process
of
parliamentary
diplomacy
which
adds
still
another
dimension
to
the
problem
.
Respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
What
type
of
action
can
hope
to
win
public
support
,
first
in
this
country
and
then
abroad
?
?
For
the
policy
officer
will
know
that
action
can
almost
never
be
secret
and
that
in
general
the
effectiveness
of
policy
will
be
conditioned
by
the
readiness
of
the
country
to
sustain
it
.
He
is
interested
in
public
opinion
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
because
it
is
important
in
itself
,
and
,
second
,
because
he
knows
that
the
American
public
cares
about
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
.
And
,
given
probable
public
attitudes
--
about
which
reasonably
good
estimates
can
be
made
--
what
action
is
called
for
to
insure
necessary
support
?
?
May
I
add
a
caution
on
this
particular
point
?
?
We
do
not
want
policy
officers
below
the
level
of
Presidential
appointees
to
concern
themselves
too
much
with
problems
of
domestic
politics
in
recommending
foreign
policy
action
.
In
the
first
place
our
business
is
foreign
policy
,
and
it
is
the
business
of
the
Presidential
leadership
and
his
appointees
in
the
Department
to
consider
the
domestic
political
aspects
of
a
problem
.
Mr.
Truman
emphasized
this
point
by
saying
,
``
You
fellows
in
the
Department
of
State
don't
know
much
about
domestic
politics
''
.
This
is
an
important
consideration
.
If
we
sit
here
reading
editorials
and
looking
at
public-opinion
polls
and
other
reports
that
cross
our
desks
,
we
should
realize
that
this
is
raw
,
undigested
opinion
expressed
in
the
absence
of
leadership
.
What
the
American
people
will
do
turns
in
large
degree
on
their
leadership
.
We
cannot
test
public
opinion
until
the
President
and
the
leaders
of
the
country
have
gone
to
the
public
to
explain
what
is
required
and
have
asked
them
for
support
for
the
necessary
action
.
I
doubt
,
for
example
,
that
,
3
months
before
the
leadership
began
to
talk
about
what
came
to
be
the
Marshall
plan
,
any
public-opinion
expert
would
have
said
that
the
country
would
have
accepted
such
proposals
.
The
problem
in
the
policy
officer's
mind
thus
begins
to
take
shape
as
a
galaxy
of
utterly
complicated
factors
--
political
,
military
,
economic
,
financial
,
legal
,
legislative
,
procedural
,
administrative
--
to
be
sorted
out
and
handled
within
a
political
system
which
moves
by
consent
in
relation
to
an
external
environment
which
cannot
be
under
control
.
And
the
policy
officer
has
the
hounds
of
time
snapping
at
his
heels
.
While
there
should
be
no
general
age
limit
or
restriction
to
one
sex
,
there
will
be
particular
projects
requiring
special
maturity
and
some
open
only
to
men
or
to
women
.
The
Peace
Corps
should
not
pay
the
expenses
of
a
wife
or
family
,
unless
the
wife
is
also
accepted
for
full-time
Peace
Corps
work
on
the
same
project
.
There
should
be
no
draft
exemption
because
of
Peace
Corps
service
.
In
most
cases
service
in
the
Corps
will
probably
be
considered
a
ground
for
temporary
deferment
.
Peace
Corps
volunteers
obviously
should
not
be
paid
what
they
might
earn
in
comparable
activities
in
the
United
States
.
Nor
would
it
be
possible
in
many
cases
for
them
to
live
in
health
or
any
effectiveness
on
what
their
counterparts
abroad
are
paid
.
The
guiding
principle
indeed
should
not
be
anything
like
compensation
for
individual
services
.
Rather
the
principle
should
be
akin
to
that
of
the
allowance
.
Peace
Corps
volunteers
should
be
given
just
enough
to
provide
a
minimum
decent
standard
of
living
.
They
should
live
in
modest
circumstances
,
avoiding
all
conspicuous
consumption
.
Wherever
possible
they
should
live
with
their
host
country
counterparts
.
Some
special
health
requirements
might
have
to
be
met
.
For
example
,
it
probably
will
be
necessary
for
the
Corps
to
have
authority
to
pay
medical
expenses
of
volunteers
.
Perhaps
existing
Public
Health
Service
,
State
Department
and
Armed
Services
medical
facilities
can
be
utilized
.
For
readjustment
to
the
U.S.
,
volunteers
should
be
given
some
separation
allowance
at
the
end
of
their
overseas
service
,
based
on
the
length
of
time
served
.
7
.
In
what
part
of
the
government
should
the
Peace
Corps
be
established
?
?
The
idea
of
a
Peace
Corps
has
captured
the
imagination
of
a
great
many
people
.
Support
for
it
cuts
across
party
,
regional
,
ethnic
and
other
lines
.
The
Peace
Corps
,
therefore
,
offers
an
opportunity
to
add
a
new
dimension
to
our
approach
to
the
world
--
an
opportunity
for
the
American
people
to
think
anew
and
start
afresh
in
their
participation
in
world
development
.
For
this
,
the
Peace
Corps
should
be
administered
by
a
small
,
new
,
alive
agency
operating
as
one
component
in
our
whole
overseas
operation
.
Pending
the
reorganization
of
our
foreign
aid
structure
and
program
,
the
Peace
Corps
should
be
established
as
an
agency
in
the
Department
of
State
.
When
the
aid
operations
are
reorganized
the
Peace
Corps
should
remain
a
semi-autonomous
,
functional
unit
.
Meanwhile
,
the
Peace
Corps
could
be
physically
located
in
ICA's
facilities
and
depend
on
the
State
Department
and
ICA
for
administrative
support
and
,
when
needed
,
program
assistance
.
In
this
way
the
Peace
Corps
can
be
launched
with
its
own
identity
and
spirit
and
yet
receive
the
necessary
assistance
from
those
now
responsible
for
United
States
foreign
policy
and
our
overseas
operations
.
8
.
How
and
when
should
the
Peace
Corps
be
launched
?
?
The
Peace
Corps
can
either
begin
in
very
low
gear
,
with
only
preparatory
work
undertaken
between
now
and
when
Congress
finally
appropriates
special
funds
for
it
--
or
it
can
be
launched
now
and
in
earnest
by
executive
action
,
with
sufficient
funds
and
made
available
from
existing
Mutual
Security
appropriations
to
permit
a
number
of
substantial
projects
to
start
this
summer
.
The
Peace
Corps
should
be
launched
soon
so
that
the
opportunity
to
recruit
the
most
qualified
people
from
this
year's
graduating
classes
will
not
be
lost
.
Nor
should
we
lose
the
opportunity
to
use
this
summer
for
training
on
university
campuses
.
If
launched
in
a
careful
but
determined
way
within
the
next
few
weeks
,
the
Peace
Corps
could
have
several
hundred
persons
in
training
this
summer
for
placement
next
fall
.
Within
a
year
or
two
several
thousand
might
be
in
service
.
It
can
then
grow
steadily
as
it
proves
itself
and
as
the
need
for
it
is
demonstrated
.
9
.
What
would
the
first
projects
be
?
?
In
the
first
year
there
should
probably
be
considerable
emphasis
on
teaching
projects
.
The
need
here
is
most
clearly
felt
and
our
capacity
to
recruit
and
train
qualified
volunteers
in
a
short
period
of
time
is
greatest
.
There
would
,
however
,
be
a
variety
of
other
skills
--
medical
,
agricultural
,
engineering
--
which
would
be
called
for
in
the
first
year
through
the
private
agency
programs
and
through
the
provision
of
technician
helpers
to
existing
development
projects
.
The
first
year's
projects
should
also
be
spread
through
several
countries
in
Latin
America
,
Africa
and
Asia
.
10
.
How
will
the
Peace
Corps
be
received
abroad
?
?
Although
the
need
for
outside
trained
manpower
exists
in
every
newly
developing
nation
,
the
readiness
to
receive
such
manpower
,
or
to
receive
it
from
the
United
States
will
vary
from
country
to
country
.
A
certain
skepticism
about
the
coming
of
Americans
is
to
be
expected
in
many
quarters
.
Unfriendly
political
groups
will
no
doubt
do
everything
in
their
power
to
promote
active
hostility
.
But
there
are
indications
that
many
developing
nations
will
welcome
Peace
Corps
volunteers
,
and
that
if
the
volunteers
are
well
chosen
,
they
will
soon
demonstrate
their
value
and
make
many
friends
.
It
is
important
,
however
,
that
the
Peace
Corps
be
advanced
not
as
an
arm
of
the
Cold
War
but
as
a
contribution
to
the
world
community
.
In
presenting
it
to
other
governments
and
to
the
United
Nations
,
we
could
propose
that
every
nation
consider
the
formation
of
its
own
peace
corps
and
that
the
United
Nations
sponsor
the
idea
and
form
an
international
coordinating
committee
.
We
should
hope
that
peace
corps
projects
will
be
truly
international
and
that
our
citizens
will
find
themselves
working
alongside
citizens
of
the
host
country
and
also
volunteers
from
other
lands
.
In
any
case
,
our
Peace
Corps
personnel
should
be
offered
as
technician
helpers
in
development
projects
of
the
U.N.
and
other
international
agencies
.
The
Peace
Corps
is
not
a
diplomatic
or
propaganda
venture
but
a
genuine
experiment
in
international
partnership
.
Our
aim
must
be
to
learn
as
much
as
we
teach
.
The
Peace
Corps
offers
an
opportunity
to
bring
home
to
the
United
States
the
problems
of
the
world
as
well
as
an
opportunity
to
meet
urgent
host
country
needs
for
trained
manpower
.
If
presented
in
this
spirit
,
the
response
and
the
results
will
be
immeasurably
better
.
11
.
How
will
it
be
financed
?
?
The
already
appropriated
funds
within
the
discretion
of
the
President
and
Secretary
of
State
under
the
Mutual
Security
Act
are
the
only
immediately
available
source
of
financing
this
summer's
pilot
programs
of
the
Peace
Corps
.
If
it
is
decided
to
make
a
small
shift
which
may
be
required
from
military
aid
or
special
assistance
funds
,
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
Mutual
Security
Act
through
this
new
peaceful
program
,
this
will
be
a
hopeful
sign
to
the
world
.
Congress
should
then
be
asked
to
give
the
Peace
Corps
a
firm
legislative
foundation
for
the
next
fiscal
year
.
Specifically
,
Congress
should
consider
authorizing
the
Peace
Corps
to
receive
contributions
from
American
businesses
,
unions
,
civic
organizations
and
the
public
at
large
.
For
this
must
be
the
project
of
the
whole
American
people
.
An
Advisory
Council
of
outstanding
public
figures
with
experience
in
world
affairs
should
be
formed
to
give
the
program
continuing
guidance
and
to
afford
a
focal
point
for
public
understanding
.
Steps
should
also
be
taken
to
link
the
Food
for
Peace
Program
with
the
Peace
Corps
,
so
that
foreign
currencies
accumulated
by
the
sale
of
U.S.
surplus
food
under
P.L.
480
can
be
put
to
use
to
pay
some
of
the
host
country
expenses
of
Peace
Corps
personnel
.
The
extent
to
which
participating
bodies
such
as
U.
S.
voluntary
agencies
,
universities
,
international
organizations
,
and
the
host
country
or
institutions
in
the
host
country
can
and
should
share
the
cost
of
the
Peace
Corps
programs
must
be
fully
explored
.
12
.
Is
it
worth
the
cost
and
the
risks
?
?
No
matter
how
well
conceived
and
efficiently
run
,
there
probably
will
be
failures
.
These
could
be
costly
and
have
a
serious
effect
both
at
home
and
abroad
.
But
as
the
popular
response
suggests
,
the
potentiality
of
the
Peace
Corps
is
very
great
.
It
can
contribute
to
the
development
of
critical
countries
and
regions
.
It
can
promote
international
cooperation
and
good
will
toward
this
country
.
It
can
also
contribute
to
the
education
of
America
and
to
more
intelligent
American
participation
in
the
world
.
With
thousands
of
young
Americans
going
to
work
in
developing
areas
,
millions
of
Americans
will
become
more
directly
involved
in
the
world
than
ever
before
.
With
colleges
and
universities
carrying
a
large
part
of
the
program
,
and
with
students
looking
toward
Peace
Corps
service
,
there
will
be
an
impact
on
educational
curriculum
and
student
seriousness
.
The
letters
home
,
the
talks
later
given
by
returning
members
of
the
Peace
Corps
,
the
influence
on
the
lives
of
those
who
spend
two
or
three
years
in
hard
work
abroad
--
all
this
may
combine
to
provide
a
substantial
popular
base
for
responsible
American
policies
toward
the
world
.
And
this
is
meeting
the
world's
need
,
too
,
since
what
the
world
most
needs
from
this
country
is
better
understanding
of
the
world
.
The
Peace
Corps
thus
can
add
a
new
dimension
to
America's
world
policy
--
one
for
which
people
here
and
abroad
have
long
been
waiting
.
As
you
said
in
your
State
of
the
Union
message
,
``
The
problems
are
towering
and
unprecedented
--
and
the
response
must
be
towering
and
unprecedented
as
well
''
.
To
the
Congress
of
the
United
States
:
I
recommend
to
the
Congress
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
Peace
Corps
--
a
pool
of
trained
American
men
and
women
sent
overseas
by
the
U.S.
Government
or
through
private
organizations
and
institutions
to
help
foreign
countries
meet
their
urgent
needs
for
skilled
manpower
.
I
have
today
signed
an
Executive
Order
establishing
a
Peace
Corps
on
a
temporary
pilot
basis
.
The
temporary
Peace
Corps
will
be
a
source
of
information
and
experience
to
aid
us
in
formulating
more
effective
plans
for
a
permanent
organization
.
In
addition
,
by
starting
the
Peace
Corps
now
we
will
be
able
to
begin
training
young
men
and
women
for
overseas
duty
this
summer
with
the
objective
of
placing
them
in
overseas
positions
by
late
fall
.
This
temporary
Peace
Corps
is
being
established
under
existing
authority
in
the
Mutual
Security
Act
and
will
be
located
in
the
Department
of
State
.
Its
initial
expenses
will
be
paid
from
appropriations
currently
available
for
our
foreign
aid
program
.
Throughout
the
world
the
people
of
the
newly
developing
nations
are
struggling
for
economic
and
social
progress
which
reflects
their
deepest
desires
.
Our
own
freedom
,
and
the
future
of
freedom
around
the
world
,
depend
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
on
their
ability
to
build
growing
and
independent
nations
where
men
can
live
in
dignity
,
liberated
from
the
bonds
of
hunger
,
ignorance
and
poverty
.
One
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
the
achievement
of
this
goal
is
the
lack
of
trained
men
and
women
with
the
skill
to
teach
the
young
and
assist
in
the
operation
of
development
projects
--
men
and
women
with
the
capacity
to
cope
with
the
demands
of
swiftly
evolving
economics
,
and
with
the
dedication
to
put
that
capacity
to
work
in
the
villages
,
the
mountains
,
the
towns
and
the
factories
of
dozens
of
struggling
nations
.
The
vast
task
of
economic
development
urgently
requires
skilled
people
to
do
the
work
of
the
society
--
to
help
teach
in
the
schools
,
construct
development
projects
,
demonstrate
modern
methods
of
sanitation
in
the
villages
,
and
perform
a
hundred
other
tasks
calling
for
training
and
advanced
knowledge
.
To
meet
this
urgent
need
for
skilled
manpower
we
are
proposing
the
establishment
of
a
Peace
Corps
--
an
organization
which
will
recruit
and
train
American
volunteers
,
sending
them
abroad
to
work
with
the
people
of
other
nations
.
This
organization
will
differ
from
existing
assistance
programs
in
that
its
members
will
supplement
technical
advisers
by
offering
the
specific
skills
needed
by
developing
nations
if
they
are
to
put
technical
advice
to
work
.
They
will
help
provide
the
skilled
manpower
necessary
to
carry
out
the
development
projects
planned
by
the
host
governments
,
acting
at
a
working
level
and
serving
at
great
personal
sacrifice
.
There
is
little
doubt
that
the
number
of
those
who
wish
to
serve
will
be
far
greater
than
our
capacity
to
absorb
them
.
Wildlife
habitat
resources
In
1960
one-quarter
of
the
92.5
million
recreation
visits
to
the
National
Forests
and
Grasslands
were
for
the
primary
purpose
of
hunting
and
fishing
.
Hunter
and
fisherman
visits
since
1949
have
increased
8
times
faster
than
the
nationwide
sale
of
hunting
and
fishing
licenses
.
This
use
is
expected
to
increase
to
about
50
million
visits
by
1972
.
The
long-range
objective
of
habitat
management
is
to
make
it
fully
productive
so
as
to
support
fish
and
game
populations
to
contribute
to
the
need
for
public
use
and
enjoyment
.
The
wildlife
habitat
management
proposals
for
the
10-year
period
are
:
1
.
Revise
and
complete
wildlife
habitat
management
and
improvement
plans
for
all
administrative
units
,
assuring
proper
coordination
between
wildlife
habitat
management
and
other
resources
.
2
.
Inventory
and
evaluate
wildlife
habitat
resources
in
cooperation
with
other
Federal
agencies
and
with
the
States
in
which
National
Forests
and
Grasslands
are
located
,
as
a
basis
for
orderly
development
of
wildlife
habitat
improvement
and
coordination
programs
,
including
(
A
)
big-game
,
gamebird
,
and
small-game
habitat
surveys
and
investigations
on
the
186
million
acres
of
National
Forests
and
Grasslands
,
(
B
)
fishery
habitat
surveys
and
investigations
on
the
81,000
miles
of
National
Forest
fishing
streams
and
nearly
3
million
acres
of
lakes
and
impoundments
,
and
(
C
)
participation
in
planning
,
inspection
,
and
control
phases
of
all
habitat
improvement
,
land
and
water
use
projects
conducted
on
National
Forest
lands
by
States
,
other
Federal
agencies
,
and
private
groups
to
assure
that
projects
will
benefit
wildlife
and
be
in
harmony
with
other
resource
values
.
3
.
Improve
food
and
cover
on
1.5
million
acres
of
key
wildlife
areas
.
4
.
Develop
wildlife
openings
,
food
patches
,
and
game
ways
in
dense
vegetation
by
clearing
or
controlled
burning
on
400,000
acres
.
5
.
Improve
7,000
miles
of
fishing
streams
and
56,000
acres
of
lakes
by
stabilizing
banks
,
planting
streamside
cover
,
and
constructing
channel
improvements
.
Protection
The
total
adverse
impact
of
disease
,
insects
,
fire
,
weather
,
destructive
animals
,
and
other
forces
on
the
uses
and
values
of
forest
resources
is
not
generally
recognized
.
They
kill
and
destroy
,
retard
or
prevent
reproduction
and
growth
,
impair
and
damage
values
,
and
disrupt
uses
.
The
loss
in
growth
of
sawtimber
because
of
damage
by
destructive
agencies
in
the
United
States
in
1952
was
estimated
to
be
about
44
billion
board
feet
.
If
it
were
not
for
the
effect
of
destructive
agencies
,
sawtimber
growth
would
have
been
nearly
twice
as
great
as
the
47
billion
board
feet
in
1952
.
About
45
percent
of
the
loss
in
growth
was
attributable
to
disease
,
20
percent
to
insects
,
17
percent
to
fire
,
and
18
percent
to
weather
,
animals
,
and
various
other
causes
.
These
destructive
forces
also
have
a
seriously
adverse
effect
upon
the
watersheds
and
their
life-supporting
waterflows
,
and
upon
the
other
renewable
forest
resources
.
The
long-range
objective
is
to
hold
the
damage
from
destructive
agencies
below
the
level
which
would
seriously
interfere
with
intensive
management
of
the
National
Forest
System
under
principles
of
multiple
use
and
high-level
sustained
yield
of
products
and
services
.
This
can
be
accomplished
substantially
by
a
continued
trend
toward
better
facilities
and
techniques
for
fire
control
and
more
resources
to
cope
with
critical
fire
periods
,
and
a
more
intensive
application
of
a
program
of
prevention
,
detection
,
and
control
of
insect
and
disease
infestations
.
In
addition
to
direct
protection
measures
,
more
intensive
management
of
timber
resources
will
assist
in
reduction
of
losses
from
insects
and
disease
.
Protection
from
insects
and
disease
In
the
10-year
period
,
it
is
proposed
that
insect
and
disease
control
on
the
National
Forest
System
be
stepped
up
to
a
level
of
prevention
,
detection
,
and
control
of
insect
and
disease
infestations
that
will
substantially
reduce
the
occurrence
of
large
infestations
toward
the
end
of
the
initial
period
.
This
will
require
about
a
40
percent
increase
over
the
present
level
of
protection
.
The
work
will
consist
of
:
1
.
Intensification
of
present
activities
through
(
A
)
quicker
,
more
extensive
,
and
more
thorough
surveys
to
detect
incipient
outbreaks
;
;
(
B
)
more
reliable
evaluation
of
the
potential
of
initial
outbreaks
to
cause
widespread
damage
;
;
(
C
)
quicker
and
more
effective
control
action
in
the
initial
stages
to
prevent
a
large-scale
epidemic
.
The
initial
suppression
activities
would
cover
about
twice
the
acreage
currently
being
treated
.
2
.
Continuation
of
present
blister
rust
control
work
plus
extension
of
control
to
250,000
acres
not
now
protected
but
which
should
be
managed
for
white
pine
production
.
The
objective
is
to
achieve
sufficient
effectiveness
of
control
on
all
of
the
area
now
under
treatment
plus
the
additional
acres
so
that
after
the
initial
period
only
maintenance
control
will
be
needed
.
3
.
Initiating
a
program
to
control
dwarf
mistletoe
on
several
hundred
thousand
acres
of
selected
better
stands
of
young
softwood
sawtimber
on
better
growing
sites
.
4
.
Coordination
of
pest
control
objectives
with
timber
management
activities
to
reduce
losses
.
Protection
from
fire
It
is
proposed
that
in
10
years
all
commercial
timberlands
,
all
critical
watersheds
,
and
other
lands
in
the
National
Forest
System
developed
or
proposed
for
intensive
use
will
be
given
protection
from
fire
adequate
to
meet
the
fire
situation
in
the
worst
years
and
under
serious
peak
loads
.
This
will
include
125
million
acres
compared
with
23
million
acres
now
receiving
such
protection
.
An
additional
15
million
acres
will
be
given
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
but
adequate
to
meet
the
average
fire
situation
.
Meeting
these
levels
of
protection
from
fire
calls
for
:
1
.
Expansion
,
modernization
,
and
development
of
fire
control
to
a
proficiency
and
strength
of
force
which
will
prevent
as
many
fires
as
possible
and
suppress
fires
before
they
spread
beyond
permitted
standards
.
This
is
to
be
accomplished
by
nearly
doubling
the
present
level
of
preventive
effort
,
detection
,
skilled
fire-fighting
crews
,
and
equipment
use
.
This
will
include
a
stepped-up
program
of
training
and
development
of
personnel
.
2
.
Adoption
and
use
of
new
and
modern
techniques
being
developed
for
prevention
,
for
suppression
of
fires
while
small
,
and
for
stopping
large
fires
while
running
and
burning
intensely
.
3
.
Reduction
of
hazardous
fuel
conditions
to
minimize
the
chances
of
large
fires
developing
and
spreading
to
high-value
areas
.
This
work
will
cover
the
most
serious
one-fourth
of
all
land
needing
such
treatment
,
and
will
consist
of
burning
250,000
acres
of
highly
hazardous
debris
concentration
,
felling
snags
on
350,000
acres
of
high
lightning-occurrence
areas
,
prescribed
burning
on
3.5
million
acres
,
removing
roadside
fuel
on
39,000
acres
,
and
clearing
and
maintaining
11,000
miles
of
firebreaks
.
Protection
from
other
damage
Rodent
control
work
for
the
10-year
period
will
be
aimed
at
control
of
the
most
serious
infestations
of
harmful
rodents
,
such
as
porcupines
and
mice
,
on
high-value
areas
of
forage
and
commercial
timberlands
.
These
areas
comprise
about
half
of
the
total
area
of
rodent
infestation
on
the
National
Forests
.
Approximately
1.8
million
acres
of
rangelands
and
9.4
million
acres
of
timberlands
would
be
treated
in
this
period
.
Control
would
be
limited
to
those
rodents
for
which
economical
means
of
control
are
known
.
Roads
and
trails
The
transportation
system
which
serves
the
National
Forests
is
a
complex
of
highways
and
access
roads
and
trails
under
various
ownerships
and
jurisdictions
.
This
system
is
divided
into
a
forest
highway
system
,
administered
by
the
Secretary
of
Commerce
,
and
a
forest
development
road
and
trail
system
,
administered
by
the
Secretary
of
Agriculture
.
Both
of
these
systems
are
essential
for
the
production
,
development
,
and
use
of
the
National
Forests
.
In
the
forest
highway
system
,
there
are
now
24,400
miles
of
public
roads
.
These
are
mostly
through
highways
that
carry
traffic
going
from
one
destination
to
another
.
Because
administration
of
the
forest
highway
system
is
a
responsibility
of
the
Secretary
of
Commerce
with
maintenance
provided
by
the
States
and
counties
,
this
Development
Program
for
the
National
Forests
does
not
include
estimates
of
the
funds
needed
to
maintain
the
forest
highway
system
nor
to
construct
the
additions
to
it
that
are
needed
.
It
is
estimated
that
about
70,000
miles
of
forest
highways
will
eventually
be
needed
to
fully
serve
the
National
Forests
.
In
the
forest
development
road
and
trail
system
,
there
are
now
162,400
miles
of
roads
and
106,500
miles
of
supplemental
foot
and
horse
trails
.
These
roads
are
largely
of
less
than
highway
standards
,
and
usually
carry
traffic
which
is
related
to
use
of
the
National
Forests
.
Construction
and
maintenance
of
this
system
is
a
responsibility
of
the
Secretary
of
Agriculture
.
It
is
estimated
that
about
542,250
miles
of
forest
development
roads
,
and
80,000
miles
of
trails
,
constitute
the
system
that
will
eventually
be
needed
to
obtain
the
maximum
practicable
yield
and
use
of
the
wood
,
water
,
forage
,
and
wildlife
and
recreation
resources
of
the
National
Forests
on
a
continuing
basis
.
The
ultimate
trail
system
will
be
of
value
primarily
for
recreation
and
wildlife
utilization
and
fire
protection
.
It
will
be
carefully
planned
to
maintain
optimum
service
to
these
important
resources
and
watersheds
.
The
presence
or
lack
of
access
by
road
or
trail
has
a
direct
and
controlling
influence
on
all
phases
of
forest
management
and
utilization
such
as
:
(
A
)
the
protection
of
forage
,
timber
,
and
wildlife
resources
from
fire
,
insects
,
and
disease
;
;
(
B
)
the
balanced
use
of
recreation
,
hunting
,
and
fishing
areas
;
;
(
C
)
the
volume
of
timber
that
can
be
marketed
,
especially
for
small
sales
and
the
support
of
dependent
communities
and
small
business
enterprises
;
;
(
D
)
the
level
of
salvage
cutting
in
dead
and
dying
timber
stands
and
the
opportunity
to
promptly
salvage
losses
resulting
from
fire
,
windstorm
,
insects
,
and
disease
;
;
(
E
)
the
protection
of
watershed
lands
from
erosion
and
overgrazing
by
animals
.
The
existence
of
road
systems
permits
an
intensity
of
management
and
use
for
all
National
Forest
purposes
that
is
not
otherwise
possible
.
Furthermore
,
roads
that
give
access
to
National
Forest
timber
are
investments
which
pay
their
own
way
over
a
period
of
years
.
Use
of
these
roads
by
the
public
results
in
substantial
benefits
to
the
localities
the
roads
serve
.
The
long-range
objective
of
this
Department
is
to
provide
and
maintain
a
system
of
forest
development
roads
and
trails
which
will
adequately
service
the
National
Forest
System
at
the
levels
needed
to
meet
expected
needs
and
optimum
production
of
products
and
services
.
For
the
year
2000
this
means
servicing
(
A
)
the
protection
requirements
of
a
watershed
producing
at
least
200
million
acre-feet
of
water
each
year
,
(
B
)
recreation
and
wildlife
resources
used
each
year
by
635
million
visitors
,
(
C
)
a
timber
resource
supporting
an
annual
cut
of
21
billion
board
feet
,
and
(
D
)
60
million
acres
of
rangelands
.
Service
at
these
levels
of
production
and
utilization
will
eventually
require
the
construction
of
about
379,900
miles
of
new
roads
and
6,000
miles
of
new
trails
,
along
with
the
reconstruction
to
higher
standards
of
about
105,000
miles
of
roads
and
10,500
miles
of
trails
.
About
26,500
miles
of
existing
trails
will
be
replaced
in
service
by
the
construction
of
new
roads
.
About
80
percent
of
these
long-range
requirements
should
be
met
by
the
year
2000
.
Program
proposals
for
forest
development
roads
and
trails
for
the
10-year
period
1963-1972
are
as
follows
:
1
.
Complete
the
construction
and
reconstruction
of
about
79,400
miles
of
multiple-purpose
roads
and
8,000
miles
of
trails
.
This
constitutes
about
17
percent
of
the
long-range
requirements
for
these
facilities
.
Approximately
40
percent
of
the
value
of
the
work
on
roads
for
access
to
timber
which
are
planned
for
this
period
will
be
constructed
by
purchasers
of
National
Forest
timber
,
but
paid
for
by
the
Government
through
adjustment
of
stumpage
prices
.
2
.
Provide
maintenance
to
full
standards
on
the
268,900
miles
of
existing
access
roads
and
trails
and
on
the
new
roads
and
trails
constructed
during
the
period
.
Land
adjustment
,
land
purchase
,
land
use
Within
the
units
in
the
National
Forest
System
the
pattern
of
land
ownership
is
quite
irregular
.
In
some
units
,
National
Forest
ownership
is
well
blocked
together
.
In
many
others
,
the
previous
patenting
of
land
under
the
public
land
laws
,
or
the
way
in
which
land
was
available
for
purchase
,
resulted
in
a
scattered
pattern
of
ownership
.
Within
exterior
boundaries
of
National
Forests
and
National
Grasslands
,
there
are
about
40,000,000
acres
in
non-Federal
ownership
.
One
consequence
is
the
occurrence
of
occasional
conflicts
because
private
owners
of
some
inholdings
object
to
public
programs
of
use
on
neighboring
National
Forest
or
other
Federal
land
,
or
because
such
ownerships
are
developed
for
uses
that
are
not
compatible
with
use
for
the
public
of
neighboring
National
Forest
land
.
Some
privately
held
inholdings
are
a
source
of
direct
damage
to
these
Federal
lands
.
And
some
,
which
are
suitable
for
tree
growing
and
for
other
National
Forest
purposes
,
are
unmanaged
or
in
need
of
expensive
rehabilitation
,
and
are
contributing
nothing
to
the
economy
;
;
there
are
no
reasonable
prospects
that
these
conditions
will
be
corrected
or
changed
.
Lands
in
this
last
category
are
situated
largely
in
the
mountainous
portions
of
the
Eastern
States
.
The
long-range
objective
is
to
bring
about
consolidation
of
ownership
through
use
of
land
exchange
authority
and
through
purchase
on
a
moderate
scale
of
inholdings
which
comprise
key
tracts
for
recognized
National
Forest
programs
such
as
recreation
development
,
or
which
are
a
source
of
damage
to
lands
in
National
Forests
and
National
Grasslands
.
Strategy
and
tactics
of
the
U.S.
military
forces
are
now
undergoing
one
of
the
greatest
transitions
in
history
.
The
change
of
emphasis
from
conventional-type
to
missile-type
warfare
must
be
made
with
care
,
mindful
that
the
one
type
of
warfare
cannot
be
safely
neglected
in
favor
of
the
other
.
Our
military
forces
must
be
capable
of
contending
successfully
with
any
contingency
which
may
be
forced
upon
us
,
from
limited
emergencies
to
all-out
nuclear
general
war
.
Forces
and
military
personnel
strength
.
--
This
budget
will
provide
in
the
fiscal
year
1961
for
the
continued
support
of
our
forces
at
approximately
the
present
level
--
a
year-end
strength
of
2,489,000
men
and
women
in
the
active
forces
.
The
forces
to
be
supported
include
an
Army
of
14
divisions
and
870,000
men
;
;
a
Navy
of
817
active
ships
and
619,000
men
;
;
a
Marine
Corps
of
3
divisions
and
3
air
wings
with
175,000
men
;
;
and
an
Air
Force
of
91
combat
wings
and
825,000
men
.
If
the
reserve
components
are
to
serve
effectively
in
time
of
war
,
their
basic
organization
and
objectives
must
conform
to
the
changing
character
and
missions
of
the
active
forces
.
Quality
and
combat
readiness
must
take
precedence
over
mere
numbers
.
Under
modern
conditions
,
this
is
especially
true
of
the
ready
reserve
.
I
have
requested
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
reexamine
the
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserve
components
in
relation
to
those
of
the
active
forces
and
in
the
light
of
the
changing
requirements
of
modern
warfare
.
Last
year
the
Congress
discontinued
its
previously
imposed
minimum
personnel
strength
limitations
on
the
Army
Reserve
.
Similar
restrictions
on
the
strength
of
the
Army
National
Guard
contained
in
the
1960
Department
of
Defense
Appropriation
Act
should
likewise
be
dropped
.
I
strongly
recommend
to
the
Congress
the
avoidance
of
mandatory
floors
on
the
size
of
the
reserve
components
so
that
we
may
have
the
flexibility
to
make
adjustments
in
keeping
with
military
necessity
.
I
again
proposed
a
reduction
in
the
Army
National
Guard
and
Army
Reserve
--
from
their
present
strengths
of
400,000
and
300,000
,
respectively
,
to
360,000
and
270,000
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
1961
.
These
strengths
are
considered
adequate
to
meet
the
essential
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserves
in
support
of
our
national
security
objectives
.
Military
personnel
costs
.
--
About
30%
of
the
expenditures
for
the
Department
of
Defense
in
1961
are
for
military
personnel
costs
,
including
pay
for
active
,
reserve
,
and
retired
military
personnel
.
These
expenditures
are
estimated
to
be
$12.1
billion
,
an
increase
of
$187
million
over
1960
,
reflecting
additional
longevity
pay
of
career
personnel
,
more
dependents
,
an
increased
number
of
men
drawing
proficiency
pay
,
and
social
security
tax
increases
(
effective
for
the
full
year
in
1961
compared
with
only
6
months
in
1960
)
.
Retired
pay
costs
are
increased
by
$94
million
in
1961
over
1960
,
partly
because
of
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
retired
personnel
.
These
increased
costs
are
partially
offset
by
a
decrease
of
$56
million
in
expenditures
for
the
reserve
forces
,
largely
because
of
the
planned
reduction
in
strength
of
the
Army
Reserve
components
during
1961
.
Traditionally
,
rates
of
pay
for
retired
military
personnel
have
been
proportionate
to
current
rates
of
pay
for
active
personnel
.
The
1958
military
pay
act
departed
from
this
established
formula
by
providing
for
a
6%
increase
rather
than
a
proportionate
increase
for
everyone
retired
prior
to
its
effective
date
of
June
1
,
1958
.
I
endorse
pending
legislation
that
will
restore
the
traditional
relationship
between
retired
and
active
duty
pay
rates
.
Operation
and
maintenance
.
--
Expenditures
for
operating
and
maintaining
the
stations
and
equipment
of
the
Armed
Forces
are
estimated
to
be
$10.3
billion
in
1961
,
which
is
$184
million
more
than
in
1960
.
The
increase
stems
largely
from
the
growing
complexity
of
and
higher
degree
of
maintenance
required
for
newer
weapons
and
equipment
.
A
substantial
increase
is
estimated
in
the
cost
of
operating
additional
communications
systems
in
the
air
defense
program
,
as
well
as
in
all
programs
where
speed
and
security
of
communications
are
essential
.
Also
,
the
program
for
fleet
modernization
will
be
stepped
up
in
1961
causing
an
increase
in
expenditures
.
Further
increases
arise
from
the
civilian
employee
health
program
enacted
by
the
Congress
last
year
.
Other
factors
increasing
operating
costs
include
the
higher
unit
cost
of
each
flying
hour
,
up
11%
in
two
years
,
and
of
each
steaming
hour
,
up
15%
.
In
total
,
these
increases
in
operating
costs
outweigh
the
savings
that
result
from
declining
programs
and
from
economy
measures
,
such
as
reduced
numbers
of
units
and
installations
,
smaller
inventories
of
major
equipment
,
and
improvements
in
the
supply
and
distribution
systems
of
the
Armed
Forces
.
In
the
budget
message
for
1959
,
and
again
for
1960
,
I
recommended
immediate
repeal
of
section
601
of
the
Act
of
September
28
,
1951
(
65
Stat.
365
)
.
This
section
prevents
the
military
departments
and
the
Office
of
Civil
and
Defense
Mobilization
from
carrying
out
certain
transactions
involving
real
property
unless
they
come
into
agreement
with
the
Committees
on
Armed
Services
of
the
Senate
and
the
House
of
Representatives
.
As
I
have
stated
previously
,
the
Attorney
General
has
advised
me
that
this
section
violates
fundamental
constitutional
principles
.
Accordingly
,
if
it
is
not
repealed
by
the
Congress
at
its
present
session
,
I
shall
have
no
alternative
thereafter
but
to
direct
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
disregard
the
section
unless
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
determines
otherwise
.
Basic
long-line
communications
in
Alaska
are
now
provided
through
Federal
facilities
operated
by
the
Army
,
Air
Force
,
and
Federal
Aviation
Agency
.
The
growing
communications
needs
of
this
new
State
can
best
be
met
,
as
they
have
in
other
States
,
through
the
operation
and
development
of
such
facilities
by
private
enterprise
.
Legislation
has
already
been
proposed
to
authorize
the
sale
of
these
Government-owned
systems
in
Alaska
,
and
its
early
enactment
is
desirable
.
Procurement
,
research
,
and
construction
.
--
Approximately
45%
of
the
expenditures
for
the
Department
of
Defense
are
for
procurement
,
research
,
development
,
and
construction
programs
.
In
1961
,
these
expenditures
are
estimated
at
$18.9
billion
,
compared
to
$19.3
billion
in
1960
.
The
decreases
,
which
are
largely
in
construction
and
in
aircraft
procurement
,
are
offset
in
part
by
increases
for
research
and
development
and
for
procurement
of
other
military
equipment
such
as
tanks
,
vehicles
,
guns
,
and
electronic
devices
.
Expenditures
for
shipbuilding
are
estimated
at
about
the
same
level
as
in
1960
.
New
obligational
authority
for
1961
recommended
in
this
budget
for
aircraft
procurement
(
excluding
amounts
for
related
research
and
construction
)
totals
$4,753
million
,
which
is
$1,390
million
below
that
enacted
for
1960
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
new
authority
of
$3,825
million
proposed
for
missile
procurement
(
excluding
research
and
construction
)
in
1961
is
$581
million
higher
than
for
1960
.
These
contrasting
trends
in
procurement
reflect
the
anticipated
changes
in
the
composition
and
missions
of
our
Armed
Forces
in
the
years
ahead
.
The
Department
of
Defense
appropriation
acts
for
the
past
several
years
have
contained
a
rider
which
limits
competitive
bidding
by
firms
in
other
countries
on
certain
military
supply
items
.
As
I
have
repeatedly
stated
,
this
provision
is
much
more
restrictive
than
the
general
law
,
popularly
known
as
the
Buy
American
Act
.
I
urge
once
again
that
the
Congress
not
reenact
this
rider
.
The
task
of
providing
a
reasonable
level
of
military
strength
,
without
endangering
other
vital
aspects
of
our
security
,
is
greatly
complicated
by
the
swift
pace
of
scientific
progress
.
The
last
few
years
have
witnessed
what
have
been
perhaps
the
most
rapid
advances
in
military
technology
in
history
.
Some
weapons
systems
have
become
obsolescent
while
still
in
production
,
and
some
while
still
under
development
.
Furthermore
,
unexpectedly
rapid
progress
or
a
technological
break-through
on
any
one
weapon
system
,
in
itself
,
often
diminishes
the
relative
importance
of
other
competitive
systems
.
This
has
necessitated
a
continuous
review
and
reevaluation
of
the
defense
program
in
order
to
redirect
resources
to
the
newer
and
more
important
weapons
systems
and
to
eliminate
or
reduce
effort
on
weapons
systems
which
have
been
overtaken
by
events
.
Thus
,
in
the
last
few
years
,
a
number
of
programs
which
looked
very
promising
at
the
time
their
development
was
commenced
have
since
been
completely
eliminated
.
For
example
,
the
importance
of
the
Regulus
2
,
a
very
promising
aerodynamic
ship-to-surface
missile
designed
to
be
launched
by
surfaced
submarines
,
was
greatly
diminished
by
the
successful
acceleration
of
the
much
more
advanced
Polaris
ballistic
missile
launched
by
submerged
submarines
.
Another
example
is
the
recent
cancellation
of
the
F-108
,
a
long-range
interceptor
with
a
speed
three
times
as
great
as
the
speed
of
sound
,
which
was
designed
for
use
against
manned
bombers
in
the
period
of
the
mid-1960's
.
The
substantial
progress
being
made
in
ballistic
missile
technology
is
rapidly
shifting
the
main
threat
from
manned
bombers
to
missiles
.
Considering
the
high
cost
of
the
F-108
system
--
over
$4
billion
for
the
force
that
had
been
planned
--
and
the
time
period
in
which
it
would
become
operational
,
it
was
decided
to
stop
further
work
on
the
project
.
Meanwhile
,
other
air
defense
forces
are
being
made
effective
,
as
described
later
in
this
message
.
The
size
and
scope
of
other
important
programs
have
been
reduced
from
earlier
plans
.
Notable
in
this
category
are
the
Jupiter
and
Thor
intermediate
range
ballistic
missiles
,
which
have
been
successfully
developed
,
produced
,
and
deployed
,
but
the
relative
importance
of
which
has
diminished
with
the
increasing
availability
of
the
Atlas
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
.
The
impact
of
technological
factors
is
also
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
high-energy
fuel
program
.
This
project
was
started
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
critical
need
for
a
high-energy
fuel
to
provide
an
extra
margin
of
range
for
high
performance
aircraft
,
particularly
our
heavy
bombers
.
Continuing
technical
problems
involved
in
the
use
of
this
fuel
,
coupled
with
significant
improvements
in
aircraft
range
through
other
means
,
have
now
raised
serious
questions
about
the
value
of
the
high-energy
fuel
program
.
As
a
result
,
the
scope
of
this
project
has
been
sharply
curtailed
.
These
examples
underscore
the
importance
of
even
more
searching
evaluations
of
new
major
development
programs
and
even
more
penetrating
and
far-ranging
analyses
of
the
potentialities
of
future
technology
.
The
cost
of
developing
a
major
weapon
system
is
now
so
enormous
that
the
greatest
care
must
be
exercised
in
selecting
new
systems
for
development
,
in
determining
the
most
satisfactory
rate
of
development
,
and
in
deciding
the
proper
time
at
which
either
to
place
a
system
into
production
or
to
abandon
it
.
Strategic
forces
.
--
The
deterrent
power
of
our
Armed
Forces
comes
from
both
their
nuclear
retaliatory
capability
and
their
capability
to
conduct
other
essential
operations
in
any
form
of
war
.
The
first
capability
is
represented
by
a
combination
of
manned
bombers
,
carrier-based
aircraft
,
and
intercontinental
and
intermediate
range
missiles
.
The
second
capability
is
represented
by
our
deployed
ground
,
naval
,
and
air
forces
in
essential
forward
areas
,
together
with
ready
reserves
capable
of
effecting
early
emergency
reinforcement
.
The
Strategic
Air
Command
is
the
principal
element
of
our
long-range
nuclear
capability
.
One
of
the
important
and
difficult
decisions
which
had
to
be
made
in
this
budget
concerned
the
role
of
the
B-70
,
a
long-range
supersonic
bomber
.
This
aircraft
,
which
was
planned
for
initial
operational
use
about
1965
,
would
be
complementary
to
but
likewise
competitive
with
the
four
strategic
ballistic
missile
systems
,
all
of
which
are
scheduled
to
become
available
earlier
.
The
first
Atlas
ICBM's
are
now
operational
,
the
first
two
Polaris
submarines
are
expected
to
be
operational
this
calendar
year
,
and
the
first
Titan
ICBM's
next
year
.
The
Minuteman
solid-fueled
ICBM
is
planned
to
be
operational
about
mid-1963
.
By
1965
,
several
or
all
of
these
systems
will
have
been
fully
tested
and
their
reliability
established
.
Thus
,
the
need
for
the
B-70
as
a
strategic
weapon
system
is
doubtful
.
However
,
I
am
recommending
that
development
work
on
the
B-70
air-frame
and
engines
be
continued
.
It
is
expected
that
in
1963
two
prototype
aircraft
will
be
available
for
flight
testing
.
By
that
time
we
should
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
the
value
of
that
aircraft
as
a
weapon
system
.
I
am
recommending
additional
acquisitions
of
the
improved
version
of
the
B-52
(
the
B-52H
with
the
new
turbofan
engine
