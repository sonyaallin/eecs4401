It
was
on
the
eve
of
a
momentous
U.N.
session
to
come
to
grips
with
cold
war
issues
.
His
firm
hand
will
be
desperately
missed
.
Mr.
Hammarskjold
was
in
Africa
on
a
mission
of
peace
.
He
had
sought
talks
with
Moise
Tshombe
,
the
secessionist
president
of
Congo's
Katanga
province
where
recent
fighting
had
been
bloody
.
He
earnestly
urged
a
cease-fire
.
The
story
of
the
fatal
crash
is
not
fully
known
.
The
U.N.-chartered
plane
which
was
flying
from
the
conference
city
of
Ndola
in
Northern
Rhodesia
had
been
riddled
with
machinegun
bullets
last
weekend
and
was
newly
repaired
.
Whether
this
,
or
overt
action
,
was
the
cause
of
the
crash
must
be
promptly
determined
.
The
death
of
Mr.
Hammarskjold
removes
the
United
Nations'
most
controversial
leader
.
He
was
controversial
because
he
was
uncompromising
for
peace
and
freedom
with
justice
.
He
courageously
defended
the
rights
of
small
nations
,
and
he
stood
his
ground
against
the
savage
attacks
of
the
Communist
bloc
.
The
Congo
,
in
whose
cause
he
died
,
was
the
scene
of
one
of
his
greatest
triumphs
.
His
policies
had
resolved
the
conflicts
that
threatened
to
ignite
the
cold
war
and
workable
solutions
were
beginning
to
take
shape
.
When
the
recent
Katangan
outbreaks
imperiled
these
solutions
Mr.
Hammarskjold
,
despite
the
danger
,
flew
to
exert
a
calming
influence
.
He
gave
his
life
for
his
beliefs
.
The
U.N.
session
scheduled
for
today
will
meet
under
the
cloud
of
his
passing
.
It
is
a
crucial
session
with
the
world
on
the
edge
of
momentous
developments
.
If
the
manner
of
his
passing
moves
the
nations
to
act
in
the
spirit
of
his
dedication
the
sore
issues
that
plague
the
world
can
yet
be
resolved
with
reason
and
justice
.
That
is
the
hope
of
mankind
.
Monument
to
togetherness
reaching
agreement
on
projects
of
value
to
the
whole
community
has
long
been
one
of
Greater
Miami's
hardest
tasks
.
Too
many
have
bogged
down
in
bickering
.
Even
when
public
bodies
arrived
at
a
consensus
,
at
least
one
dissenting
vote
has
been
usual
.
So
we
note
approvingly
a
fresh
sample
of
unanimity
.
All
nine
members
of
the
Inter-American
Center
Authority
voted
for
Goodbody
&
Company's
proposal
to
finance
the
long-awaited
trade
and
cultural
center
.
The
widely
known
financial
firm
has
60
days
to
spell
out
the
terms
of
its
contract
.
