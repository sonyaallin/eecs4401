They
,
too
,
have
links
with
the
city's
ills
.
Both
men
are
known
to
be
honest
and
public-spirited
.
Mayor
Wagner's
shortcomings
have
perhaps
been
more
mercilessly
exposed
than
those
of
Mr.
Levitt
who
left
an
impression
of
quiet
competence
in
his
more
protected
state
post
.
As
Mayor
,
Mr.
Levitt
might
turn
out
to
be
more
independent
than
some
of
his
leading
supporters
would
like
.
His
election
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
unquestionably
strengthen
the
``
regulars
''
.
Mr.
Wagner
might
or
might
not
be
a
``
new
''
Mayor
in
this
third
term
,
now
that
he
is
free
of
the
pressure
of
those
party
leaders
whom
he
calls
``
bosses
''
.
These
are
,
of
course
,
the
same
people
whose
support
he
has
only
now
rejected
to
seek
the
independent
vote
.
But
his
reelection
would
strengthen
the
liberal
Democrats
and
the
labor
unions
who
back
him
.
If
this
choice
is
less
exciting
than
New
York
Democrats
may
wish
,
it
nevertheless
must
be
made
.
The
vote
still
gives
citizens
a
voice
in
the
operation
of
their
government
and
their
party
.
Little
war
,
big
test
Both
Mr.
K's
have
so
far
continued
to
speak
softly
and
carry
big
sticks
over
Laos
.
President
Kennedy
,
already
two
quiet
demands
down
,
still
refused
Thursday
to
be
drawn
into
delivering
a
public
ultimatum
to
Moscow
.
But
at
the
same
time
he
moved
his
helicopter-borne
marines
to
within
an
hour
of
the
fighting
.
And
Secretary
Rusk
,
en
route
to
Bangkok
,
doubtless
is
trying
to
make
emergency
arrangements
for
the
possible
entry
of
Australian
or
Thai
SEATO
forces
.
For
Mr.
Kennedy
,
speaking
softly
and
carrying
a
sizable
stick
is
making
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
.
The
new
President
is
in
no
position
to
start
out
his
dealings
with
Moscow
by
issuing
callable
bluffs
.
He
must
show
at
the
outset
that
he
means
exactly
what
he
says
.
In
this
case
he
has
put
the
alternatives
clearly
to
Mr.
Khrushchev
for
the
third
time
.
At
his
press
conference
Mr.
Kennedy
said
,
``
All
we
want
in
Laos
is
peace
not
war
a
truly
neutral
government
not
a
cold
war
pawn
''
.
At
the
scene
he
has
just
as
clearly
shown
his
military
strength
in
unprovocative
but
ready
position
.
