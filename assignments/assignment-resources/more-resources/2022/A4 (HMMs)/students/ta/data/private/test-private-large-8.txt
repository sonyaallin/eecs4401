The
future
would
happen
;
;
he
did
not
have
to
hurry
it
by
thinking
too
much
.
A
man
could
be
tossed
outside
the
dimension
of
time
by
a
stray
bullet
these
days
.
He
began
to
pack
the
saddlebags
.
And
all
this
too
shall
pass
away
:
it
came
to
him
out
of
some
dim
corner
of
memory
from
a
church
service
when
he
was
a
boy
--
yes
,
in
a
white
church
with
a
thin
spur
steeple
in
the
patriarchal
Hudson
Valley
,
where
a
feeling
of
plenitude
was
normal
in
those
English-Dutch
manors
with
their
well-fed
squires
.
Burly
leathered
men
and
wrinkled
women
in
drab
black
rags
carried
on
in
a
primitive
way
,
almost
unchanged
from
feudal
times
.
Peasants
puzzled
Andrei
.
He
wondered
how
they
could
go
on
in
poverty
,
superstition
,
ignorance
,
with
a
complete
lack
of
desire
to
make
either
their
land
or
their
lives
flourish
.
Andrei
remembered
a
Bathyran
meeting
long
ago
.
Tolek
Alterman
had
returned
from
the
colonies
in
Palestine
and
,
before
the
national
leadership
,
exalted
the
miracles
of
drying
up
swamps
and
irrigating
the
desert
.
A
fund-raising
drive
to
buy
tractors
and
machinery
was
launched
.
Andrei
remembered
that
his
own
reaction
had
been
one
of
indifference
.
Had
he
found
the
meaning
too
late
?
?
It
aggravated
him
.
The
land
of
the
Lublin
Uplands
was
rich
,
but
no
one
seemed
to
care
.
In
the
unfertile
land
in
Palestine
humans
broke
their
backs
pushing
will
power
to
the
brink
.
He
had
sat
beside
Alexander
Brandel
at
the
rostrum
of
a
congress
of
Zionists
.
All
of
them
were
there
in
this
loosely
knit
association
of
diversified
ideologies
,
and
each
berated
the
other
and
beat
his
breast
for
his
own
approaches
.
When
Alexander
Brandel
rose
to
speak
,
the
hall
became
silent
.
``
I
do
not
care
if
your
beliefs
take
you
along
a
path
of
religion
or
a
path
of
labor
or
a
path
of
activism
.
We
are
here
because
all
our
paths
travel
a
blind
course
through
a
thick
forest
,
seeking
human
dignity
.
Beyond
the
forest
all
our
paths
merge
into
a
single
great
highway
which
ends
in
the
barren
,
eroded
hills
of
Judea
.
This
is
our
singular
goal
.
How
we
travel
through
the
forest
is
for
each
man's
conscience
.
Where
we
end
our
journey
is
always
the
same
.
We
all
seek
the
same
thing
through
different
ways
--
an
end
to
this
long
night
of
two
thousand
years
of
darkness
and
unspeakable
abuses
which
will
continue
to
plague
us
until
the
Star
of
David
flies
over
Zion
''
.
This
was
how
Alexander
Brandel
expressed
pure
Zionism
.
It
had
sounded
good
to
Andrei
,
but
he
did
not
believe
it
.
In
his
heart
he
had
no
desire
to
go
to
Palestine
.
He
loathed
the
idea
of
drying
up
swamps
or
the
chills
of
malaria
or
of
leaving
his
natural
birthright
.
Before
he
went
into
battle
Andrei
had
told
Alex
,
``
I
only
want
to
be
a
Pole
.
Warsaw
is
my
city
,
not
Tel
Aviv
''
.
And
now
Andrei
sat
on
a
train
on
the
way
to
Lublin
and
wondered
if
he
was
not
being
punished
for
his
lack
of
belief
.
Warsaw
!
!
He
saw
the
smug
eyes
of
the
Home
Army
chief
,
Roman
,
and
all
the
Romans
and
the
faces
of
the
peasants
who
held
only
hatred
for
him
.
They
had
let
this
black
hole
of
death
in
Warsaw's
heart
exist
without
a
cry
of
protest
.
Once
there
had
been
big
glittering
rooms
where
Ulanys
bowed
and
kissed
the
ladies'
hands
as
they
flirted
from
behind
their
fans
.
Warsaw
!
!
Warsaw
!
!
``
Miss
Rak
.
I
am
a
Jew
''
.
Day
by
day
,
week
by
week
,
month
by
month
,
the
betrayal
gnawed
at
Andrei's
heart
.
He
ground
his
teeth
together
.
I
hate
Warsaw
,
he
said
to
himself
.
I
hate
Poland
and
all
the
goddamned
mothers'
sons
of
them
.
All
of
Poland
is
a
coffin
.
The
terrible
vision
of
the
ghetto
streets
flooded
his
mind
.
What
matters
now
?
?
What
is
beyond
this
fog
?
?
Only
Palestine
,
and
I
will
never
live
to
see
Palestine
because
I
did
not
believe
.
By
late
afternoon
the
train
inched
into
the
marshaling
yards
in
the
railhead
at
Lublin
,
which
was
filled
with
lines
of
cars
poised
to
pour
the
tools
of
war
to
the
Russian
front
.
At
a
siding
,
another
train
which
was
a
familiar
sight
these
days
.
Deportees
.
Jews
.
Andrei's
skilled
eye
sized
them
up
.
They
were
not
Poles
.
He
guessed
by
their
appearance
that
they
were
Rumanians
.
He
walked
toward
the
center
of
the
city
to
keep
his
rendezvous
with
Styka
.
Of
all
the
places
in
Poland
,
Andrei
hated
Lublin
the
most
.
The
Bathyrans
were
all
gone
.
Few
of
the
native
Jews
who
had
lived
in
Lublin
were
still
in
the
ghetto
.
From
the
moment
of
the
occupation
Lublin
became
a
focal
point
.
He
and
Ana
watched
it
carefully
.
Lublin
generally
was
the
forerunner
of
what
would
happen
elsewhere
.
Early
in
1939
,
Odilo
Globocnik
,
the
Gauleiter
of
Vienna
,
established
SS
headquarters
for
all
of
Poland
.
The
Bathyrans
ran
a
check
on
Globocnik
and
had
only
to
conclude
that
he
was
in
a
tug
of
war
with
Hans
Frank
and
the
civilian
administrators
.
Globocnik
built
the
Death's-Head
Corps
.
Lublin
was
the
seed
of
action
for
the
``
final
solution
''
of
the
Jewish
problem
.
As
the
messages
from
Himmler
,
Heydrich
,
and
Eichmann
came
in
through
Alfred
Funk
,
Lublin's
fountainhead
spouted
.
A
bevy
of
interlacing
lagers
,
work
camps
,
concentration
camps
erupted
in
the
area
.
Sixty
thousand
Jewish
prisoners
of
war
disappeared
into
Lublin's
web
.
Plans
went
in
and
out
of
Lublin
,
indicating
German
confusion
.
A
tale
of
a
massive
reservation
in
the
Uplands
to
hold
several
million
Jews
A
tale
of
a
plan
to
ship
all
Jews
to
the
island
of
Madagascar
Stories
of
the
depravity
of
the
guards
at
Globocnik's
camps
struck
a
chord
of
terror
at
the
mere
mention
of
their
names
.
Lipowa
7
,
Sobibor
,
Chelmno
,
Poltawa
,
Belzec
,
Krzywy-Rog
,
Budzyn
,
Krasnik
.
Ice
baths
,
electric
shocks
,
lashings
,
wild
dogs
,
testicle
crushers
.
The
Death's-Head
Corps
took
in
Ukrainian
and
Baltic
Auxiliaries
,
and
the
Einsatzkommandos
waded
knee-deep
in
blood
and
turned
into
drunken
,
dope-ridden
maniacs
.
Lublin
was
their
heart
.
In
the
spring
of
1942
Operation
Reinhard
began
in
Lublin
.
The
ghetto
,
a
miniature
of
Warsaw's
,
was
emptied
into
the
camp
in
the
Majdan-Tartarski
suburb
called
Majdanek
.
As
the
camp
emptied
,
it
was
refilled
by
a
draining
of
the
camps
and
towns
around
Lublin
,
then
by
deportees
from
outside
Poland
.
In
and
in
and
in
they
poured
through
the
gates
of
Majdanek
,
but
they
never
left
,
and
Majdanek
was
not
growing
any
larger
.
What
was
happening
in
Majdanek
?
?
Was
Operation
Reinhard
the
same
pattern
for
the
daily
trains
now
leaving
the
Umschlagplatz
in
Warsaw
?
?
Was
there
another
Majdanek
in
the
Warsaw
area
,
as
they
suspected
?
?
Andrei
stopped
at
Litowski
Place
and
looked
around
quickly
at
the
boundary
of
civil
buildings
.
His
watch
told
him
he
was
still
early
.
Down
the
boulevard
he
could
see
a
portion
of
the
ghetto
wall
.
He
found
an
empty
bench
,
opened
a
newspaper
,
and
stretched
his
legs
before
him
.
Krakow
Boulevard
was
filled
with
black
Nazi
uniforms
and
the
dirty
brownish
ones
of
their
Auxiliaries
.
``
Captain
Androfski
''
!
!
Andrei
glanced
up
over
the
top
of
the
paper
and
looked
into
the
mustached
,
homely
face
of
Sergeant
Styka
.
Styka
sat
beside
him
and
pumped
his
hand
excitedly
.
``
I
have
been
waiting
across
the
street
at
the
post
office
since
dawn
.
I
thought
you
might
get
in
on
a
morning
train
''
.
``
It's
good
to
see
you
again
,
Styka
''
.
Styka
studied
his
captain
.
He
almost
broke
into
tears
.
To
him
,
Andrei
Androfski
had
always
been
the
living
symbol
of
a
Polish
officer
.
His
captain
was
thin
and
haggard
and
his
beautiful
boots
were
worn
and
shabby
.
``
Remember
to
call
me
Jan
''
,
Andrei
said
.
Styka
nodded
and
sniffed
and
blew
his
nose
vociferously
.
``
When
that
woman
found
me
and
told
me
that
you
needed
me
I
was
never
so
happy
since
before
the
war
''
.
``
I'm
lucky
that
you
were
still
living
in
Lublin
''
.
Styka
grumbled
about
fate
.
``
For
a
time
I
thought
of
trying
to
reach
the
Free
Polish
Forces
,
but
one
thing
led
to
another
.
I
got
a
girl
in
trouble
and
we
had
to
get
married
.
Not
a
bad
girl
.
So
we
have
three
children
and
responsibilities
.
I
work
at
the
granary
.
Nothing
like
the
old
days
in
the
army
,
but
I
get
by
.
Who
complains
?
?
Many
times
I
tried
to
reach
you
,
but
I
never
knew
how
.
I
came
to
Warsaw
twice
,
but
there
was
that
damned
ghetto
wall
''
``
I
understand
''
.
Styka
blew
his
nose
again
.
``
Were
you
able
to
make
the
arrangements
''
?
?
Andrei
asked
.
``
There
is
a
man
named
Grabski
who
is
the
foreman
in
charge
of
the
bricklayers
at
Majdanek
.
I
did
exactly
as
instructed
.
I
told
him
you
are
on
orders
from
the
Home
Army
to
get
inside
Majdanek
so
you
can
make
a
report
to
the
government
in
exile
in
London
''
.
``
His
answer
''
?
?
``
Ten
thousand
zlotys
''
.
``
Can
he
be
trusted
''
?
?
``
He
is
aware
he
will
not
live
for
twenty-four
hours
if
he
betrays
you
''
.
``
Good
man
,
Styka
''
.
``
Captain
Jan
must
you
go
inside
Majdanek
?
?
The
stories
Everyone
really
knows
what
is
happening
there
''
.
``
Not
everyone
,
Styka
''
.
``
What
good
will
it
really
do
''
?
?
``
I
don't
know
.
Perhaps
perhaps
there
is
a
shred
of
conscience
left
in
the
human
race
.
Perhaps
if
they
know
the
story
there
will
be
a
massive
cry
of
indignation
''
.
``
Do
you
really
believe
that
,
Jan
''
?
?
``
I
have
to
believe
it
''
.
Styka
shook
his
head
slowly
.
``
I
am
only
a
simple
soldier
.
I
cannot
think
things
out
too
well
.
Until
I
was
transferred
into
the
Seventh
Ulanys
I
was
like
every
other
Pole
in
my
feeling
about
Jews
.
I
hated
you
when
I
first
came
in
.
But
my
captain
might
have
been
a
Jew
,
but
he
wasn't
a
Jew
.
What
I
mean
is
,
he
was
a
Pole
and
the
greatest
soldier
in
the
Ulanys
.
Hell
,
sir
.
The
men
of
our
company
had
a
dozen
fights
defending
your
name
.
You
never
knew
about
it
,
but
by
God
,
we
taught
them
respect
for
Captain
Androfski
''
.
Andrei
smiled
.
``
Since
the
war
I
have
seen
the
way
the
Germans
have
behaved
and
I
think
,
Holy
Mother
,
we
have
behaved
like
this
for
hundreds
of
years
.
Why
''
?
?
``
How
can
you
tell
an
insane
man
to
reason
or
a
blind
man
to
see
''
?
?
``
But
we
are
neither
blind
nor
insane
.
The
men
of
your
company
would
not
allow
your
name
dishonored
.
Why
do
we
let
the
Germans
do
this
''
?
?
``
I
have
sat
many
hours
with
this
,
Styka
.
All
I
ever
wanted
was
to
be
a
free
man
in
my
own
country
.
I've
lost
faith
,
Styka
.
I
used
to
love
this
country
and
believe
that
someday
we'd
win
our
battle
for
equality
.
But
now
I
think
I
hate
it
very
much
''
.
``
And
do
you
really
think
that
the
world
outside
Poland
will
care
any
more
than
we
do
''
?
?
The
question
frightened
Andrei
.
``
Please
don't
go
inside
Majdanek
''
.
``
I'm
still
a
soldier
in
a
very
small
way
,
Styka
''
.
It
was
an
answer
that
Styka
understood
.
Grabski's
shanty
was
beyond
the
bridge
over
the
River
Bystrzyca
near
the
rail
center
.
Grabski
sat
in
a
sweat-saturated
undershirt
,
cursing
the
excessive
heat
which
clamped
an
uneasy
stillness
before
sundown
.
He
was
a
square
brick
of
a
man
with
a
moon-round
face
and
sunken
Polish
features
.
Flies
swarmed
around
the
bowl
of
lentils
in
which
he
mopped
thick
black
bread
.
Half
of
it
dripped
down
his
chin
.
He
washed
it
down
with
beer
and
produced
a
deep-seated
belch
.
``
Well
''
?
?
Andrei
demanded
.
Grabski
looked
at
the
pair
of
them
.
He
grunted
a
sort
of
``
yes
''
answer
.
``
My
cousin
works
at
the
Labor
Bureau
.
He
can
make
you
work
papers
.
It
will
take
a
few
days
.
I
will
get
you
inside
the
guard
camp
as
a
member
of
my
crew
.
I
don't
know
if
I
can
get
you
into
the
inner
camp
.
Maybe
yes
,
maybe
no
,
but
you
can
observe
everything
from
the
roof
of
a
barrack
we
are
building
''
.
Grabski
slurped
his
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
soup
bowl
.
``
Can't
understand
why
the
hell
anyone
wants
to
go
inside
that
son-of-a-bitch
place
''
.
``
Orders
from
the
Home
Army
''
.
``
Why
?
?
Nothing
there
but
Jews
''
.
Andrei
shrugged
.
``
We
get
strange
orders
''
.
``
Well
--
what
about
the
money
''
?
?
Andrei
peeled
off
five
one-thousand-zloty
notes
.
Grabski
had
never
seen
so
much
money
.
His
broad
flat
fingers
,
petrified
into
massive
sausages
by
years
of
bricklaying
,
snatched
the
bills
clumsily
.
``
This
ain't
enough
''
.
``
You
get
the
rest
when
I'm
safely
out
of
Majdanek
''
.
``
I
ain't
taking
no
goddamned
chances
for
no
Jew
business
''
.
Andrei
and
Styka
were
silent
.
She
was
getting
real
dramatic
.
I'd
have
been
more
impressed
if
I
hadn't
remembered
that
she'd
played
Hedda
Gabler
in
her
highschool
dramatics
course
.
I
didn't
want
her
back
on
that
broken
record
.
``
Nothing's
free
in
the
whole
goddam
world
''
,
was
all
I
could
think
of
to
say
.
When
I'd
delivered
myself
of
that
gem
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
order
up
another
drink
.
``
I
am
''
,
she
said
.
I'd
forgotten
all
about
Thelma
and
the
Kentucky
Derby
and
how
it
was
Thelma's
fifty
dollars
I
was
spending
.
It
was
just
me
and
Eileen
getting
drunk
together
like
we
used
to
in
the
old
days
,
and
me
staring
at
her
across
the
table
crazy
to
get
my
hands
on
her
partly
because
I
wanted
to
wring
her
neck
because
she
was
so
ornery
but
mostly
because
she
was
so
wonderful
to
touch
.
Drunk
or
sober
she
was
the
most
attractive
woman
in
the
world
for
me
.
I
was
crazy
about
her
all
over
again
.
It
was
the
call
of
the
wild
all
right
.
That
evening
turned
out
to
be
hell
like
all
the
others
.
We
moved
down
Broadway
from
ginmill
to
ginmill
.
It
was
the
same
old
routine
.
Eileen
got
to
dancing
,
just
a
little
tiny
dancing
step
to
a
hummed
tune
that
you
could
hardly
notice
,
and
trying
to
pick
up
strange
men
,
but
each
time
I
was
ready
to
say
to
hell
with
it
and
walk
out
she'd
pull
herself
together
and
talk
so
understandingly
in
that
sweet
husky
voice
about
the
good
times
and
the
happiness
we'd
had
together
and
there
I
was
back
on
the
hook
.
I
did
have
the
decency
to
call
up
Thelma
and
tell
her
I'd
met
old
friends
and
would
be
home
late
.
``
I
could
scratch
her
eyes
out
''
,
Eileen
cried
and
stamped
her
foot
when
I
came
back
from
the
phone
booth
.
``
You
know
I
don't
like
my
men
to
have
other
women
.
I
hate
it
.
I
hate
it
''
.
She
got
so
drunk
I
had
to
take
her
home
.
It
was
a
walk
up
on
Hudson
Street
.
She
just
about
made
me
carry
her
upstairs
and
then
she
clung
to
me
and
wouldn't
let
me
go
.
There
was
a
man's
jacket
on
the
chair
and
a
straw
hat
on
the
table
.
The
place
smelt
of
some
kind
of
hair
lotion
these
pimplike
characters
use
.
``
What
about
Ballestre
''
?
?
I
had
to
shake
her
to
make
her
listen
.
``
Precious
.
What
about
him
''
?
?
Suddenly
she
was
very
mysterious
and
dramatic
.
``
Precious
and
I
allow
each
other
absolute
freedom
.
We
are
above
being
jealous
.
He's
used
to
me
bringing
home
strange
men
.
I'll
just
tell
him
you're
my
husband
.
He
can't
object
to
that
''
.
``
Well
I
object
.
If
he
pokes
his
nose
in
here
I'll
slug
him
''
.
``
That
really
would
be
funny
''
.
She
began
to
laugh
.
She
was
still
laughing
when
I
grabbed
her
and
started
rolling
her
on
the
bed
.
After
all
I'm
made
of
flesh
and
blood
.
I'm
not
a
plaster
saint
.
Waking
up
was
horrible
.
Never
in
my
life
have
I
felt
so
remorseful
about
anything
I've
done
as
I
did
about
spending
that
night
with
my
own
wife
.
We
both
had
hangovers
.
Eileen
declared
she
couldn't
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
.
She
lay
under
the
covers
making
jabbing
motions
with
her
forefinger
telling
me
where
to
look
for
the
coffeepot
.
I
was
stumbling
in
my
undershirt
trying
to
find
my
way
around
her
damn
kitchenette
when
I
smelt
that
sickish
sweet
hairtonic
smell
.
There
was
somebody
else
in
the
apartment
.
I
stiffened
.
Honest
I
could
feel
the
hair
stand
up
on
the
back
of
my
neck
like
a
dog's
that
is
going
to
get
into
a
fight
.
I
turned
around
with
the
percolator
in
my
hand
.
My
eyes
were
so
bleary
I
could
barely
see
him
but
there
he
was
,
a
little
smooth
olivefaced
guy
in
a
new
spring
overcoat
and
a
taffycolored
fedora
.
Brown
eyes
,
eyebrow
mustache
.
Oval
face
without
an
expression
in
the
world
.
We
didn't
have
time
to
speak
before
Eileen's
voice
was
screeching
at
us
from
the
bed
.
``
Joseph
Maria
Ballestre
meet
Francis
Xavier
Bowman
.
Exboyfriend
meet
exhusband
''
.
She
gave
the
nastiest
laugh
I
ever
heard
.
``
And
don't
either
of
you
forget
that
I'm
not
any
man's
property
.
If
you
want
to
fight
,
go
down
on
the
sidewalk
''
.
She
was
enjoying
the
situation
.
Imagine
that
.
Eileen
was
a
psychologist
all
right
.
Instead
of
wanting
to
sock
the
poor
bastard
I
found
myself
having
a
fellowfeeling
for
him
.
Maybe
he
felt
the
same
way
.
I
never
felt
such
a
lowdown
hound
in
my
life
.
First
thing
I
knew
he
was
in
the
kitchenette
cooking
up
the
breakfast
and
I
was
handing
Eileen
her
coffeecup
and
she
was
lying
there
handsome
as
a
queen
among
her
courtiers
.
I
couldn't
face
Thelma
after
that
night
.
I
didn't
even
have
the
nerve
to
call
her
on
the
telephone
.
I
wrote
her
that
I'd
met
up
with
Eileen
and
that
old
bonds
had
proved
too
strong
and
asked
her
to
send
my
clothes
down
by
express
.
Of
course
I
had
to
give
her
Eileen's
address
,
but
she
never
came
near
us
.
All
she
did
was
write
me
a
pleasant
little
note
about
how
it
was
beautiful
while
it
lasted
but
that
now
life
had
parted
our
ways
and
it
was
goodbye
forever
.
She
never
said
a
word
about
the
fifty
dollars
.
She
added
a
postscript
begging
me
to
be
careful
about
drinking
.
I
must
know
that
that
was
my
greatest
weakness
underlined
three
times
.
Afterwards
I
learned
that
Eileen
had
called
Thelma
on
the
telephone
and
made
a
big
scene
about
Thelma
trying
to
take
her
husband
away
.
That
finished
me
with
Thelma
.
Trust
Eileen
to
squeeze
all
the
drama
out
of
a
situation
.
And
there
I
was
shacked
up
with
Eileen
in
that
filthy
fourth
floor
attic
on
Hudson
Street
.
I
use
the
phrase
advisedly
because
there
was
something
positively
indecent
about
our
relationship
.
I
felt
it
and
it
ate
on
me
all
the
time
,
but
I
didn't
know
how
right
I
was
till
later
.
What
I
did
know
was
that
Precious
was
always
around
.
He
slept
in
the
hall
bedroom
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
.
``
Who
do
you
think
pays
the
rent
?
?
You
wouldn't
have
me
throw
the
poor
boy
out
on
the
street
''
,
Eileen
said
when
I
needled
her
about
it
.
I
said
sure
that
was
what
I
wanted
her
to
do
but
she
paid
no
attention
.
Eileen
had
a
wonderful
way
of
not
listening
to
things
she
didn't
want
to
hear
.
Still
I
didn't
think
she
was
twotiming
me
with
Precious
right
then
.
To
be
on
the
safe
side
I
never
let
Eileen
get
out
of
my
sight
day
or
night
.
Precious
had
me
worried
.
I
couldn't
make
out
what
his
racket
was
.
I'd
thought
him
a
pimp
or
procurer
but
he
didn't
seem
to
be
.
He
was
smooth
and
civil
spoken
but
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
something
tough
under
his
selfeffacing
manner
.
Still
he
let
Eileen
treat
him
like
a
valet
.
Whenever
the
place
was
cleaned
or
a
meal
served
it
was
Precious
who
did
the
work
.
I
never
could
find
out
what
his
business
was
.
He
always
seemed
to
have
money
in
his
pocket
.
The
phone
had
been
disconnected
but
telegrams
came
for
him
and
notes
by
special
messenger
.
Now
and
then
he
would
disappear
for
several
days
.
``
Connections
''
was
all
he
would
say
with
that
smooth
hurt
smile
when
I
put
leading
questions
.
``
Oh
he's
just
an
international
spy
''
,
Eileen
would
shout
with
her
screechy
laugh
.
Poor
devil
he
can't
have
been
too
happy
either
.
He
got
no
relief
from
drink
because
,
though
sometimes
Precious
would
buy
himself
a
drink
if
he
went
out
with
us
in
the
evening
,
he'd
leave
it
on
the
table
untouched
.
When
I
was
in
liquor
I
rode
him
pretty
hard
I
guess
.
Occasionally
if
I
pushed
him
too
far
he'd
give
me
a
look
out
of
narrowed
eyes
and
the
hard
cruel
bony
skull
would
show
through
that
smooth
face
of
his
.
``
Some
day
''
,
I
told
Eileen
,
``
that
guy
will
kill
us
both
''
.
She
just
wouldn't
listen
.
Getting
drunk
every
night
was
the
only
way
I
could
handle
the
situation
.
Eileen
seemed
to
feel
the
same
way
.
We
still
had
that
much
in
common
.
The
trouble
was
drinking
cost
money
.
The
way
Eileen
and
I
were
hitting
it
up
,
we
needed
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
an
evening
.
Eileen
must
have
wheedled
a
little
out
of
Precious
.
I
raised
some
kale
by
hocking
the
good
clothes
I
had
left
over
from
my
respectable
uptown
life
,
but
when
that
was
gone
I
didn't
have
a
cent
.
I
don't
know
what
we
would
have
done
if
Pat
O'Dwyer
hadn't
come
to
town
.
Pat
O'Dwyer
looked
like
a
heavier
Jim
.
He
had
the
same
bullet
head
of
curly
reddish
hair
but
he
didn't
have
Jim's
pokerfaced
humor
or
his
brains
or
his
charm
.
He
was
a
big
thick
beefy
violent
man
.
Now
Pat
may
have
been
a
lecher
and
a
plugugly
,
but
he
was
a
good
churchgoing
Catholic
and
he
loved
his
little
sister
.
Those
O'Dwyers
had
that
Irish
clannishness
that
made
them
stick
together
in
spite
of
politics
and
everything
.
Pat
took
Eileen
and
me
out
to
dinner
at
a
swell
steak
house
and
told
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
happy
he
was
we
had
come
together
again
.
``
Whom
God
hath
joined
''
etcetera
.
The
O'Dwyers
were
real
religious
people
except
for
Kate
.
Now
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
keep
the
little
girl
out
of
mischief
.
Pat
had
been
worried
as
hell
ever
since
she'd
lost
her
job
on
that
fashion
magazine
.
It
had
gone
big
with
the
Hollywood
girls
when
he
told
them
his
sister
was
an
editor
of
Art
And
Apparel
.
How
about
me
trying
to
help
her
get
her
job
back
?
?
All
evening
Eileen
had
been
as
demure
as
a
little
girl
getting
ready
for
her
first
communion
.
It
just
about
blew
us
both
out
of
the
water
when
Eileen
suddenly
came
out
with
what
she
came
out
with
.
``
But
brother
I
can't
take
a
job
right
now
''
,
she
said
with
her
eyes
on
her
ice
cream
,
``
I'm
going
to
have
a
baby
,
Francis
Xavier's
baby
,
my
own
husband's
baby
''
.
My
first
thought
was
how
had
it
happened
so
soon
,
but
I
counted
back
on
my
fingers
and
sure
enough
we'd
been
living
together
six
weeks
.
Pat
meanwhile
was
bubbling
over
with
sentiment
.
Greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
.
Now
Eileen
really
would
have
to
settle
down
to
love
honor
and
obey
,
and
she'd
have
to
quit
drinking
.
He'd
come
East
for
the
christening
,
by
God
he
would
.
When
we
separated
that
evening
Pat
pushed
a
hundred
dollar
bill
into
Eileen's
hand
to
help
towards
a
layette
.
Before
he
left
town
Pat
saw
to
it
that
I
was
fixed
up
with
a
job
.
Pat
had
contacts
all
over
the
labor
movement
.
A
friend
of
Pat's
named
Frank
Sposato
had
just
muscled
into
the
Portwatchers'
Union
.
The
portwatchers
were
retired
longshoremen
and
small
time
seafarers
off
towboats
and
barges
who
acted
as
watchmen
on
the
wharves
.
Most
of
them
were
elderly
men
.
It
was
responsible
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
because
the
thieving
is
awful
in
the
port
of
New
York
.
They
weren't
as
well
paid
as
they
should
have
been
.
One
reason
the
portwatchers
let
Sposato
take
them
over
was
to
get
the
protection
of
his
musclemen
.
Sposato
needed
a
front
,
some
labor
stiff
with
a
clean
record
to
act
as
business
agent
of
the
Redhook
local
.
There
I
was
a
retired
wobbly
and
structural
iron
worker
who'd
never
gouged
a
cent
off
a
fellow
worker
in
my
thirty
years
in
the
movement
.
For
once
radicalism
was
a
recommendation
.
Sposato
couldn't
wait
to
get
me
hired
.
With
my
gray
hair
and
my
weatherbeaten
countenance
I
certainly
looked
the
honest
working
stiff
.
The
things
a
man
will
do
for
a
woman
.
There
was
one
fact
which
Rector
could
not
overlook
,
one
truth
which
he
could
not
deny
.
As
long
as
there
were
two
human
beings
working
together
on
the
same
project
,
there
would
be
competition
and
you
could
no
more
escape
it
than
you
could
expect
to
escape
the
grave
.
No
matter
how
devoted
a
man
was
,
no
matter
how
fully
he
gave
his
life
to
the
Lord
,
he
could
never
extinguish
that
one
spark
of
pride
that
gave
him
definition
as
an
individual
.
All
of
the
jobs
in
the
mission
might
be
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
,
but
they
were
certainly
not
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord's
servants
.
It
was
only
natural
that
Fletcher
would
strive
for
a
position
in
which
he
could
make
the
decisions
.
Even
Rector
himself
was
prey
to
this
spirit
of
competition
and
he
knew
it
,
not
for
a
more
exalted
office
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
--
his
ambitions
for
the
bishopry
had
died
very
early
in
his
career
--
but
for
the
one
clear
victory
he
had
talked
about
to
the
colonel
.
He
was
not
sure
how
much
of
this
desire
was
due
to
his
devotion
to
the
church
and
how
much
was
his
own
ego
,
demanding
to
be
satisfied
,
for
the
two
were
intertwined
and
could
not
be
separated
.
He
wanted
desperately
to
see
Kayabashi
defeated
,
the
Communists
in
the
village
rooted
out
,
the
mission
standing
triumphant
,
for
in
the
triumph
of
the
Lord
he
himself
would
be
triumphant
,
too
.
But
perhaps
this
was
a
part
of
the
eternal
plan
,
that
man's
ambition
when
linked
with
God
would
be
a
driving
,
indefatigable
force
for
good
in
the
world
.
He
sighed
.
How
foolish
it
was
to
try
to
fathom
the
truth
in
an
area
where
only
faith
would
suffice
.
He
would
have
to
work
without
questioning
the
motives
which
made
him
work
and
content
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
eventual
victory
,
however
it
was
brought
about
,
would
be
sweet
indeed
.
His
first
move
was
to
send
Hino
to
the
village
to
spend
a
few
days
.
His
arm
had
been
giving
him
some
trouble
and
Rector
was
not
enough
of
a
medical
expert
to
determine
whether
it
had
healed
improperly
or
whether
Hino
was
simply
rebelling
against
the
tedious
work
in
the
print
shop
,
using
the
stiffness
in
his
arm
as
an
excuse
.
In
any
event
Rector
sent
him
to
the
local
hospital
to
have
it
checked
,
telling
him
to
keep
his
ears
open
while
he
was
in
the
village
to
see
if
he
could
find
out
what
Kayabashi
was
planning
.
Hino
was
elated
at
the
prospect
.
He
was
allowed
to
spend
his
nights
at
an
inn
near
the
hospital
and
he
was
given
some
extra
money
to
go
to
the
pachinko
parlor
--
an
excellent
place
to
make
contact
with
the
enemy
.
He
left
with
all
the
joyous
spirit
of
a
child
going
on
a
holiday
,
nodding
attentively
as
Rector
gave
him
his
final
instructions
.
He
was
to
get
involved
in
no
arguments
;
;
he
was
to
try
to
make
no
converts
;
;
he
was
simply
to
listen
and
report
back
what
he
heard
.
It
was
a
ridiculous
situation
and
Rector
knew
it
,
for
Hino
,
frankly
partisan
,
openly
gregarious
,
would
make
a
poor
espionage
agent
.
If
he
wanted
to
know
anything
,
he
would
end
up
asking
about
it
point-blank
,
but
in
this
guileless
manner
he
would
probably
receive
more
truthful
answers
than
if
he
tried
to
get
them
by
indirection
.
In
all
of
his
experience
in
the
mission
field
Rector
had
never
seen
a
convert
quite
like
Hino
.
From
the
moment
that
Hino
had
first
walked
into
the
mission
to
ask
for
a
job
,
any
job
--
his
qualifications
neatly
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
precise
hand
--
he
had
been
ready
to
become
a
Christian
.
He
had
already
been
studying
the
Bible
;
;
he
knew
the
fundamentals
,
and
after
studying
with
Fletcher
for
a
time
he
approached
Rector
,
announced
that
he
wanted
to
be
baptized
and
that
was
that
.
Rector
had
never
been
able
to
find
out
much
about
Hino's
past
.
Hino
talked
very
little
about
himself
except
for
the
infrequent
times
when
he
used
a
personal
illustration
in
connection
with
another
subject
.
Putting
the
pieces
of
this
mosaic
together
,
Rector
had
the
vague
outlines
of
a
biography
.
Hino
was
the
fourth
son
of
an
elderly
farmer
who
lived
on
the
coast
,
in
Chiba
,
and
divided
his
life
between
the
land
and
the
sea
,
supplementing
the
marginal
livelihood
on
his
small
rented
farm
with
seasonal
employment
on
a
fishing
boat
.
Without
exception
Hino's
brothers
turned
to
either
one
or
both
of
their
father's
occupations
,
but
Hino
showed
a
talent
for
neither
and
instead
spent
most
of
his
time
on
the
beach
where
he
repaired
nets
and
proved
immensely
popular
as
a
storyteller
.
He
had
gone
into
the
Japanese
navy
,
had
been
trained
as
an
officer
,
had
participated
in
one
or
two
battles
--
he
never
went
into
detail
regarding
his
military
experience
--
and
at
the
age
of
twenty-five
,
quite
as
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
,
he
had
walked
into
the
mission
as
if
he
belonged
here
and
had
become
a
Christian
.
Rector
was
often
curious
;
;
often
tempted
to
ask
questions
but
he
never
did
.
If
and
when
Hino
decided
to
tell
him
about
his
experiences
,
he
would
do
so
unasked
.
Rector
had
no
doubt
that
Hino
would
come
back
from
the
village
bursting
with
information
,
ready
to
impart
it
with
his
customary
gusto
,
liberally
embellished
with
his
active
imagnation
.
When
the
telephone
rang
on
the
day
after
Hino
went
down
to
the
village
,
Rector
had
a
hunch
it
would
be
Hino
with
some
morsel
of
information
too
important
to
wait
until
his
return
,
for
there
were
few
telephones
in
the
village
and
the
phone
in
Rector's
office
rarely
rang
unless
it
was
important
.
He
was
surprised
to
find
Kayabashi's
secretary
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
.
He
was
even
more
startled
when
he
heard
what
Kayabashi
wanted
.
The
oyabun
was
entertaining
a
group
of
dignitaries
,
the
secretary
said
,
businessmen
from
Tokyo
for
the
most
part
,
and
Kayabashi
wished
to
show
them
the
mission
.
They
had
never
seen
one
before
and
had
expressed
a
curiosity
about
it
.
``
Oh
''
?
?
Rector
said
.
``
I
guess
it
will
be
all
right
.
When
would
the
oyabun
like
to
bring
his
guests
up
here
''
?
?
``
This
afternoon
''
,
the
secretary
said
.
``
At
three
o'clock
if
it
will
be
of
convenience
to
you
at
that
time
''
.
``
All
right
''
,
Rector
said
.
``
I
will
be
expecting
them
''
.
He
was
about
to
hang
up
the
phone
,
but
a
note
of
hesitancy
in
the
secretary's
voice
left
the
conversation
open
.
He
had
something
more
to
say
.
``
I
beg
to
inquire
if
the
back
is
now
safe
for
travelers
''
,
he
said
.
Rector
laughed
despite
himself
.
``
Unless
the
oyabun
has
been
working
on
it
''
,
he
said
,
then
checked
himself
and
added
:
``
You
can
tell
Kayabashi-san
that
the
back
road
is
in
very
good
condition
and
will
be
quite
safe
for
his
party
to
use
''
.
``
Arigato
gosaimasu
''
.
The
secretary
sighed
with
relief
and
then
the
telephone
clicked
in
Rector's
hand
.
Rector
had
no
idea
why
Kayabashi
wanted
to
visit
the
mission
.
For
the
oyabun
to
make
such
a
trip
was
either
a
sign
of
great
weakness
or
an
indication
of
equally
great
confidence
,
and
from
all
the
available
information
it
was
probably
the
latter
.
Kayabashi
must
feel
fairly
certain
of
his
victory
in
order
to
make
a
visit
like
this
,
a
trip
which
could
be
so
easily
misinterpreted
by
the
people
in
the
village
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
was
unlikely
that
any
businessmen
would
spend
a
day
in
a
Christian
mission
out
of
mere
curiosity
.
No
,
Kayabashi
was
bringing
his
associates
here
for
a
specific
purpose
and
Rector
would
not
be
able
to
fathom
it
until
they
arrived
.
When
he
had
given
the
call
a
few
moments
thought
,
he
went
into
the
kitchen
to
ask
Mrs.
Yamata
to
prepare
tea
and
sushi
for
the
visitors
,
using
the
formal
English
china
and
the
silver
tea
service
which
had
been
donated
to
the
mission
,
then
he
went
outside
to
inspect
the
grounds
.
Fujimoto
had
a
pile
of
cuttings
near
one
side
of
the
lawn
.
Rector
asked
him
to
move
it
for
the
time
being
;
;
he
wanted
the
mission
compound
to
be
effortlessly
spotless
.
A
good
initial
impression
would
be
important
now
.
He
went
into
the
print
shop
,
where
Fletcher
had
just
finished
cleaning
the
press
.
``
How
many
pamphlets
do
we
have
in
stock
''
?
?
Rector
said
.
``
I
should
say
about
a
hundred
thousand
''
,
Fletcher
said
.
``
Why
''
?
?
``
I
would
like
to
enact
a
little
tableau
this
afternoon
''
,
Rector
said
,
He
explained
about
the
visit
and
the
effect
he
wished
to
create
,
the
picture
of
a
very
busy
mission
.
He
did
not
wish
to
deceive
Kayabashi
exactly
,
just
to
display
the
mission
activities
in
a
graphic
and
impressive
manner
.
Fletcher
nodded
as
he
listened
to
the
instructions
and
said
he
would
arrange
the
things
Rector
requested
.
Rector's
next
stop
was
at
the
schoolroom
,
where
Mavis
was
monitoring
a
test
.
He
beckoned
to
her
from
the
door
and
she
slipped
quietly
outside
.
He
told
her
of
the
visitors
and
then
of
his
plans
.
``
How
many
children
do
you
have
present
today
''
?
?
He
said
.
She
looked
back
toward
the
schoolroom
.
``
Fifteen
''
,
she
said
.
``
No
,
only
fourteen
.
The
little
Ito
girl
had
had
to
go
home
.
She
has
a
pretty
bad
cold
''
.
``
I
would
like
them
to
appear
very
busy
today
,
not
busy
exactly
,
but
joyous
,
exuberant
,
full
of
life
.
I
want
to
create
the
impression
of
a
compound
full
of
children
.
Do
you
think
you
can
manage
it
''
?
?
Mavis
smiled
.
``
I'll
try
''
.
As
Rector
was
walking
back
toward
the
residential
hall
,
Johnson
came
out
of
the
basement
and
bounded
up
to
him
.
The
altercation
in
the
coffee
house
had
done
little
to
dampen
his
spirits
,
but
he
was
still
a
little
wary
around
Rector
for
they
had
not
yet
discussed
the
incident
.
``
I
think
I've
fixed
the
pump
so
we
won't
have
to
worry
about
it
for
a
long
time
''
,
he
said
.
``
I've
adjusted
the
gauge
so
that
the
pump
cuts
out
before
the
water
gets
too
low
.
''
``
Fine
''
,
Rector
said
.
He
looked
out
over
the
expanse
of
the
compound
.
It
was
going
to
take
a
lot
of
activity
to
fill
it
.
``
Have
you
ever
operated
a
transit
''
?
?
He
said
.
``
No
,
sir
''
,
Johnson
said
.
``
You
are
about
to
become
a
first-class
surveyor
''
,
Rector
said
.
``
When
Konishi
gets
back
with
the
jeep
,
I
want
you
to
round
up
two
or
three
Japanese
boys
.
Konishi
can
help
you
.
You'll
find
an
old
transit
in
the
basement
.
The
glass
is
out
of
it
,
but
that
won't
matter
.
It
looks
pretty
efficient
and
that's
the
important
thing
''
.
He
went
on
to
explain
what
he
had
in
mind
.
Johnson
nodded
.
He
said
he
could
do
it
.
Rector
was
warming
to
his
over-all
strategy
by
the
time
he
got
back
to
the
residential
hall
.
It
was
rather
a
childish
game
,
all
in
all
,
but
everybody
seemed
to
be
getting
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
he
could
not
remember
when
he
had
enjoyed
planning
anything
quite
so
much
.
He
was
not
sure
what
effect
it
would
have
,
but
that
was
really
beside
the
point
when
you
got
right
down
to
it
.
He
was
not
going
to
lose
the
mission
by
default
,
and
whatever
reason
Kayabashi
had
for
bringing
his
little
sight-seeing
group
to
the
mission
,
he
was
going
to
be
in
for
a
surprise
.
He
found
Elizabeth
in
the
parlor
and
asked
her
to
make
sure
everything
was
in
order
in
the
residential
hall
,
and
then
to
take
charge
of
the
office
while
the
party
was
here
.
When
everything
had
been
done
,
Rector
went
back
to
his
desk
to
occupy
himself
with
his
monthly
report
until
three
o'clock
.
At
two
thirty
he
sent
Fujimoto
to
the
top
of
the
wall
at
the
northeast
corner
of
the
mission
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
ridge
road
and
give
a
signal
when
he
first
glimpsed
the
approach
of
Kayabashi's
party
.
Then
Rector
,
attired
in
his
best
blue
serge
suit
,
sat
in
a
chair
out
on
the
lawn
,
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
smoking
a
cigarette
and
waiting
.
The
air
was
cooler
here
,
and
the
lacy
pattern
of
the
trees
threw
a
dappled
shadow
on
the
grass
,
an
effect
which
he
found
pleasant
.
She
concluded
by
asking
him
to
name
another
hour
should
this
one
be
inconvenient
.
The
fish
took
the
bait
.
He
replied
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
importance
there
might
be
in
thus
meeting
with
a
stranger
,
but
--
joy
of
joys
,
he
would
be
at
home
at
the
hour
mentioned
.
But
when
she
called
he
had
thought
better
of
the
matter
and
decided
not
to
involve
himself
in
a
new
entanglement
.
She
was
told
by
the
manservant
who
opened
the
door
that
his
lordship
was
engaged
on
work
from
which
he
had
left
strict
orders
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
.
Claire
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
determined
not
to
let
the
rebuff
daunt
her
purpose
.
She
wrote
again
and
now
,
abandoning
for
the
moment
the
theme
of
love
,
she
asked
for
help
in
the
matter
of
her
career
.
She
could
act
and
she
could
write
.
His
lordship
was
concerned
in
the
management
of
Drury
Lane
but
,
if
there
were
no
opportunities
there
,
would
he
read
and
criticize
her
novel
?
?
At
last
he
consented
to
meet
her
,
and
following
that
brief
interview
Claire
wrote
him
a
yet
more
remarkable
proposal
:
Have
you
any
objection
to
the
following
plan
?
?
On
Thursday
evening
we
may
go
out
of
town
together
by
some
stage
or
mail
about
the
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
.
There
we
shall
be
free
and
unknown
;
;
we
can
return
the
following
morning
She
concluded
by
asking
for
a
brief
interview
--
``
to
settle
with
you
where
''
--
and
she
threw
in
a
tribute
to
his
``
gentle
manners
''
and
``
the
wild
originality
of
your
countenance
''
.
She
opened
his
reply
with
trembling
fingers
he
agreed
!
!
And
he
would
see
her
that
evening
.
Victory
at
last
!
!
At
their
meeting
he
told
her
not
to
bother
about
``
where
''
--
he
would
attend
to
that
.
There
was
one
of
the
new
forte-pianos
in
the
room
and
,
as
Claire
rose
to
go
,
he
asked
her
to
sing
him
one
song
before
she
left
.
She
sang
him
Scott's
charming
ballad
``
Rosabelle
''
,
which
was
the
vogue
of
the
moment
.
She
had
never
sung
better
.
``
Your
voice
is
delightful
''
,
he
approved
with
a
warm
smile
.
``
Tomorrow
will
be
a
new
experience
--
I
have
never
before
made
love
to
a
nightingale
.
There
have
been
cooing
doves
,
chattering
magpies
,
thieving
jackdaws
,
a
proud
peacock
,
a
silly
goose
,
and
a
harpy
eagle
--
whom
I
was
silly
enough
to
mate
with
and
who
is
now
busy
tearing
at
my
vitals
''
.
And
so
they
went
,
he
choosing
of
all
places
an
inn
near
Medmenham
Abbey
,
scene
a
generation
ago
of
the
obscene
orgies
of
the
Hellfire
Club
.
He
regaled
Claire
with
an
account
of
the
mock
mass
performed
by
the
cassocked
bloods
,
which
he
had
had
at
firsthand
from
old
Bud
Dodington
,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
so-called
``
Order
''
.
Each
wore
the
monkish
scourge
at
his
waist
but
this
,
it
seems
,
was
not
employed
for
self-flagellation
.
Naked
girls
danced
in
the
chancel
of
the
Abbey
,
the
youngest
and
seemingly
the
most
innocent
being
chosen
to
read
a
sermon
filled
with
veiled
depravities
.
The
jaded
amorist
conjured
up
pictures
of
the
blasphemous
rites
with
relish
.
Alas
,
all
that
belonged
to
the
age
of
``
Devil
Dashwood
''
and
``
Wicked
Wilkes
''
,
abbot
and
beadsman
of
the
Order
!
!
The
casual
seduction
of
a
seventeen-year-old
bluestocking
seemed
tame
by
comparison
.
They
passed
close
by
the
turn
to
Bishopsgate
.
A
scant
half
mile
away
Shelley
and
Mary
were
doubtless
sitting
on
their
diminutive
terrace
,
the
air
about
them
scented
with
stock
,
and
listening
to
the
nightingale
who
had
nested
in
the
big
lime
tree
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
.
Charming
and
peaceful
--
but
what
were
charm
and
peace
compared
to
high
adventure
?
?
Alone
with
the
fabulous
Byron
!
!
How
many
women
had
longed
for
the
privilege
that
was
hers
.
How
was
she
to
behave
,
Claire
wondered
.
To
be
passive
,
to
be
girlishly
shy
was
palpably
absurd
.
She
was
the
pursuer
as
clearly
as
was
Venus
in
Shakespeare's
poem
.
And
while
her
Adonis
did
not
suffer
from
inexperience
,
satiety
might
well
be
an
equal
handicap
.
No
,
she
would
not
pretend
modesty
,
but
neither
must
she
be
crudely
bold
.
Mystery
--
that
was
the
thing
.
In
the
bedroom
she
would
insist
on
darkness
.
With
his
club
foot
he
might
well
be
grateful
.
At
the
inn
,
which
was
situated
close
to
a
broad
weir
,
Byron
was
greeted
by
the
landlord
with
obsequious
deference
and
addressed
as
``
milord
''
.
The
place
was
evidently
a
familiar
haunt
and
Claire
wondered
what
other
illicit
loves
had
been
celebrated
in
the
comfortable
rooms
to
which
they
were
shown
.
The
fire
in
the
sitting
room
was
lighted
.
``
What
about
the
bedroom
''
?
?
Byron
inquired
.
``
Seems
to
me
last
time
I
was
here
the
grate
bellowed
out
smoke
as
it
might
have
been
preparing
us
for
hell
''
.
``
We
found
some
owls
had
built
a
nest
in
the
chimney
,
milord
,
but
I
promise
you
you'll
never
have
trouble
of
that
sort
again
''
.
So
,
not
only
had
he
been
here
before
,
but
it
seemed
he
might
well
come
again
.
Claire
felt
suddenly
small
and
cheap
,
heroine
of
a
trivial
episode
in
the
voluminous
history
of
Don
Juan
.
A
cold
supper
was
ordered
and
a
bottle
of
port
.
When
Napoleon's
ship
had
borne
him
to
Elba
,
French
wines
had
started
to
cross
the
Channel
,
the
first
shipments
in
a
dozen
war-ridden
years
,
but
the
supplies
had
not
yet
reached
rural
hostelries
where
the
sweet
wines
of
the
Spanish
peninsula
still
ruled
.
As
they
waited
for
supper
they
sat
by
the
fire
,
glasses
in
hand
,
while
Byron
philosophized
as
much
for
his
own
entertainment
as
hers
.
``
Sex
is
overpriced
''
,
he
said
.
``
The
great
Greek
tragedies
are
concerned
with
man
against
Fate
,
not
man
against
man
for
the
prize
of
a
woman's
body
.
So
don't
see
yourself
as
a
heroine
or
fancy
this
little
adventure
is
an
event
of
major
importance
''
.
``
The
gods
seemed
to
think
sex
pretty
important
''
,
she
rebutted
.
``
Mars
and
Venus
,
Bacchus
and
Ariadne
,
Jupiter
and
Io
,
Byron
and
the
nymph
of
the
owl's
nest
.
That
would
be
Minerva
,
I
suppose
.
Wasn't
the
owl
her
symbol
''
?
?
Byron
laughed
.
``
So
you
know
something
of
the
classics
,
do
you
''
?
?
``
Tell
me
about
Minerva
,
how
she
behaved
,
what
she
did
to
please
you
''
.
``
I'll
tell
you
nothing
.
I
don't
ask
you
who
'tis
you're
being
unfaithful
to
,
husband
or
lover
.
Frankly
,
I
don't
care
''
.
For
a
moment
she
thought
of
answering
with
the
truth
but
she
knew
there
were
men
who
shied
away
from
virginity
,
who
demanded
some
degree
of
education
in
body
as
well
as
mind
.
``
Very
well
''
,
she
said
,
``
I'll
not
catechize
you
.
What
matter
the
others
so
long
as
I
have
my
place
in
history
''
.
She
was
striking
the
right
note
.
No
man
ever
had
a
better
opinion
of
himself
and
indeed
,
with
one
so
favored
,
flattery
could
hardly
seem
overdone
.
Brains
and
beauty
,
high
position
in
both
the
social
and
intellectual
worlds
,
athlete
,
fabled
lover
--
if
ever
the
world
was
any
man's
oyster
it
was
his
.
The
light
supper
over
,
Claire
went
to
him
and
,
slipping
an
arm
about
his
shoulder
,
sat
on
his
knee
.
He
drew
her
close
and
,
hand
on
cheek
,
turned
her
face
to
his
.
Her
lips
,
moist
and
parted
,
spoke
his
name
.
``
Byron
''
!
!
His
hand
went
to
her
shoulder
and
pushed
aside
the
knotted
scarf
that
surmounted
the
striped
poplin
gown
;
;
then
,
to
better
purpose
,
he
took
hold
of
the
knot
and
with
dextrous
fingers
,
untied
it
.
The
bodice
beneath
was
buttoned
and
,
withdrawing
his
lips
from
hers
,
he
set
her
upright
on
his
knee
and
started
to
undo
it
,
unhurriedly
as
if
she
were
a
child
.
But
,
kindled
by
his
kiss
,
his
caressing
hand
,
her
desire
was
aflame
.
She
sprang
up
and
went
swiftly
to
the
bedroom
.
Lord
Byron
poured
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
held
it
up
to
the
candle
flame
admiring
the
rich
color
.
He
drank
slowly
with
due
appreciation
.
It
was
an
excellent
vintage
.
He
rose
and
went
to
the
bedroom
.
Pausing
in
the
doorway
he
said
:
``
The
form
of
the
human
female
,
unlike
her
mind
and
her
spirit
,
is
the
most
challenging
loveliness
in
all
nature
''
.
When
Claire
returned
to
Bishopsgate
she
longed
to
tell
them
she
had
become
Byron's
mistress
.
By
odd
coincidence
,
on
the
evening
of
her
return
Shelley
chose
to
read
Parisina
,
which
was
the
latest
of
the
titled
poet's
successes
.
As
he
declaimed
the
sonorous
measures
,
it
was
as
much
as
Claire
could
do
to
restrain
herself
from
bursting
out
with
her
dramatic
tidings
.
``
Although
it
is
not
the
best
of
which
he
is
capable
''
,
said
Shelley
as
he
closed
the
book
,
``
it
is
still
poetry
of
a
high
order
''
.
``
If
he
would
only
leave
the
East
''
,
said
Mary
.
``
I
am
tired
of
sultans
and
scimitars
''
.
``
The
hero
of
his
next
poem
is
Napoleon
Bonaparte
''
,
said
Claire
,
with
slightly
overdone
carelessness
.
``
How
do
you
know
that
''
?
?
Demanded
Mary
.
``
I
was
told
it
on
good
authority
''
,
Claire
answered
darkly
.
``
I
mustn't
tell
,
I
mustn't
tell
''
,
she
repeated
to
herself
.
``
I
promised
him
I
wouldn't
''
.
Chapter
9
winter
came
,
and
with
it
Mary's
baby
--
a
boy
as
she
had
wished
.
William
,
he
was
called
,
in
honor
of
the
man
who
was
at
once
Shelley's
pensioner
and
his
most
bitter
detractor
.
With
a
pardonable
irony
Shelley
wrote
to
the
father
who
had
publicly
disowned
his
daughter
:
``
Fanny
and
Mrs.
Godwin
will
probably
be
glad
to
hear
that
Mary
has
safely
recovered
from
a
very
favorable
confinement
,
and
that
her
child
is
well
''
.
At
the
same
time
another
child
--
this
one
of
Shelley's
brain
--
was
given
to
the
world
:
Alastor
,
a
poem
of
pervading
beauty
in
which
the
reader
may
gaze
into
the
still
depths
of
a
fine
mind's
musings
.
Alastor
was
published
only
to
be
savagely
attacked
,
contemptuously
ignored
.
Shelley
sent
a
copy
to
Southey
,
a
former
friend
,
and
another
to
Godwin
.
Neither
acknowledged
the
gift
.
Only
Mary's
praise
sustained
him
in
his
disappointment
.
She
understood
completely
.
Not
a
thought
nor
a
cadence
was
missed
in
her
summary
of
appreciation
.
``
You
have
made
the
labor
worth
while
''
,
he
said
to
her
,
smiling
.
``
And
in
the
future
,
since
I
write
for
a
public
of
one
,
I
can
save
the
poor
publishers
from
wasting
their
money
''
.
``
A
public
of
one
''
,
Mary
echoed
reprovingly
.
``
How
can
you
say
such
a
thing
?
?
There
will
be
thousands
who
will
thrill
to
the
loveliness
of
Alastor
.
There
are
some
even
now
.
What
about
that
dear
,
clever
Mr.
Thynne
?
?
I
am
sure
he
is
in
raptures
''
.
``
Poor
Mr.
Thynne
,
he
always
has
to
be
trotted
out
for
my
encouragement
''
.
``
There
are
other
Mr.
Thynnes
.
Not
everyone
is
bewitched
by
Byron's
caliphs
and
harem
beauties
''
.
Mary's
supercritical
attitude
toward
Byron
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
moral
disrepute
.
She
was
resentful
of
his
easy
success
as
compared
with
Shelley's
failure
.
The
same
month
that
Alastor
was
published
,
Murray
sold
twenty
thousand
copies
of
The
Siege
Of
Corinth
,
a
slovenly
bit
of
Byronism
that
even
Shelley's
generosity
rebelled
at
.
The
lordly
poet
was
at
low-water
mark
.
The
careless
writing
was
in
keeping
with
his
mood
of
savage
discontent
.
On
all
sides
doors
were
being
slammed
in
his
face
.
The
previous
scandals
,
gaily
diverting
as
they
were
,
had
only
served
to
increase
his
popularity
.
Now
,
under
the
impact
of
his
wife's
disclosures
,
he
was
brought
suddenly
to
the
realization
that
there
was
a
limit
to
tolerance
,
however
brilliant
,
however
far-famed
the
offender
might
be
.
He
tried
defiance
and
openly
flaunted
his
devotion
to
his
half
sister
,
but
he
soon
saw
,
as
did
she
,
that
this
course
if
persisted
in
would
involve
them
in
a
common
ruin
.
For
the
moment
there
was
no
woman
in
his
life
,
and
it
was
this
vacuum
that
had
given
Claire
her
opportunity
.
But
the
liaison
successfully
started
in
the
last
days
of
autumn
was
now
languishing
.
Byron
,
since
the
separation
from
his
wife
had
been
living
in
a
smallish
house
in
Piccadilly
Terrace
.
He
refused
to
bring
Claire
to
it
even
as
an
occasional
visitor
,
claiming
that
his
every
move
was
watched
by
spies
of
the
Milbankes
.
Beckworth
handed
the
pass
to
the
colonel
.
He
had
thought
that
the
suggestion
of
taking
it
himself
would
tip
the
colonel
in
the
direction
of
serving
his
own
order
,
but
the
slip
of
paper
was
folded
and
absently
thrust
into
the
colonel's
belt
.
Despite
his
yearning
,
the
colonel
would
not
go
down
to
see
the
men
come
through
the
lines
.
He
would
remain
in
the
tent
,
waiting
impatiently
,
occupied
by
some
trivial
task
.
--
Beckworth
.
--
Sir
?
?
--
Fetch
me
the
copies
of
everything
B
and
C
companies
have
requisitioned
in
the
last
six
months
.
--
The
last
six
months
,
sir
?
?
--
You
heard
me
.
There's
a
lot
of
waste
going
on
here
.
It's
got
to
stop
.
I
want
to
take
a
look
.
This
is
no
damned
holiday
,
Beckworth
.
Get
busy
.
--
Yes
,
sir
.
Beckworth
left
the
tent
.
Below
he
could
see
the
bright
torches
lighting
the
riverbank
.
He
glanced
back
.
The
colonel
crouched
tensely
on
one
of
the
folding
chairs
,
methodically
tearing
at
his
thumbnail
.
The
bombproof
was
a
low-ceilinged
structure
of
heavy
timbers
covered
with
earth
.
It
stood
some
fifty
paces
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
.
From
the
outside
,
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
low
drumlin
,
a
lump
on
the
dark
earth
.
A
crude
ladder
ran
down
to
a
wooden
floor
.
Two
slits
enabled
observers
to
watch
across
the
river
.
The
place
smelled
strongly
of
rank
,
fertile
earth
,
rotting
wood
and
urine
.
The
plank
floor
was
slimed
beneath
Watson's
boots
.
At
least
the
Union
officer
had
been
decent
enough
to
provide
a
candle
.
There
was
no
place
to
sit
,
but
Watson
walked
slowly
from
the
ladder
to
the
window
slits
and
back
,
stooping
slightly
to
avoid
striking
his
head
on
the
heavy
beams
.
In
the
corner
was
the
soldier
with
the
white
flag
.
He
stood
stiffly
erect
,
clutching
the
staff
,
his
body
half
hidden
by
the
limp
cloth
.
Watson
hardly
looked
at
him
.
The
man
had
come
floundering
aboard
the
flat-bottomed
barge
at
the
last
instant
,
brandishing
the
flag
of
truce
.
Someone
had
hauled
him
over
the
side
,
and
he
had
remained
silent
while
they
crossed
.
An
officer
with
a
squad
of
men
had
been
waiting
on
the
bank
.
The
men
in
the
boats
had
started
yelling
happily
at
first
sight
of
the
officer
,
two
of
them
calling
him
Billy
.
When
the
boat
had
touched
,
the
weaker
ones
and
the
two
wounded
men
had
been
lifted
out
and
carried
away
by
the
soldiers
.
Watson
had
presented
his
pouch
and
been
led
to
the
bombproof
.
The
officer
had
told
him
that
both
lists
must
be
checked
.
Watson
had
given
his
name
and
asked
for
a
safe-conduct
pass
.
The
officer
,
surprised
,
said
he
would
have
to
see
.
Watson
had
nodded
absently
and
muttered
that
he
would
check
the
lists
himself
later
.
He
had
peered
through
the
darkness
at
the
rampart
.
The
men
he
would
take
back
across
the
river
stood
there
,
but
he
turned
away
from
them
.
He
wanted
no
part
of
the
emotions
of
the
exchange
,
no
memory
of
the
joy
and
gratitude
that
other
men
felt
.
He
had
hoped
to
be
alone
in
the
bombproof
,
but
the
soldier
had
followed
him
.
Though
Watson
carefully
ignored
the
man
,
he
could
not
deny
his
presence
.
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
speak
to
him
,
since
silence
could
not
exorcise
his
form
.
Watson
glanced
briefly
at
him
,
seeing
only
a
body
rigidly
erect
behind
the
languid
banner
.
--
We
won't
be
too
long
.
If
my
pass
is
approved
,
I
may
be
a
half
hour
.
The
soldier
answered
in
a
curious
,
muffled
voice
,
his
lips
barely
moving
.
Watson
turned
away
and
did
not
see
the
man's
knees
buckle
and
his
body
sag
.
--
Yes
,
sir
.
He
had
acknowledged
the
man
.
It
was
easier
to
think
now
,
Watson
decided
.
The
stiff
figure
in
the
corner
no
longer
blocked
his
thoughts
.
He
paced
slowly
,
stooping
,
staring
at
the
damp
,
slippery
floor
.
He
tried
to
order
the
words
of
the
three
Union
officers
,
seeking
to
create
some
coherent
portrait
of
the
dead
boy
.
But
he
groped
blindly
.
His
lack
of
success
steadily
eroded
his
interest
.
He
stopped
pacing
,
leaned
against
the
dank
,
timbered
wall
and
let
his
mind
drift
.
A
feeling
of
futility
,
an
enervation
of
mind
greater
than
any
fatigue
he
had
ever
known
,
seeped
through
him
.
What
in
the
name
of
God
was
he
doing
,
crouched
in
a
timbered
pit
on
the
wrong
bank
of
the
river
?
?
Why
had
he
crossed
the
dark
water
,
to
bring
back
a
group
of
reclaimed
soldiers
or
to
skulk
in
a
foul-smelling
hole
?
?
He
grew
annoyed
and
at
the
same
time
surprised
at
that
emotion
.
He
was
conscious
of
a
growing
sense
of
absurdity
.
Hillman
had
written
it
all
out
,
hadn't
he
?
?
Wasn't
the
report
official
enough
?
?
What
did
he
hope
to
accomplish
here
?
?
Hillman
had
ordered
him
not
to
leave
the
far
bank
.
Prompted
by
a
guilty
urge
,
he
had
disobeyed
the
order
of
a
man
he
respected
.
For
what
?
?
To
tell
John
something
he
would
find
out
for
himself
.
The
figure
in
the
corner
belched
loudly
,
a
deep
,
liquid
eruption
.
Watson
snorted
and
then
laughed
aloud
.
Exactly
!
!
The
soldier's
voice
was
muffled
again
,
stricken
with
chagrin
.
He
clutched
the
staff
,
and
his
dark
eyes
blinked
apologetically
.
--
'scuse
me
,
sir
.
--
Let's
get
out
of
here
.
Watson
ran
up
the
ladder
and
stood
for
a
second
sucking
in
the
cool
air
that
smelled
of
mud
and
river
weeds
.
To
his
left
,
the
two
skiffs
dented
their
sharp
bows
into
the
soft
bank
.
The
flat-bottomed
boat
swung
slowly
to
the
pull
of
the
current
.
A
soldier
held
the
end
of
a
frayed
rope
.
Three
Union
guards
appeared
,
carrying
their
rifles
at
ready
.
Watson
stared
at
them
curiously
.
They
were
stocky
men
,
well
fed
and
clean-shaven
,
with
neat
uniforms
and
sturdy
boots
.
Behind
them
shambled
a
long
column
of
weak
,
tattered
men
.
The
thin
gray
figures
raised
a
hoarse
,
cawing
cry
like
the
call
of
a
bird
flock
.
They
moved
toward
the
skiffs
with
shocking
eagerness
,
elbowing
and
shoving
.
Four
men
were
knocked
down
,
but
did
not
attempt
to
rise
.
They
crept
down
the
muddy
slope
toward
the
waiting
boats
.
The
Union
soldiers
grounded
arms
and
settled
into
healthy
,
indifferent
postures
to
watch
the
feeble
boarding
of
the
skiffs
.
The
crawling
men
tried
to
rise
and
fell
again
.
No
one
moved
to
them
.
Watson
watched
two
of
them
flounder
into
the
shallow
water
and
listened
to
their
voices
beg
shrilly
.
In
a
confused
,
soaked
and
stumbling
shift
of
bodies
and
lifting
arms
,
the
two
men
were
dragged
into
the
same
skiff
.
The
third
crawling
man
forced
himself
erect
.
He
swayed
like
a
drunkard
,
his
arms
milling
in
slow
circles
.
He
paced
forward
unsteadily
,
leaning
too
far
back
,
his
head
tilted
oddly
.
His
steps
were
short
and
stiff
,
and
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
progress
was
a
supercilious
strut
.
He
appeared
to
be
peering
haughtily
down
his
nose
at
the
crowded
and
unclean
vessel
that
would
carry
him
to
freedom
.
He
stalked
into
the
water
and
fell
heavily
over
the
side
of
the
flat-bottomed
barge
,
his
weight
nearly
swamping
the
craft
.
Watson
looked
for
the
fourth
man
.
He
had
reached
the
three
passive
guards
;
;
he
crept
in
an
incertain
manner
,
patting
the
ground
before
him
.
The
guards
did
not
look
at
him
.
The
figure
on
the
earth
halted
,
seemingly
bewildered
.
He
sank
back
on
his
thin
haunches
like
a
weary
hound
.
Then
he
began
to
crawl
again
.
Watson
watched
the
creeping
figure
.
He
felt
a
spectator
interest
.
Would
the
man
make
it
or
not
?
?
If
only
there
was
a
clock
for
him
to
crawl
against
.
If
he
failed
to
reach
the
riverbank
in
five
minutes
,
say
,
then
the
skiffs
would
pull
away
and
leave
him
groping
in
the
mud
.
Say
three
minutes
to
make
it
sporting
.
Still
the
guards
did
not
move
,
but
stood
inert
,
aloof
from
the
slow-scrambling
man
.
The
figure
halted
,
and
Watson
gasped
.
The
man
began
to
creep
in
the
wrong
direction
,
deceived
by
a
slight
rise
in
the
ground
!
!
He
turned
slowly
and
began
to
crawl
back
up
the
bank
toward
the
rampart
.
Watson
raced
for
him
,
his
boots
slamming
the
soft
earth
.
The
guards
came
to
life
with
astonishing
menace
.
They
spun
and
flung
their
rifles
up
.
Watson
gesticulated
wildly
.
One
man
dropped
to
his
knee
for
better
aim
.
--
Let
me
help
him
,
for
the
love
of
God
!
!
The
guards
lowered
their
rifles
and
their
rifles
and
peered
at
Watson
with
sullen
,
puzzled
faces
.
Watson
pounded
to
the
crawling
man
and
stopped
,
panting
heavily
.
He
reached
down
and
closed
his
fingers
on
the
man's
upper
arm
.
Beneath
his
clutch
,
a
flat
strip
of
muscle
surged
on
the
bone
.
Watson
bent
awkwardly
and
lifted
the
man
to
his
feet
.
Watson
stared
into
a
cadaverous
face
.
Two
clotted
balls
the
color
of
mucus
rolled
between
fiery
lids
.
Light
sticks
of
fingers
,
the
tips
gummy
with
dark
earth
,
patted
at
Watson's
throat
.
The
man's
voice
was
a
sweet
,
patient
whisper
.
--
Henry
said
that
he'd
take
my
arm
and
get
me
right
there
.
But
you
ain't
Henry
.
--
no
.
--
It
don't
matter
.
Is
it
far
?
?
How
far
could
it
be
,
Watson
thought
bleakly
,
how
far
can
a
blind
man
crawl
?
?
Another
body
length
or
all
the
rest
of
his
nighted
life
?
?
--
Not
far
.
--
You
talk
deep
.
Not
like
us
fellas
.
It
raises
the
voice
,
bein
in
camp
.
You
Secesh
?
?
--
yes
.
Come
on
,
now
.
Can
you
walk
?
?
--
Why
,
course
I
can
.
I
can
walk
real
good
.
Watson
stumbled
down
the
bank
.
The
man
leaned
his
frail
body
against
Watson's
shoulder
.
He
was
no
heavier
than
a
child
.
Watson
paused
for
breath
.
The
man
wheezed
weakly
,
his
fetid
breath
beating
softly
against
Watson's
neck
.
His
sweet
whisper
came
after
great
effort
.
--
Oh
,
Christ
.
I
wish
you
was
Henry
.
He
promised
to
take
me
.
--
hush
.
We're
almost
there
.
Watson
supported
the
man
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
passed
the
frail
figure
over
the
bow
of
the
nearest
skiff
.
The
man
swayed
on
a
thwart
,
turning
his
ruined
eyes
from
side
to
side
.
Watson
turned
away
,
sickened
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
.
He
heard
the
patient
voice
calling
.
--
Henry
?
?
Where
are
you
,
Henry
?
?
--
Make
him
lie
down
!
!
Watson
snatched
a
deep
breath
.
He
had
not
meant
to
shout
.
He
stood
with
his
back
to
the
skiff
.
The
men
mewed
and
scratched
,
begging
to
be
taken
away
.
Watson
spoke
bewilderedly
to
the
dark
night
flecked
with
pine-knot
torches
.
--
Goddamn
you
!
!
What
do
you
do
to
them
?
?
Intelligence
jabbed
at
him
accusingly
.
He
was
angry
,
sickened
.
He
had
not
felt
that
during
the
afternoon
.
No
,
nor
later
.
All
his
emotions
had
been
inward
,
self-conscious
.
In
war
,
on
a
night
like
this
,
it
was
only
the
outward
emotions
that
mattered
,
what
could
be
flung
out
into
the
darkness
to
damage
others
.
Yes
.
That
was
it
.
He
was
sure
of
it
.
John's
type
of
man
allowed
this
sort
of
thing
to
happen
.
What
a
fool
he
had
been
to
think
of
his
brother
!
!
So
Charles
was
dead
.
What
did
it
matter
?
?
His
name
had
been
crossed
off
a
list
.
Already
his
cool
body
lay
in
the
ground
.
What
words
had
any
meaning
?
?
What
had
he
thought
of
,
to
go
to
John
,
grovel
and
beg
understanding
?
?
To
confess
with
a
canvas
chair
as
a
prie-dieu
,
gouging
at
his
heart
until
a
rough
and
stupid
hand
bade
him
rise
and
go
?
?
Men
were
slaughtered
every
day
,
tumbled
into
eternity
like
so
many
torn
parcels
flung
down
a
portable
chute
.
What
made
him
think
John
had
a
right
to
witness
his
brother's
humiliation
?
?
What
right
had
John
to
any
special
consideration
?
?
Was
John
better
,
more
deserving
?
?
To
hell
with
John
.
Let
him
chafe
with
impatience
to
see
Charles
,
rip
open
the
note
with
trembling
hands
and
read
the
formal
report
in
Hillman's
beautiful
,
schoolmaster's
hand
.
John
would
curse
.
He
believed
that
brave
boys
didn't
cry
.
Watson
spat
on
the
ground
.
He
was
grimly
satisfied
.
He
had
stupidly
thought
himself
compelled
to
ease
his
brother's
pain
.
Now
he
knew
perfectly
that
he
had
but
longed
to
increase
his
own
suffering
.
I
would
not
want
to
be
one
of
those
writers
who
begin
each
morning
by
exclaiming
,
``
O
Gogol
,
O
Chekhov
,
O
Thackeray
and
Dickens
,
what
would
you
have
made
of
a
bomb
shelter
ornamented
with
four
plaster-of-Paris
ducks
,
a
birdbath
,
and
three
composition
gnomes
with
long
beards
and
red
mobcaps
''
?
?
As
I
say
,
I
wouldn't
want
to
begin
a
day
like
this
,
but
I
often
wonder
what
the
dead
would
have
done
.
But
the
shelter
is
as
much
a
part
of
my
landscape
as
the
beech
and
horse-chestnut
trees
that
grow
on
the
ridge
.
I
can
see
it
from
this
window
where
I
write
.
It
was
built
by
the
Pasterns
,
and
stands
on
the
acre
of
ground
that
adjoins
our
property
.
It
bulks
under
a
veil
of
thin
,
new
grass
,
like
some
embarrassing
fact
of
physicalness
,
and
I
think
Mrs.
Pastern
set
out
the
statuary
to
soften
its
meaning
.
It
would
have
been
like
her
.
She
was
a
pale
woman
.
Sitting
on
her
terrace
,
sitting
in
her
parlor
,
sitting
anywhere
,
she
ground
an
axe
of
self-esteem
.
Offer
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
she
would
say
,
``
Why
,
these
cups
look
just
like
a
set
I
gave
to
the
Salvation
Army
last
year
''
.
Show
her
the
new
swimming
pool
and
she
would
say
,
slapping
her
ankle
,
``
I
suppose
this
must
be
where
you
breed
your
gigantic
mosquitoes
''
.
Hand
her
a
chair
and
she
would
say
,
``
Why
,
it's
a
nice
imitation
of
those
Queen
Anne
chairs
I
inherited
from
Grandmother
Delancy
''
.
These
trumps
were
more
touching
than
they
were
anything
else
,
and
seemed
to
imply
that
the
nights
were
long
,
her
children
ungrateful
,
and
her
marriage
bewilderingly
threadbare
.
Twenty
years
ago
,
she
would
have
been
known
as
a
golf
widow
,
and
the
sum
of
her
manner
was
perhaps
one
of
bereavement
.
She
usually
wore
weeds
,
and
a
stranger
watching
her
board
a
train
might
have
guessed
that
Mr.
Pastern
was
dead
,
but
Mr.
Pastern
was
far
from
dead
.
He
was
marching
up
and
down
the
locker
room
of
the
Grassy
Brae
Golf
Club
shouting
,
``
Bomb
Cuba
!
!
Bomb
Berlin
!
!
Let's
throw
a
little
nuclear
hardware
at
them
and
show
them
who's
boss
''
.
He
was
brigadier
of
the
club's
locker-room
light
infantry
,
and
at
one
time
or
another
declared
war
on
Russia
,
Czechoslovakia
,
Yugoslavia
,
and
China
.
It
all
began
on
an
autumn
afternoon
--
and
who
,
after
all
these
centuries
,
can
describe
the
fineness
of
an
autumn
day
?
?
One
might
pretend
never
to
have
seen
one
before
,
or
,
to
more
purpose
,
that
there
would
never
be
another
like
it
.
The
clear
and
searching
sweep
of
sun
on
the
lawns
was
like
a
climax
of
the
year's
lights
.
Leaves
were
burning
somewhere
and
the
smoke
smelled
,
for
all
its
ammoniac
acidity
,
of
beginnings
.
The
boundless
blue
air
was
stretched
over
the
zenith
like
the
skin
of
a
drum
.
Leaving
her
house
one
late
afternoon
,
Mrs.
Pastern
stopped
to
admire
the
October
light
.
It
was
the
day
to
canvass
for
infectious
hepatitis
.
Mrs.
Pastern
had
been
given
sixteen
names
,
a
bundle
of
literature
,
and
a
printed
book
of
receipts
.
It
was
her
work
to
go
among
her
neighbors
and
collect
their
checks
.
Her
house
stood
on
a
rise
of
ground
,
and
before
she
got
into
her
car
she
looked
at
the
houses
below
.
Charity
as
she
knew
it
was
complex
and
reciprocal
,
and
almost
every
roof
she
saw
signified
charity
.
Mrs.
Balcolm
worked
for
the
brain
.
Mrs.
Ten
Eyke
did
mental
health
.
Mrs.
Trenchard
worked
for
the
blind
.
Mrs.
Horowitz
was
in
charge
of
diseases
of
the
nose
and
throat
.
Mrs.
Trempler
was
tuberculosis
,
Mrs.
Surcliffe
was
Mothers'
March
of
Dimes
,
Mrs.
Craven
was
cancer
,
and
Mrs.
Gilkson
did
the
kidney
.
Mrs.
Hewlitt
led
the
birthcontrol
league
,
Mrs.
Ryerson
was
arthritis
,
and
way
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
slate
roof
of
Ethel
Littleton's
house
,
a
roof
that
signified
gout
.
Mrs.
Pastern
undertook
the
work
of
going
from
house
to
house
with
the
thoughtless
resignation
of
an
honest
and
traditional
laborer
.
It
was
her
destiny
;
;
it
was
her
life
.
Her
mother
had
done
it
before
her
,
and
even
her
old
grandmother
,
who
had
collected
money
for
smallpox
and
unwed
mothers
.
Mrs.
Pastern
had
telephoned
most
of
her
neighbors
in
advance
,
and
most
of
them
were
ready
for
her
.
She
experienced
none
of
the
suspense
of
some
poor
stranger
selling
encyclopedias
.
Here
and
there
she
stayed
to
visit
and
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
.
The
contributions
were
ahead
of
what
she
had
got
the
previous
year
,
and
while
the
money
,
of
course
,
was
not
hers
,
it
excited
her
to
stuff
her
kit
with
big
checks
.
She
stopped
at
the
Surcliffes'
after
dusk
,
and
had
a
Scotch-and-soda
.
She
stayed
too
late
,
and
when
she
left
,
it
was
dark
and
time
to
go
home
and
cook
supper
for
her
husband
.
``
I
got
a
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
for
the
hepatitis
fund
''
,
she
said
excitedly
when
he
walked
in
.
``
I
did
everybody
on
my
list
but
the
Blevins
and
the
Flannagans
.
I
want
to
get
my
kit
in
tomorrow
morning
--
would
you
mind
doing
them
while
I
cook
the
dinner
''
?
?
``
But
I
don't
know
the
Flannagans
''
,
Charlie
Pastern
said
.
``
Nobody
does
,
but
they
gave
me
ten
last
year
''
.
He
was
tired
,
he
had
his
business
worries
,
and
the
sight
of
his
wife
arranging
pork
chops
in
the
broiler
only
seemed
like
an
extension
of
a
boring
day
.
He
was
happy
enough
to
take
the
convertible
and
race
up
the
hill
to
the
Blevins'
,
thinking
that
they
might
give
him
a
drink
.
But
the
Blevins
were
away
;
;
their
maid
gave
him
an
envelope
with
a
check
in
it
and
shut
the
door
.
Turning
in
at
the
Flannagans'
driveway
,
he
tried
to
remember
if
he
had
ever
met
them
.
The
name
encouraged
him
,
because
he
always
felt
that
he
could
handle
the
Irish
.
There
was
a
glass
pane
in
the
front
door
,
and
through
this
he
could
see
into
a
hallway
where
a
plump
woman
with
red
hair
was
arranging
flowers
.
``
Infectious
hepatitis
''
,
he
shouted
heartily
.
She
took
a
good
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
before
she
turned
and
,
walking
with
very
small
steps
,
started
toward
the
door
.
``
Oh
,
please
come
in
''
,
she
said
.
The
girlish
voice
was
nearly
a
whisper
.
She
was
not
a
girl
,
he
could
see
.
Her
hair
was
dyed
,
and
her
bloom
was
fading
,
and
she
must
have
been
crowding
forty
,
but
she
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
women
who
cling
to
the
manners
and
graces
of
a
pretty
child
of
eight
.
``
Your
wife
just
called
''
,
she
said
,
separating
one
word
from
another
,
exactly
like
a
child
.
``
And
I
am
not
sure
that
I
have
any
cash
--
any
money
,
that
is
--
but
if
you
will
wait
just
a
minute
I
will
write
you
out
a
check
if
I
can
find
my
checkbook
.
Won't
you
step
into
the
living
room
,
where
it's
cozier
''
?
?
A
fire
had
just
been
lighted
,
he
saw
,
and
things
had
been
set
out
for
drinks
,
and
,
like
any
stray
,
his
response
to
these
comforts
was
instantaneous
.
Where
was
Mr.
Flannagan
,
he
wondered
.
Travelling
home
on
a
late
train
?
?
Changing
his
clothes
upstairs
?
?
Taking
a
shower
?
?
At
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
desk
heaped
with
papers
,
and
she
began
to
riffle
these
,
making
sighs
and
and
noises
of
girlish
exasperation
.
``
I
am
terribly
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
''
,
she
said
,
``
but
won't
you
make
yourself
a
little
drink
while
you
wait
?
?
Everything's
on
the
table
''
.
``
What
train
does
Mr.
Flannagan
come
out
on
''
?
?
``
Mr.
Flannagan
is
away
''
,
she
said
.
Her
voice
dropped
.
``
Mr.
Flannagan
has
been
away
for
six
weeks
.
''
``
I'll
have
a
drink
,
then
,
if
you'll
have
one
with
me
''
.
``
If
you
will
promise
to
make
it
weak
''
.
``
Sit
down
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
enjoy
your
drink
and
look
for
your
checkbook
later
.
The
only
way
to
find
things
is
to
relax
''
.
All
in
all
,
they
had
six
drinks
.
She
described
herself
and
her
circumstances
unhesitatingly
.
Mr.
Flannagan
manufactured
plastic
tongue
depressors
.
He
travelled
all
over
the
world
.
She
didn't
like
to
travel
.
Planes
made
her
feel
faint
,
and
in
Tokyo
,
where
she
had
gone
that
summer
,
she
had
been
given
raw
fish
for
breakfast
and
so
she
had
come
straight
home
.
She
and
her
husband
had
formerly
lived
in
New
York
,
where
she
had
many
friends
,
but
Mr.
Flannagan
thought
the
country
would
be
safer
in
case
of
war
.
She
would
rather
live
in
danger
than
die
of
loneliness
and
boredom
.
She
had
no
children
;
;
she
had
made
no
friends
.
``
I've
seen
you
,
though
,
before
''
,
she
said
with
enormous
coyness
,
patting
his
knee
.
``
I've
seen
you
walking
your
dogs
on
Sunday
and
driving
by
in
the
convertible
.
''
The
thought
of
this
lonely
woman
sitting
at
her
window
touched
him
,
although
he
was
even
more
touched
by
her
plumpness
.
Sheer
plumpness
,
he
knew
,
is
not
a
vital
part
of
the
body
and
has
no
procreative
functions
.
It
serves
merely
as
an
excess
cushion
for
the
rest
of
the
carcass
.
And
knowing
its
humble
place
in
the
scale
of
things
,
why
did
he
,
at
this
time
of
life
,
seem
almost
ready
to
sell
his
soul
for
plumpness
?
?
The
remarks
she
made
about
the
sufferings
of
a
lonely
woman
seemed
so
broad
at
first
that
he
didn't
know
what
to
make
of
them
,
but
after
the
sixth
drink
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
suggested
that
they
go
upstairs
and
look
for
her
checkbook
there
.
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
she
said
later
,
when
he
was
arranging
himself
to
leave
.
Her
voice
shook
with
feeling
,
and
he
thought
it
lovely
.
He
didn't
doubt
her
truthfulness
,
although
he
had
heard
the
words
a
hundred
times
.
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
they
always
said
,
shaking
their
dresses
down
over
their
white
shoulders
.
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
they
always
said
,
waiting
for
the
elevator
in
the
hotel
corridor
.
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
they
always
said
,
pouring
another
whiskey
.
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
they
always
said
,
putting
on
their
stockings
.
On
ships
at
sea
,
on
railroad
trains
,
in
summer
hotels
with
mountain
views
,
they
always
said
,
``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
.
``
Where
have
you
been
''
?
?
Mrs.
Pastern
asked
sadly
,
when
he
came
in
.
``
It's
after
eleven
''
.
``
I
had
a
drink
with
the
Flannagans
''
.
``
She
told
me
he
was
in
Germany
''
.
``
He
came
home
unexpectedly
''
.
Charlie
ate
some
supper
in
the
kitchen
and
went
into
the
TV
room
to
hear
the
news
.
``
Bomb
them
''
!
!
He
shouted
.
``
Throw
a
little
nuclear
hardware
at
them
!
!
Show
them
who's
boss
''
!
!
But
in
bed
he
had
trouble
sleeping
.
He
thought
first
of
his
son
and
daughter
,
away
at
college
.
He
loved
them
.
It
was
the
only
meaning
of
the
word
that
he
had
ever
known
.
Then
he
played
nine
imaginary
holes
of
golf
,
choosing
his
handicap
,
his
irons
,
his
stance
,
his
opponents
,
and
his
weather
in
detail
,
but
the
green
of
the
links
seemed
faded
in
the
light
of
his
business
worries
.
His
money
was
tied
up
in
a
Nassau
hotel
,
an
Ohio
pottery
works
,
and
a
detergent
for
window-washing
,
and
luck
had
been
running
against
him
.
His
worries
harried
him
up
out
of
bed
,
and
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
went
to
the
window
.
In
the
starlight
he
could
see
the
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
.
During
the
summer
he
had
tried
to
repair
some
of
his
losses
at
the
track
,
and
the
bare
trees
reminded
him
that
his
pari-mutuel
tickets
would
still
be
lying
,
like
leaves
,
in
the
gutters
near
Belmont
and
Saratoga
.
Maple
and
ash
,
beech
and
elm
,
one
hundred
to
win
on
Three
in
the
fourth
,
fifty
to
win
on
Six
in
the
third
,
one
hundred
to
win
on
Two
in
the
eighth
.
Children
walking
home
from
school
would
scuff
through
what
seemed
to
be
his
foliage
.
Then
,
getting
back
into
bed
,
he
thought
unashamedly
of
Mrs.
Flannagan
,
planning
where
they
would
next
meet
and
what
they
would
do
.
There
are
,
he
thought
,
so
few
true
means
of
forgetfulness
in
this
life
that
why
should
he
shun
the
medicine
even
when
the
medicine
seemed
,
as
it
did
,
a
little
crude
?
?
It
was
not
as
though
she
noted
clearly
that
her
nephews
had
not
been
to
see
her
for
ten
years
,
not
since
their
last
journey
eastward
to
witness
their
Uncle
Izaak
being
lowered
into
the
rocky
soil
;
;
that
aside
from
due
notification
of
certain
major
events
in
their
lives
(
two
marriages
,
two
births
,
one
divorce
)
,
Christmas
and
Easter
cards
of
the
traditional
sort
had
been
the
only
thin
link
she
had
with
them
through
the
widowed
years
.
Her
thoughts
were
not
discrete
.
But
there
was
a
look
about
her
mouth
as
though
she
were
tasting
lemons
.
She
grasped
the
chair
arms
and
brought
her
thin
body
upright
,
like
a
bird
alert
for
flight
.
She
turned
and
walked
stiffly
into
the
parlor
to
the
dainty-legged
escritoire
,
warped
and
cracked
now
from
fifty
years
in
an
atmosphere
of
sea
spray
.
There
she
extracted
two
limp
vellum
sheets
and
wrote
off
the
letters
,
one
to
Abel
,
one
to
Mark
.
Once
her
trembling
hand
,
with
the
pen
grasped
tight
in
it
,
was
pressed
against
the
paper
the
words
came
sharply
,
smoothly
,
as
authoritatively
as
they
would
dropping
from
her
own
lips
.
And
the
stiffly
regal
look
of
them
,
she
saw
grimly
,
lacked
the
quaver
of
age
which
,
thwarting
the
efforts
of
her
amazing
will
,
ran
through
her
spoken
words
like
a
thin
ragged
string
.
``
Please
come
down
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
''
,
the
upright
letters
stalked
from
the
broad-nibbed
pen
,
``
I
have
an
important
matter
to
discuss
with
you
''
.
To
Abel
:
``
I
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
to
amuse
small
children
here
.
I
should
be
obliged
if
you
could
make
other
arrangements
for
your
daughters
.
You
may
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
,
of
course
,
but
if
arranging
for
the
care
of
the
girls
must
take
time
into
account
,
I
think
a
day
or
two
should
be
enough
to
finish
our
business
in
''
.
To
Mark
:
``
Please
give
my
regards
to
Myra
''
.
She
signed
the
letters
quickly
,
stamped
them
,
and
placed
them
on
the
hall
table
for
Raphael
to
mail
in
town
.
Then
she
went
back
to
the
wicker
chair
and
resolutely
adjusted
her
eyes
to
the
glare
on
the
water
.
``
My
nephews
will
be
coming
down
''
,
she
said
that
evening
as
Angelina
brought
her
dinner
into
the
dining
room
,
the
whole
meal
on
a
vast
linen-covered
tray
.
She
looked
at
the
girl
speculatively
from
eyes
which
had
paled
with
the
years
;
;
from
the
early
evening
lights
of
them
which
had
first
startled
Izaak
to
look
at
her
in
an
uncousinly
way
,
they
had
faded
to
a
near-absence
of
color
which
had
,
possibly
from
her
constant
looking
at
the
water
,
something
of
the
light
of
the
sea
in
them
.
Angelina
placed
the
tray
on
the
table
and
with
a
flick
of
dark
wrist
drew
off
the
cloth
.
She
smiled
,
and
the
teeth
gleamed
in
her
beautifully
modeled
olive
face
.
``
That
will
be
so
nice
for
you
,
Mrs.
Packard
''
,
she
said
.
Her
voice
was
ripe
and
full
and
her
teeth
flashed
again
in
Sicilian
brilliance
before
the
warm
curved
lips
met
and
her
mouth
settled
in
repose
.
``
Um
''
,
said
the
old
lady
,
and
brought
her
eyes
down
to
the
tray
.
``
You
remember
them
,
I
suppose
''
?
?
She
glinted
suspiciously
at
the
dish
before
her
:
``
blowfish
.
I
hope
Raphael
bought
them
whole
''
.
Angelina
stepped
back
,
her
eyes
roaming
the
tray
for
omissions
.
Then
she
looked
at
the
old
woman
again
,
her
eyes
calm
.
``
Yes
''
,
she
said
,
``
I
remember
that
they
came
here
every
summer
.
I
used
to
play
with
the
older
one
sometimes
,
when
he'd
let
me
.
Abel
''
?
?
The
name
fell
with
lazy
affectionate
remembrance
from
her
lips
.
For
an
instant
the
old
aunt
felt
something
indefinable
flash
through
her
smile
.
She
would
have
said
triumph
.
Then
Angelina
turned
and
with
an
easy
grace
walked
toward
the
kitchen
.
Jessica
Packard
lifted
her
head
and
followed
the
retreating
figure
,
her
eyes
resting
nearly
closed
on
the
unself-conscious
rise
and
fall
of
the
rounded
hips
.
For
a
moment
she
held
her
face
to
the
empty
doorway
;
;
then
she
snorted
and
groped
for
her
fork
.
There's
no
greater
catastrophe
in
the
universe
,
she
reflected
dourly
,
impaling
tender
green
beans
on
the
silver
fork
,
than
the
dwindling
away
of
a
family
.
Procreation
,
expansion
,
proliferation
--
these
are
the
laws
of
living
things
,
with
the
penalty
for
not
obeying
them
the
ultimate
in
punishments
:
oblivion
.
When
the
fate
of
the
individual
is
visited
on
the
group
,
then
(
the
warm
sweet
butter
dripped
from
her
raised
trembling
fork
and
she
pushed
her
head
forward
belligerently
)
,
ah
,
then
the
true
bitterness
of
existence
could
be
tasted
.
And
indeed
the
young
garden
beans
were
brackish
in
her
mouth
.
She
was
the
last
living
of
the
older
generation
.
What
had
once
been
a
widespread
family
--
at
one
time
,
she
knew
,
there
were
enough
Packards
to
populate
an
entire
county
--
had
now
narrowed
down
to
the
two
boys
,
Abel
and
Mark
.
She
swung
her
eyes
up
to
the
blue
of
the
window
,
her
jaws
gently
mashing
the
bitter
beans
.
What
hope
lay
in
the
nephews
,
she
asked
the
intensifying
light
out
there
,
with
one
married
to
a
barren
woman
and
the
other
divorced
,
having
sired
two
girl
children
,
with
none
to
bear
on
the
Packard
name
?
?
She
ate
.
It
seemed
to
her
,
as
it
seemed
each
night
,
that
the
gloom
drew
itself
in
and
became
densest
at
the
table's
empty
chairs
,
giving
her
the
frequent
illusion
that
she
dined
with
shadows
.
Here
,
too
,
she
talked
low
,
quirking
her
head
at
one
or
another
of
the
places
,
most
often
at
Izaak's
armchair
which
faced
her
across
the
long
table
.
Or
it
might
have
been
the
absent
nephews
she
addressed
,
consciously
playing
with
the
notion
that
this
was
one
of
the
summers
of
their
early
years
.
She
thought
again
of
her
children
,
those
two
who
had
died
young
,
before
the
later
science
which
might
have
saved
them
could
attach
even
a
label
to
their
separate
malignancies
.
The
girl
,
her
first
,
she
barely
remembered
.
It
could
have
been
anyone's
infant
,
for
it
had
not
survived
the
bassinet
.
But
the
boy
the
boy
had
been
alive
yesterday
.
Each
successive
movement
in
his
growing
was
recorded
on
the
unreeling
film
inside
her
.
He
ran
on
his
plump
sticks
of
legs
,
freezing
now
and
again
into
the
sudden
startled
attitudes
which
the
camera
had
caught
and
held
on
the
paling
photographs
,
all
carefully
placed
and
glued
and
labeled
,
resting
in
the
fat
plush
album
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
escritoire
.
In
the
cruel
clearness
of
her
memory
the
boy
remained
unchanged
,
quick
with
the
delight
of
laughter
,
and
the
pain
with
which
she
recalled
that
short
destroyed
childhood
was
still
unendurable
to
her
.
It
was
one
with
the
desolate
rocks
and
the
alien
water
on
those
days
when
she
hated
the
sea
.
The
brothers
drove
down
together
in
Mark's
small
red
sports
car
,
Mark
at
the
wheel
.
They
rarely
spoke
.
Abel
sat
and
regarded
the
farm
country
which
,
spreading
out
from
both
sides
of
the
road
,
rolled
greenly
up
to
where
the
silent
white
houses
and
long
barns
and
silos
nested
into
the
tilled
fields
.
He
saw
the
land
with
a
stranger's
eyes
,
all
the
old
familiarness
gone
.
And
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
it
would
to
any
stranger
,
impervious
,
complete
in
itself
.
There
was
stability
there
,
too
--
a
color
which
his
life
had
had
once
.
That
is
what
childhood
is
,
he
told
himself
.
Solid
,
settled
lost
.
In
the
stiff
neutral
lines
of
the
telephone
poles
he
saw
the
no-nonsense
pen
strokes
of
Aunt
Jessica's
letter
.
What
bad
grace
,
what
incredible
selfishness
he
and
Mark
had
shown
.
The
boyhood
summers
preceding
their
uncle's
funeral
might
never
have
been
.
They
had
closed
over
,
absolutely
,
with
the
sealing
of
old
Izaak's
grave
.
The
small
car
flew
on
relentlessly
.
The
old
woman
,
stubbornly
reigning
in
the
house
above
the
crashing
waters
took
on
an
ominous
reality
.
Abel
moved
and
adjusted
his
long
legs
.
``
I
suppose
it
has
to
do
with
the
property
''
,
Mark
had
said
over
the
telephone
when
they
had
discussed
their
receipt
of
the
letters
.
Not
until
the
words
had
been
spoken
did
Abel
suddenly
see
the
old
house
and
the
insistent
sea
,
and
feel
his
contrition
blotted
out
in
one
shameful
moment
of
covetousness
.
He
and
Mark
were
the
last
of
the
family
,
and
there
lay
the
Cape
Ann
property
which
had
seemed
to
have
no
end
,
stretching
from
horizon
to
horizon
,
in
those
golden
days
of
summer
.
Now
Abel
turned
his
head
to
look
at
his
brother
.
Mark
held
the
wheel
loosely
,
but
his
fingers
curved
around
it
in
a
purposeful
way
and
the
deliberate
set
of
his
body
spoke
plainly
of
the
figure
he'd
make
in
the
years
to
come
.
His
sandy
hair
was
already
beginning
to
thin
and
recede
at
the
sides
,
and
Abel
looked
quickly
away
.
Mark
easily
looked
years
older
than
himself
,
settled
,
his
world
comfortably
categorized
.
The
vacation
traffic
was
becoming
heavier
as
they
approached
the
sea
.
``
She
didn't
mention
bringing
Myra
''
,
Mark
said
,
maneuvering
the
car
into
the
next
lane
.
``
She's
probably
getting
old
--
crotchety
,
I
mean
--
and
we
figured
uh-uh
,
better
not
.
They've
never
met
,
you
know
.
But
Myra
wouldn't
budge
without
an
express
invitation
.
I
feel
kind
of
bad
about
it
''
.
He
gave
Abel
a
quick
glance
and
moved
closer
to
the
wheel
,
hugging
it
to
him
,
and
Abel
caught
this
briefest
of
allusions
to
guilt
.
``
I
imagine
the
old
girl
hasn't
missed
us
much
''
,
Mark
added
,
his
eyes
on
the
road
.
Abel
ignored
the
half-expressed
bid
for
confirmation
.
He
smiled
.
It
was
barely
possible
that
his
brother
was
right
.
He
could
tell
they
were
approaching
the
sea
.
The
air
took
on
a
special
strength
now
that
they'd
left
the
fecund
warmth
of
the
farmland
behind
.
There
was
the
smell
of
the
coast
,
like
a
primeval
memory
,
composed
of
equal
parts
salt
water
,
clams
,
seaweed
and
northern
air
.
He
turned
from
the
flying
trees
to
look
ahead
and
saw
with
an
inward
boy's
eye
again
the
great
fieldstone
house
which
,
built
on
one
of
the
many
acres
of
ancestral
land
bordering
the
west
harbor
,
had
been
Izaak's
bride-gift
to
his
cousin-wife
as
the
last
century
ended
.
Mark's
thoughts
must
have
been
keeping
silent
pace
beside
his
own
,
climbing
the
same
crags
in
dirty
white
sneakers
,
clambering
out
on
top
of
the
headland
and
coming
upon
the
sudden
glinting
water
at
the
same
instant
.
``
Remember
the
Starbird
?
?
''
Mark
asked
,
and
Abel
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
double
lines
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
the
twin
white
ribbons
which
the
car
swallowed
rapidly
as
it
ascended
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
came
down
.
``
The
Starbird
,
''
Abel
said
.
There
was
the
day
Uncle
Izaak
had
,
in
an
unexpected
grandiose
gesture
,
handed
over
the
pretty
sloop
to
Abel
for
keeps
,
on
condition
that
he
never
fail
to
let
his
brother
accompany
him
whenever
younger
the
boy
wished
.
The
two
of
them
had
developed
into
a
remarkable
sailing
team
all
of
this
happening
in
a
time
of
their
lives
when
their
youth
and
their
brotherhood
knitted
them
together
as
no
other
time
or
circumstance
could
.
They
seemed
then
to
have
had
a
single
mind
and
body
,
a
mutuality
which
had
been
accepted
with
the
fact
of
their
youth
,
casually
.
He
saw
the
Starbird
as
she
lay
,
her
slender
mast
up
and
gently
turning
,
its
point
describing
constant
languid
circles
against
a
cumulus
sky
.
Both
of
them
had
known
the
feeling
of
the
small
life
in
her
waiting
,
ready
,
for
the
two
of
them
to
run
up
her
sails
.
The
Starbird
had
been
long
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
.
They
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
sea
.
Meeting
it
without
preparation
as
they
did
,
robbed
of
anticipation
,
a
common
disappointment
seized
them
.
They
were
climbing
the
hill
in
the
night
when
the
headlights
abruptly
probed
solid
blackness
,
became
two
parallel
luminous
tubes
which
broadened
out
into
a
faint
mist
of
light
and
ended
.
Mark
stopped
the
car
and
switched
off
the
lights
and
they
sat
looking
at
the
water
,
which
,
there
being
no
moon
out
,
at
first
could
be
distinguished
from
the
sky
only
by
an
absence
of
stars
.
His
eyes
were
old
and
they
never
saw
well
,
but
heated
with
whisky
they'd
glare
at
my
noise
,
growing
red
and
raising
up
his
rage
.
I
decided
I
hated
the
Pedersen
kid
too
,
dying
in
our
kitchen
while
I
was
away
where
I
couldn't
watch
,
dying
just
to
entertain
Hans
and
making
me
go
up
snapping
steps
and
down
a
drafty
hall
,
Pa
lumped
under
the
covers
at
the
end
like
dung
covered
with
snow
,
snoring
and
whistling
.
Oh
he'd
not
care
about
the
Pedersen
kid
.
He'd
not
care
about
getting
waked
so
he
could
give
up
some
of
his
whisky
to
a
slit
of
a
kid
and
maybe
lose
one
of
his
hiding
places
in
the
bargain
.
That
would
make
him
mad
enough
if
he
was
sober
.
I
didn't
hurry
though
it
was
cold
and
the
Pedersen
kid
was
in
the
kitchen
.
He
was
all
shoveled
up
like
I
thought
he'd
be
.
I
pushed
at
his
shoulder
,
calling
his
name
.
I
think
his
name
stopped
the
snoring
but
he
didn't
move
except
to
roll
a
little
when
I
shoved
him
.
The
covers
slid
down
his
skinny
neck
so
I
saw
his
head
,
fuzzed
like
a
dandelion
gone
to
seed
,
but
his
face
was
turned
to
the
wall
--
there
was
the
pale
shadow
of
his
nose
on
the
plaster
--
and
I
thought
,
Well
you
don't
look
much
like
a
pig-drunk
bully
now
.
I
couldn't
be
sure
he
was
still
asleep
.
He
was
a
cagey
sonofabitch
.
I
shook
him
a
little
harder
and
made
some
noise
.
``
Pap-pap-pap-hey
''
,
I
said
.
I
was
leaning
too
far
over
.
I
knew
better
.
He
always
slept
close
to
the
wall
so
you
had
to
lean
to
reach
him
.
Oh
he
was
smart
.
It
put
you
off
.
I
knew
better
but
I
was
thinking
of
the
Pedersen
kid
mother-naked
in
all
that
dough
.
When
his
arm
came
up
I
ducked
away
but
it
caught
me
on
the
side
of
the
neck
,
watering
my
eyes
,
and
I
backed
off
to
cough
.
Pa
was
on
his
side
,
looking
at
me
,
his
eyes
winking
,
the
hand
that
had
hit
me
a
fist
in
the
pillow
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
of
here
''
.
I
didn't
say
anything
,
trying
to
get
my
throat
clear
,
but
I
watched
him
.
He
was
like
a
mean
horse
to
come
at
from
the
rear
.
It
was
better
,
though
,
he'd
hit
me
.
He
was
bitter
when
he
missed
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
of
here
''
.
``
Big
Hans
sent
me
.
He
told
me
to
wake
you
''
.
``
A
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
.
Get
out
of
here
''
.
``
He
found
the
Pedersen
kid
by
the
crib
''
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
''
.
Pa
pulled
at
the
covers
.
He
was
tasting
his
mouth
.
``
The
kid's
froze
good
.
Hans
is
rubbing
him
with
snow
.
He's
got
him
in
the
kitchen
''
.
``
Pedersen
''
?
?
``
No
,
Pa
.
It's
the
Pedersen
kid
.
The
kid
''
.
``
Nothing
to
steal
from
the
crib
''
.
``
Not
stealing
,
Pa
.
He
was
just
lying
there
.
Hans
found
him
froze
.
That's
where
he
was
when
Hans
found
him
''
.
Pa
laughed
.
``
I
ain't
hid
nothing
in
the
crib
''
.
``
You
don't
understand
,
Pa
.
The
Pedersen
kid
.
The
kid
''
--
``
I
goddamn
well
understand
''
.
Pa
had
his
head
up
,
glaring
,
his
teeth
gnawing
at
the
place
where
he'd
grown
a
mustache
once
.
``
I
goddamn
well
understand
.
You
know
I
don't
want
to
see
Pedersen
.
That
cock
.
Why
should
I
?
?
What
did
he
come
for
,
hey
?
?
God
dammit
,
get
.
And
don't
come
back
.
Find
out
something
.
You're
a
fool
.
Both
you
and
Hans
.
Pedersen
.
That
cock
.
Don't
come
back
.
Out
.
Out
''
.
He
was
shouting
and
breathing
hard
and
closing
his
fist
on
the
pillow
.
He
had
long
black
hairs
on
his
wrist
.
They
curled
around
the
cuff
of
his
nightshirt
.
``
Big
Hans
made
me
come
.
Big
Hans
said
''
--
``
A
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
.
He's
an
even
bigger
fool
than
you
are
.
Fat
,
hey
?
?
I
taught
him
,
dammit
,
and
I'll
teach
you
.
Out
.
You
want
me
to
drop
my
pot
''
?
?
He
was
about
to
get
up
so
I
got
out
,
slamming
the
door
.
He
was
beginning
to
see
he
was
too
mad
to
sleep
.
Then
he
threw
things
.
Once
he
went
after
Hans
and
dumped
his
pot
over
the
banister
.
Pa'd
been
shit-sick
in
that
pot
.
Hans
got
an
axe
.
He
didn't
even
bother
to
wipe
himself
off
and
he
chopped
part
of
Pa's
door
down
before
he
stopped
.
He
might
not
have
gone
that
far
if
Pa
hadn't
been
locked
in
laughing
fit
to
shake
the
house
.
That
pot
put
Pa
in
an
awful
good
humor
whenever
he
thought
of
it
.
I
always
felt
the
memory
was
present
in
both
of
them
,
stirring
in
their
chests
like
a
laugh
or
a
growl
,
as
eager
as
an
animal
to
be
out
.
I
heard
Pa
cursing
all
the
way
downstairs
.
Hans
had
laid
steaming
towels
over
the
kid's
chest
and
stomach
.
He
was
rubbing
snow
on
the
kid's
legs
and
feet
.
Water
from
the
snow
and
water
from
the
towels
had
run
off
the
kid
to
the
table
where
the
dough
was
,
and
the
dough
was
turning
pasty
,
sticking
to
the
kid's
back
and
behind
.
``
Ain't
he
going
to
wake
up
''
?
?
``
What
about
your
pa
''
?
?
``
He
was
awake
when
I
left
''
.
``
What'd
he
say
?
?
Did
you
get
the
whisky
''
?
?
``
He
said
a
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
''
.
``
Don't
be
smart
.
Did
you
ask
him
about
the
whisky
''
?
?
``
Yeah
''
.
``
Well
''
?
?
``
He
said
a
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
''
.
``
Don't
be
smart
.
What's
he
going
to
do
''
?
?
``
Go
back
to
sleep
most
likely
''
.
``
You'd
best
get
that
whisky
''
.
``
You
go
.
Take
the
axe
.
Pa's
scared
to
hell
of
axes
''
.
``
Listen
to
me
,
Jorge
,
I've
had
enough
to
your
sassing
.
This
kid's
froze
bad
.
If
I
don't
get
some
whisky
down
him
he
might
die
.
You
want
the
kid
to
die
?
?
Do
you
?
?
Well
,
get
your
pa
and
get
that
whisky
''
.
``
Pa
don't
care
about
the
kid
''
.
``
Jorge
''
.
``
Well
he
don't
.
He
don't
care
at
all
,
and
I
don't
care
to
get
my
head
busted
neither
.
He
don't
care
,
and
I
don't
care
to
have
his
shit
flung
on
me
.
He
don't
care
about
anybody
.
All
he
cares
about
is
his
whisky
and
that
dry
crack
in
his
face
.
Get
pig-drunk
--
that's
what
he
wants
.
He
don't
care
about
nothing
else
at
all
.
Nothing
.
Not
Pedersen's
kid
neither
.
That
cock
.
Not
the
kid
neither
''
.
``
I'll
get
the
spirits
''
,
Ma
said
.
I'd
wound
Big
Hans
up
tight
.
I
was
ready
to
jump
but
when
Ma
said
she'd
get
the
whisky
it
surprised
him
like
it
surprised
me
,
and
he
ran
down
.
Ma
never
went
near
the
old
man
when
he
was
sleeping
it
off
.
Not
any
more
.
Not
for
years
.
The
first
thing
every
morning
when
she
washed
her
face
she
could
see
the
scar
on
her
chin
where
he'd
cut
her
with
a
boot
cleat
,
and
maybe
she
saw
him
heaving
it
again
,
the
dirty
sock
popping
out
as
it
flew
.
It
should
have
been
nearly
as
easy
for
her
to
remember
that
as
it
was
for
Big
Hans
to
remember
going
after
the
axe
while
he
was
still
spattered
with
Pa's
yellow
sick
insides
.
``
No
you
won't
''
,
Big
Hans
said
.
``
Yes
,
Hans
,
if
they're
needed
''
,
Ma
said
.
Hans
shook
his
head
but
neither
of
us
tried
to
stop
her
.
If
we
had
,
then
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
go
instead
.
Hans
rubbed
the
kid
with
more
snow
rubbed
rubbed
.
``
I'll
get
more
snow
''
,
I
said
.
I
took
the
pail
and
shovel
and
went
out
on
the
porch
.
I
don't
know
where
Ma
went
.
I
thought
she'd
gone
upstairs
and
expected
to
hear
she
had
.
She
had
surprised
Hans
like
she
had
surprised
me
when
she
said
she'd
go
,
and
then
she
surprised
him
again
when
she
came
back
so
quick
like
she
must
have
,
because
when
I
came
in
with
the
snow
she
was
there
with
a
bottle
with
three
white
feathers
on
its
label
and
Hans
was
holding
it
angrily
by
the
throat
.
Oh
,
he
was
being
queer
and
careful
,
pawing
about
in
the
drawer
and
holding
the
bottle
like
a
snake
at
the
length
of
his
arm
.
He
was
awful
angry
because
he'd
thought
Ma
was
going
to
do
something
big
,
something
heroic
even
,
especially
for
her
I
know
him
I
know
him
we
felt
the
same
sometimes
while
Ma
wasn't
thinking
about
that
at
all
,
not
anything
like
that
.
There
was
no
way
of
getting
even
.
It
wasn't
like
getting
cheated
at
the
fair
.
They
were
always
trying
so
you
got
to
expect
it
.
Now
Hans
had
given
Ma
something
of
his
--
we
both
had
when
we
thought
she
was
going
straight
to
Pa
--
something
valuable
;
;
but
since
she
didn't
know
we'd
given
it
to
her
,
there
was
no
easy
way
of
getting
it
back
.
Hans
cut
the
foil
off
finally
and
unscrewed
the
cap
.
He
was
put
out
too
because
there
was
only
one
way
of
understanding
what
she'd
done
.
Ma
had
found
one
of
Pa's
hiding
places
.
She'd
found
one
and
she
hadn't
said
a
word
while
Big
Hans
and
I
had
hunted
and
hunted
as
we
always
did
all
winter
,
every
winter
since
the
spring
that
Hans
had
come
and
I
had
looked
in
the
privy
and
found
the
first
one
.
Pa
had
a
knack
for
hiding
.
He
knew
we
were
looking
and
he
enjoyed
it
.
But
now
Ma
.
She'd
found
it
by
luck
most
likely
but
she
hadn't
said
anything
and
we
didn't
know
how
long
ago
it'd
been
or
how
many
other
ones
she'd
found
,
saying
nothing
.
Pa
was
sure
to
find
out
.
Sometimes
he
didn't
seem
to
because
he
hid
them
so
well
he
couldn't
find
them
himself
or
because
he
looked
and
didn't
find
anything
and
figured
he
hadn't
hid
one
after
all
or
had
drunk
it
up
.
But
he'd
find
out
about
this
one
because
we
were
using
it
.
A
fool
could
see
what
was
going
on
.
If
he
found
out
Ma
found
it
--
that'd
be
bad
.
He
took
pride
in
his
hiding
.
It
was
all
the
pride
he
had
.
I
guess
fooling
Hans
and
me
took
doing
.
But
he
didn't
figure
Ma
for
much
.
He
didn't
figure
her
at
all
,
and
if
he
found
out
a
woman
it'd
be
bad
.
Hans
poured
some
in
a
tumbler
.
``
You
going
to
put
more
towels
on
him
''
?
?
``
No
''
.
``
Why
not
?
?
That's
what
he
needs
,
something
warm
to
his
skin
,
don't
he
''
?
?
``
Not
where
he's
froze
good
.
Heat's
bad
for
frostbite
.
That's
why
I
only
put
towels
on
his
chest
and
belly
.
He's
got
to
thaw
slow
.
You
ought
to
know
that
''
.
Colors
on
the
towels
had
run
.
Ma
poked
her
toe
in
the
kid's
clothes
.
``
What
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
''
?
?
Big
Hans
began
pouring
whisky
in
the
kid's
mouth
but
his
mouth
filled
without
any
getting
down
his
throat
and
in
a
second
it
was
dripping
from
his
chin
.
``
Here
,
help
me
prop
him
up
.
I
got
hold
his
mouth
open
''
.
I
didn't
want
to
touch
him
and
I
hoped
Ma
would
do
it
but
she
kept
looking
at
the
kid's
clothes
piled
on
the
floor
and
the
pool
of
water
by
them
and
didn't
make
any
move
to
.
``
Come
on
,
Jorge
''
.
``
All
right
''
.
``
Lift
,
don't
shove
lift
''
.
``
O.K.
,
I'm
lifting
''
.
I
took
him
by
the
shoulders
.
His
head
flopped
back
.
His
mouth
fell
open
.
The
skin
on
his
neck
was
tight
.
He
was
cold
all
right
.
``
Hold
his
head
up
.
He'll
choke
''
.
``
His
mouth
is
open
''
.
``
His
throat's
shut
.
He'll
choke
''
.
``
He'll
choke
anyway
''
.
``
Hold
his
head
up
''
.
``
I
can't
''
.
``
Don't
hold
him
like
that
.
Put
your
arms
around
him
''
.
``
Well
Jesus
''
.
He
was
cold
all
right
.
I
put
my
arm
carefully
around
him
.
Hans
had
his
fingers
in
the
kid's
mouth
.
``
Now
he'll
choke
for
sure
''
.
``
Shut
up
.
Just
hold
him
like
I
told
you
''
.
He
was
cold
all
right
,
and
wet
.
I
had
my
arm
behind
his
back
.
He
was
in
his
mid-fifties
at
this
time
,
long
past
the
establishment
of
his
name
and
the
wish
to
be
lionized
yet
once
again
,
and
it
was
almost
a
decade
since
he
had
sworn
off
lecturing
.
There
was
never
a
doubt
any
more
how
his
structures
would
be
received
;
;
it
was
always
the
same
unqualified
success
now
.
He
could
no
longer
build
anything
,
whether
a
private
residence
in
his
Pennsylvania
county
or
a
church
in
Brazil
,
without
it
being
obvious
that
he
had
done
it
,
and
while
here
and
there
he
was
taken
to
task
for
again
developing
the
same
airy
technique
,
they
were
such
fanciful
and
sometimes
even
playful
buildings
that
the
public
felt
assured
by
its
sense
of
recognition
after
a
time
,
a
quality
of
authentic
uniqueness
about
them
,
which
,
once
established
by
an
artist
as
his
private
vision
,
is
no
longer
disputable
as
to
its
other
values
.
Stowey
Rummel
was
internationally
famous
,
a
crafter
of
a
genuine
Americana
in
foreign
eyes
,
an
original
designer
whose
inventive
childishness
with
steel
and
concrete
was
made
even
more
believably
sincere
by
his
personality
.
He
had
lived
for
almost
thirty
years
in
this
same
stone
farmhouse
with
the
same
wife
,
a
remarkably
childish
thing
in
itself
;
;
he
rose
at
half-past
six
every
morning
,
made
himself
some
French
coffee
,
had
his
corn
flakes
and
more
coffee
,
smoked
four
cigarettes
while
reading
last
Sunday's
Herald
Tribune
and
yesterday's
Pittsburgh
Gazette
,
then
put
on
his
high-topped
farmer's
shoes
and
walked
under
a
vine
bower
to
his
workshop
.
This
was
an
enormously
long
building
whose
walls
were
made
of
rocks
,
some
of
them
brought
home
from
every
continent
during
his
six
years
as
an
oil
geologist
.
The
debris
of
his
other
careers
was
piled
everywhere
;
;
a
pile
of
wire
cages
for
mice
from
his
time
as
a
geneticist
and
a
microscope
lying
on
its
side
on
the
window
sill
,
vertical
steel
columns
wired
for
support
to
the
open
ceiling
beams
with
spidery
steel
cantilevers
jutting
out
into
the
air
,
masonry
constructions
on
the
floor
from
the
time
he
was
inventing
his
disastrous
fireplace
whose
smoke
would
pass
through
a
whole
house
,
visible
all
the
way
up
through
wire
gratings
on
each
floor
.
His
files
,
desk
,
drafting
board
and
a
high
stool
formed
the
only
clean
island
in
the
chaos
.
Everywhere
else
his
ideas
lay
or
hung
in
visible
form
:
his
models
,
drawings
,
ten-foot
canvases
in
monochromes
from
his
painting
days
,
and
underfoot
a
windfall
of
broken-backed
books
that
looked
as
though
their
insides
had
been
ransacked
by
a
maniac
.
Bicycle
gear-sets
he
had
once
used
as
the
basis
of
the
design
for
the
Camden
Cycly
Company
plant
hung
on
a
rope
in
one
corner
,
and
over
his
desk
,
next
to
several
old
and
dusty
hats
,
was
a
clean
pair
of
roller
skates
which
he
occasionally
used
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
house
.
He
worked
standing
,
with
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
as
though
he
were
merely
stopping
for
a
moment
,
sketching
with
the
surprised
stare
of
one
who
was
watching
another
person's
hand
.
Sometimes
he
would
grunt
softly
to
some
invisible
onlooker
beside
him
,
sometimes
he
would
look
stern
and
moralistic
as
his
pencil
did
what
he
disapproved
.
It
all
seemed
--
if
one
could
have
peeked
in
at
him
through
one
of
his
windows
--
as
though
this
broken-nosed
man
with
the
muscular
arms
and
wrestler's
neck
was
merely
the
caretaker
trying
his
hand
at
the
boss's
work
.
This
air
of
disengagement
carried
over
to
his
apparent
attitude
toward
his
things
,
and
people
often
mistook
it
for
boredom
in
him
or
a
surrender
to
repetitious
routine
.
But
he
was
not
bored
at
all
;
;
he
had
found
his
style
quite
early
in
his
career
and
he
thought
it
quite
wonderful
that
the
world
admired
it
,
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
alter
it
.
There
are
,
after
all
,
fortunate
souls
who
hear
everything
,
but
only
know
how
to
listen
to
what
is
good
for
them
,
and
Stowey
was
,
as
things
go
,
a
fortunate
man
.
He
left
his
home
the
day
after
New
Year's
wearing
a
mackinaw
and
sheepskin
mittens
and
without
a
hat
.
He
would
wear
this
same
costume
in
Florida
,
despite
his
wife
Cleota's
reminders
over
the
past
five
days
that
he
must
take
some
cool
clothes
with
him
.
But
he
was
too
busy
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
.
So
they
parted
when
she
was
in
an
impatient
humor
.
When
he
was
bent
over
behind
the
wheel
of
the
station
wagon
,
feeling
in
his
trouser
cuffs
for
the
ignition
key
which
he
had
dropped
a
moment
before
,
she
came
out
of
the
house
with
an
enormous
Rumanian
shawl
over
her
head
,
which
she
had
bought
in
that
country
during
one
of
their
trips
abroad
,
and
handed
him
a
clean
handkerchief
through
the
window
.
Finding
the
key
under
his
shoe
,
he
started
the
engine
,
and
while
it
warmed
up
he
turned
to
her
standing
there
in
the
dripping
fog
,
and
said
,
``
Defrost
the
refrigerator
''
.
He
saw
the
surprise
in
her
face
,
and
laughed
as
though
it
were
the
funniest
expression
he
had
ever
seen
.
He
kept
on
laughing
until
she
started
laughing
with
him
.
He
had
a
deep
voice
which
was
full
of
good
food
she
had
cooked
,
and
good
humor
;
;
an
explosive
laugh
which
always
carried
everything
before
it
.
He
would
settle
himself
into
his
seat
to
laugh
.
Whenever
he
laughed
it
was
all
he
was
doing
.
And
she
was
made
to
fall
in
love
with
him
again
there
in
the
rutted
dirt
driveway
standing
in
the
cold
fog
,
mad
as
she
was
at
his
going
away
when
he
really
didn't
have
to
,
mad
at
their
both
having
got
older
in
a
life
that
seemed
to
have
taken
no
more
than
a
week
to
go
by
.
She
was
forty-nine
at
this
time
,
a
lanky
woman
of
breeding
with
an
austere
,
narrow
face
which
had
the
distinction
of
a
steeple
or
some
architecture
that
had
been
designed
long
ago
for
a
stubborn
sort
of
prayer
.
Her
eyebrows
were
definite
and
heavy
and
formed
two
lines
moving
upward
toward
a
high
forehead
and
a
great
head
of
brown
hair
that
fell
to
her
shoulders
.
There
was
an
air
of
blindness
in
her
gray
eyes
,
the
startled-horse
look
that
ultimately
comes
to
some
women
who
are
born
at
the
end
of
an
ancestral
line
long
since
divorced
from
money-making
and
which
,
besides
,
has
kept
its
estate
intact
.
She
was
personally
sloppy
,
and
when
she
had
colds
would
blow
her
nose
in
the
same
handkerchief
all
day
and
keep
it
,
soaking
wet
,
dangling
from
her
waist
,
and
when
she
gardened
she
would
eat
dinner
with
dirt
on
her
calves
.
But
just
when
she
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
some
depravity
of
peasanthood
she
would
disappear
and
come
down
bathed
,
brushed
,
and
taking
breaths
of
air
,
and
even
with
her
broken
nails
her
hands
would
come
to
rest
on
a
table
or
a
leaf
with
a
thoughtless
delicacy
,
a
grace
of
history
,
so
to
speak
,
and
for
an
instant
one
saw
how
ferociously
proud
she
was
and
adamant
on
certain
questions
of
personal
value
.
She
even
spoke
differently
when
she
was
clean
,
and
she
was
clean
now
for
his
departure
and
her
voice
clear
and
rather
sharp
.
``
Now
drive
carefully
,
for
God's
sake
''
!
!
She
called
,
trying
to
attain
a
half
humorous
resentment
at
his
departure
.
But
he
did
not
notice
,
and
was
already
backing
the
car
down
to
the
road
,
saying
``
Toot-toot
''
!
!
To
the
stump
of
a
tree
as
he
passed
it
,
the
same
stump
which
had
impaled
the
car
of
many
a
guest
in
the
past
thirty
years
and
which
he
refused
to
have
removed
.
She
stood
clutching
her
shawl
around
her
shoulders
until
he
had
swung
the
car
onto
the
road
.
Then
,
when
he
had
it
pointed
down
the
hill
,
he
stopped
to
gaze
at
her
through
the
window
.
She
had
begun
to
turn
back
toward
the
house
,
but
his
look
caught
her
and
she
stood
still
,
waiting
there
for
what
his
expression
indicated
would
be
a
serious
word
of
farewell
.
He
looked
at
her
out
of
himself
,
she
thought
,
as
he
did
only
for
an
instant
at
a
time
,
the
look
which
always
surprised
her
even
now
when
his
uncombable
hair
was
yellowing
a
little
and
his
breath
came
hard
through
his
nicotine-choked
lungs
,
the
look
of
the
gaunt
youth
she
had
suddenly
found
herself
staring
at
in
the
Tate
Gallery
on
a
Thursday
once
.
Now
she
kept
herself
protectively
ready
to
laugh
again
and
sure
enough
he
pointed
at
her
with
his
index
finger
and
said
``
Toot
''
!
!
Once
more
and
roared
off
into
the
fog
,
his
foot
evidently
surprising
him
with
the
suddenness
with
which
it
pressed
the
accelerator
,
just
as
his
hand
did
when
he
worked
.
She
walked
back
to
the
house
and
entered
,
feeling
herself
returning
,
sensing
some
kind
of
opportunity
in
the
empty
building
.
There
is
a
death
in
all
partings
,
she
knew
,
and
promptly
put
it
out
of
her
mind
.
She
enjoyed
great
parties
when
she
would
sit
up
talking
and
dancing
and
drinking
all
night
,
but
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
being
alone
,
especially
alone
in
her
house
,
was
the
realest
part
of
life
.
Now
she
could
let
out
the
three
parakeets
without
fear
they
would
be
stepped
on
or
that
Stowey
would
let
them
out
one
of
the
doors
;
;
she
could
dust
the
plants
,
then
break
off
suddenly
and
pick
up
an
old
novel
and
read
from
the
middle
on
;
;
improvise
cha-chas
on
the
harp
;
;
and
finally
,
the
best
part
of
all
,
simply
sit
at
the
plank
table
in
the
kitchen
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
the
newspapers
,
reading
the
ads
as
well
as
the
news
,
registering
nothing
on
her
mind
but
letting
her
soul
suspend
itself
above
all
wishing
and
desire
.
She
did
this
now
,
comfortably
aware
of
the
mist
running
down
the
windows
,
of
the
silence
outside
,
of
the
dark
afternoon
it
was
getting
to
be
.
She
fell
asleep
leaning
on
her
hand
,
hearing
the
house
creaking
as
though
it
were
a
living
a
private
life
of
its
own
these
two
hundred
years
,
hearing
the
birds
rustling
in
their
cages
and
the
occasional
whirring
of
wings
as
one
of
them
landed
on
the
table
and
walked
across
the
newspaper
to
perch
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
.
Every
few
minutes
she
would
awaken
for
a
moment
to
review
things
:
Stowey
,
yes
,
was
on
his
way
south
,
and
the
two
boys
were
away
in
school
,
and
nothing
was
burning
on
the
stove
,
and
Lucretia
was
coming
for
dinner
and
bringing
three
guests
of
hers
.
Then
she
fell
asleep
again
as
soddenly
as
a
person
with
fever
,
and
when
she
awoke
it
was
dark
outside
and
the
clarity
was
back
in
her
eyes
.
She
stood
up
,
smoothing
her
hair
down
,
straightening
her
clothes
,
feeling
a
thankfulness
for
the
enveloping
darkness
outside
,
and
,
above
everything
else
,
for
the
absence
of
the
need
to
answer
,
to
respond
,
to
be
aware
even
of
Stowey
coming
in
or
going
out
,
and
yet
,
now
that
she
was
beginning
to
cook
,
she
glimpsed
a
future
without
him
,
a
future
alone
like
this
,
and
the
pain
made
her
head
writhe
,
and
in
a
moment
she
found
it
hard
to
wait
for
Lucretia
to
come
with
her
guests
.
She
went
into
the
living
room
and
turned
on
three
lamps
,
then
back
into
the
kitchen
where
she
turned
on
the
ceiling
light
and
the
switch
that
lit
the
floods
on
the
barn
,
illuminating
the
driveway
.
She
knew
she
was
feeling
afraid
and
inwardly
laughed
at
herself
.
They
were
both
so
young
,
after
all
,
so
unready
for
any
final
parting
.
How
could
it
have
been
thirty
years
already
,
she
wondered
?
?
But
yes
,
nineteen
plus
thirty
was
forty-nine
,
and
she
was
forty-nine
and
she
had
been
married
at
nineteen
.
She
stood
still
over
the
leg
of
lamb
,
rubbing
herbs
into
it
,
quite
suddenly
conscious
of
a
nausea
in
her
stomach
and
a
feeling
of
wrath
,
a
sensation
of
violence
that
started
her
shivering
.
But
they
all
said
,
``
No
,
your
time
will
come
.
Enjoy
being
a
bride
while
you
can
''
.
There
was
no
room
for
company
in
the
tiny
Weaning
House
(
where
the
Albright
boys
always
took
their
brides
,
till
they
could
get
a
house
and
a
farm
of
their
own
)
.
So
when
the
Big
House
filled
up
and
ran
over
,
the
sisters-in-law
found
beds
for
everyone
in
their
own
homes
.
And
there
was
still
not
anything
that
Linda
Kay
could
do
.
So
Linda
Kay
gave
up
asking
,
and
accepted
her
reprieve
.
Without
saying
so
,
she
was
really
grateful
;
;
for
to
attend
the
dying
was
something
she
had
never
experienced
,
and
certainly
had
not
imagined
when
she
thought
of
the
duties
she
would
have
as
Bobby
Joe's
wife
.
She
had
made
curtains
for
all
the
windows
of
her
little
house
,
and
she
had
kept
it
spotless
and
neat
,
shabby
as
it
was
,
and
cooked
good
meals
for
Bobby
Joe
.
She
had
done
all
the
things
she
had
promised
herself
she
would
do
,
but
she
had
not
thought
of
this
.
People
died
,
she
would
have
said
,
in
hospitals
,
or
in
cars
on
the
highway
at
night
.
Bobby
Joe
was
gone
all
day
now
,
not
coming
in
for
dinner
and
sometimes
not
for
supper
.
When
they
first
married
he
had
been
working
in
the
fields
all
day
,
and
she
would
get
in
the
car
and
drive
to
wherever
he
was
working
,
to
take
him
a
fresh
hot
meal
.
Now
there
was
no
work
in
the
fields
,
nor
would
there
be
till
it
rained
,
and
she
did
not
know
where
he
went
.
Not
that
she
complained
,
or
had
any
cause
to
.
Four
or
five
of
the
cousins
from
East
Texas
were
about
his
age
,
so
naturally
they
ran
around
together
.
There
was
no
reason
for
her
to
ask
what
they
did
.
Thus
a
new
pattern
of
days
began
to
develop
,
for
Granny
Albright
did
not
die
.
She
lay
still
on
the
bed
,
her
head
hardly
denting
the
pillow
;
;
sometimes
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
around
,
and
sometimes
she
took
a
little
milk
or
soup
.
They
stopped
expecting
her
to
die
the
next
minute
,
but
only
in
the
next
day
or
two
.
Those
who
had
driven
hundreds
of
miles
for
the
burial
would
not
go
home
,
for
she
might
die
any
time
;
;
but
they
might
as
well
unpack
their
suitcases
,
for
she
might
linger
on
.
So
the
pattern
was
established
.
When
Linda
Kay
had
put
up
her
breakfast
dishes
and
mopped
her
linoleum
rugs
,
she
would
go
to
the
Big
House
.
There
was
not
anything
she
could
do
there
,
but
that
was
where
everyone
was
,
or
would
be
.
Bobby
Joe
and
the
boys
would
come
by
,
say
``
How's
Granny
''
?
?
And
sit
on
the
porch
a
while
.
The
older
men
would
be
there
at
noon
,
and
maybe
rest
for
a
time
before
they
took
their
guns
off
to
the
creek
or
drove
down
the
road
towards
town
.
The
women
and
children
stayed
at
the
Albrights'
.
The
women
,
keeping
their
voices
low
as
they
worked
around
the
house
or
sat
in
the
living
room
,
sounded
like
chickens
shut
up
in
a
coop
for
the
night
.
The
children
had
to
play
away
from
the
house
(
in
the
barn
loft
or
the
pasture
behind
the
barn
)
,
to
maintain
a
proper
quietness
.
Off
and
on
,
all
day
,
someone
would
be
wiping
at
the
powdery
gray
dust
that
settled
over
everything
.
The
evaporative
cooler
had
been
moved
to
Granny's
room
,
and
her
door
was
kept
shut
;
;
so
that
the
rest
of
the
house
stayed
open
,
though
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
it
was
hotter
or
cooler
that
way
.
The
dust
clogged
their
throats
,
and
the
heat
parched
them
,
so
that
the
women
were
always
making
ice
water
.
They
had
cleaned
up
an
old
ice
box
and
begun
to
buy
fifty-pound
blocks
of
ice
in
town
,
as
the
electric
refrigerator
came
nowhere
near
providing
enough
ice
for
the
crowds
who
ate
and
drank
there
.
One
afternoon
,
as
the
women
sat
clucking
softly
,
a
new
carload
of
people
pulled
up
at
the
gate
.
It
was
a
Cadillac
,
black
grayed
with
the
dust
of
the
road
,
its
windows
closed
tight
so
you
knew
that
the
people
who
climbed
out
of
it
would
be
cool
and
unwrinkled
.
They
were
an
old
fat
couple
(
as
Linda
Kay
described
them
to
herself
)
,
a
thick
middle-aged
man
,
and
a
girl
about
ten
or
twelve
.
There
was
much
embracing
,
much
exclaiming
.
``
Cousin
Ada
!
!
Cousin
John
''
!
!
``
Cousin
Lura
''
!
!
``
Cousin
Howard
''
!
!
``
And
how
is
she
''
?
?
``
About
the
same
,
John
,
about
the
same
''
.
All
the
women
got
up
and
offered
their
chairs
,
and
when
they
were
all
seated
again
,
the
guests
made
their
inquiries
and
their
explanations
.
``
We
were
on
our
vacation
in
Canada
''
,
Howard
explained
,
in
a
muffled
voice
that
must
have
been
used
to
booming
,
``
and
the
news
didn't
catch
up
with
us
till
we
were
nearly
home
.
We
came
on
as
soon
as
we
could
''
.
There
was
the
suggestion
of
ice
water
,
and
--
in
spite
of
the
protest
``
We're
not
really
thirsty
''
--
Linda
Kay
,
to
escape
the
stuffy
air
and
the
smothering
soft
voices
,
hurried
to
the
kitchen
.
She
filled
a
big
pitcher
and
set
it
,
with
glasses
,
on
a
tray
.
Carrying
it
to
the
living
room
,
she
imagined
the
picture
she
made
:
tall
and
roundly
slim
,
a
bit
sophisticated
in
her
yellow
sheath
,
with
a
graceful
swingy
walk
that
she
had
learned
as
a
twirler
with
the
school
band
.
Almost
immediately
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
feeling
vain
,
at
such
a
time
,
in
such
a
place
,
and
she
tossed
back
her
long
yellow
hair
,
smiling
shyly
as
she
entered
the
room
.
Howard
(
the
thick
middle-aged
man
)
was
looking
at
her
.
She
felt
the
look
and
looked
back
because
she
could
not
help
it
,
seeing
that
he
was
neither
as
old
nor
as
thick
as
she
had
at
first
believed
.
``
And
who
is
this
''
?
?
He
asked
,
when
she
passed
him
a
glass
.
``
Oh
that's
Linda
Kay
''
,
Mama
Albright
said
fondly
.
``
She
married
our
baby
boy
,
Bobby
Joe
,
this
summer
''
.
``
Let's
see
''
,
Cousin
Ada
said
.
``
He's
a
right
smart
younger
than
the
rest
''
?
?
``
Oh
yes
''
,
Mama
laughed
.
``
He's
ten
years
younger
than
Ernest
.
We
didn't
expect
him
to
come
along
;
;
thought
for
the
longest
he
was
a
tumor
''
.
This
joke
was
not
funny
to
Linda
Kay
,
and
she
blushed
,
as
she
always
did
;
;
then
,
hearing
the
muffled
boom
of
Howard's
laughter
,
blushed
redder
.
``
Who
is
Howard
,
anyway
''
?
?
She
asked
Bobby
Joe
that
night
.
``
He
makes
me
uncomfortable
''
.
``
Oh
he's
a
second
cousin
or
something
.
He
got
in
the
oil
business
out
at
Odessa
and
lucked
into
some
money
''
.
``
How
old
is
he
''
?
?
``
Gosh
,
I
don't
know
.
Thirty-five
,
I
guess
.
He's
been
married
and
got
this
half-grown
kid
.
If
he
bothers
you
,
don't
pay
him
any
mind
.
He's
just
a
big
windbag
''
.
Bobby
Joe
was
thinking
about
something
else
.
``
Say
,
did
you
know
they're
fixing
to
have
a
two-day
antelope
season
on
the
Double
J
''
?
?
He
was
talking
about
antelope
again
when
they
woke
up
.
``
Listen
,
I
never
had
a
chance
to
kill
an
antelope
.
There
never
was
a
season
before
,
but
now
they
want
to
thin
'em
out
on
account
of
the
drouth
''
.
``
Did
he
ever
visit
here
when
he
was
a
kid
''
?
?
Linda
Kay
asked
.
``
Who
''
?
?
``
Howard
''
.
``
Hell
,
I
don't
know
.
When
he
was
a
kid
I
wasn't
around
''
.
Bobby
Joe
took
a
gun
from
behind
the
door
,
and
with
a
quick
``
Bye
now
''
was
gone
for
the
day
.
Almost
immediately
Howard
and
his
daughter
Debora
drove
up
in
the
Cadillac
.
``
We're
going
after
ice
''
,
Howard
said
,
``
and
thought
maybe
you'd
go
along
and
keep
us
company
''
.
There
was
really
no
reason
to
refuse
,
and
Linda
Kay
had
never
ridden
in
a
Cadillac
.
Driving
along
the
caliche-topped
road
to
town
,
Howard
talked
.
Finally
he
said
,
``
Tell
me
about
yourself
''
,
and
Linda
Kay
told
him
,
because
she
thought
herself
that
she
had
had
an
interesting
life
.
She
was
such
a
well-rounded
teenager
,
having
been
a
twirler
,
Future
Farmers
sweetheart
,
and
secretary
of
Future
Homemakers
.
In
her
sophomore
year
she
had
started
going
steady
with
Bobby
Joe
,
who
was
a
football
player
,
Future
Homemakers
sweetheart
,
and
president
of
Future
Farmers
.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
made
for
each
other
,
and
they
knew
what
they
wanted
.
Bobby
Joe
would
be
a
senior
this
year
,
and
he
planned
to
graduate
.
But
there
was
no
need
for
Linda
Kay
to
go
on
,
since
all
she
wanted
in
life
was
to
make
a
home
for
Bobby
Joe
and
(
blushing
)
raise
his
children
.
Howard
sighed
.
``
You
lucky
kids
''
,
he
said
.
``
I'd
give
anything
if
I
could
have
found
a
girl
like
you
''
.
Then
he
told
Linda
Kay
about
himself
.
Of
course
he
couldn't
say
much
,
really
,
because
of
Debora
,
but
Linda
Kay
could
imagine
what
kind
of
woman
his
wife
had
been
and
what
a
raw
deal
he
had
got
.
It
made
her
feel
different
about
Howard
.
She
was
going
to
tell
Bobby
Joe
about
how
mistaken
she
had
been
,
but
he
brought
one
of
the
cousins
home
for
supper
,
and
all
they
did
was
talk
about
antelope
.
Bobby
Joe
was
trying
to
get
Linda
Kay
to
say
she
would
cook
one
if
he
brought
it
home
.
``
Cook
a
whole
antelope
''
?
?
She
exclaimed
.
``
Why
,
I
couldn't
even
cook
a
piece
of
antelope
steak
;
;
I
never
even
saw
any
''
.
``
Oh
,
you
could
.
I
want
to
roast
the
whole
thing
,
and
have
it
for
the
boys
''
.
Linda
Kay
told
him
he
couldn't
do
anything
like
that
with
his
Grandma
dying
,
and
he
said
well
they
had
to
eat
,
didn't
they
,
they
weren't
all
dying
.
Linda
Kay
felt
like
going
off
to
the
bedroom
to
cry
;
;
but
they
were
going
up
to
the
Big
House
after
supper
,
and
she
had
to
put
on
a
clean
dress
and
fix
her
hair
a
little
.
Every
night
they
all
went
to
Mama
and
Papa
Albright's
,
and
sat
on
the
open
front
porch
,
where
they
could
get
the
breeze
.
It
was
full-of-the-moon
(
or
a
little
past
)
,
and
nearly
light
as
day
.
They
all
sat
around
and
drank
ice
water
,
and
the
men
smoked
,
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
.
Once
in
a
while
they
said
what
a
shame
it
was
,
with
Granny
dying
,
but
they
all
agreed
she
wouldn't
have
wanted
it
any
other
way
.
That
night
the
older
men
got
to
talking
about
going
possum-hunting
on
a
moonlight
night
.
Bobby
Joe
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
boys
declared
they
had
never
been
possum-hunting
,
and
Uncle
Bill
Farnworth
(
from
Mama
Albright's
side
of
the
family
)
said
he
would
just
get
up
from
there
and
take
them
,
right
then
.
After
they
had
left
,
some
of
the
people
moved
around
,
to
find
more
comfortable
places
to
sit
.
There
were
not
many
chairs
,
so
that
some
preferred
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
,
resting
their
feet
on
the
ground
,
and
others
liked
to
sit
where
they
could
lean
back
against
the
wall
.
Howard
,
who
had
been
sitting
against
the
wall
,
said
he
needed
more
fresh
air
,
and
took
the
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
where
Bobby
Joe
had
been
sitting
.
``
You'll
be
a
darn
sight
more
comfortable
there
,
Howard
''
,
Ernest
said
,
laughing
,
and
they
all
laughed
.
Linda
Kay
felt
that
she
was
not
exactly
more
comfortable
.
Bobby
Joe
had
been
sitting
close
to
her
,
touching
her
actually
,
and
holding
her
hand
from
time
to
time
,
but
it
seemed
at
once
that
Howard
sat
much
closer
.
Perhaps
it
was
just
that
he
had
so
much
more
flesh
,
so
that
more
of
it
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
hers
;
;
but
she
had
never
been
so
aware
of
anyone's
flesh
before
.
Still
she
was
not
sorry
he
sat
by
her
,
but
in
fact
was
flattered
.
He
had
become
the
center
of
the
company
,
such
stories
he
had
to
tell
.
He
had
sold
oil
stock
to
Bob
Hope
and
Bing
Crosby
in
person
;
;
he
had
helped
fight
an
oil-well
fire
that
raged
six
days
and
nights
.
``
But
tell
me
,
doctor
,
where
do
you
plan
to
conduct
the
hatching
''
?
?
Alex
asked
.
``
That
will
have
to
be
in
the
hotel
''
,
the
doctor
retorted
,
confirming
Alex's
anticipations
.
``
What
I
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
market
with
me
early
tomorrow
morning
and
help
smuggle
the
hen
back
into
the
hotel
''
.
The
doctor
paid
the
bill
and
they
repaired
to
the
hotel
,
room
number
nine
,
to
initiate
Alex
further
into
these
undertakings
.
The
doctor
opened
the
smallest
of
his
cases
,
an
unimposing
straw
bag
,
and
exposed
the
contents
for
Alex's
inspection
.
Inside
,
carefully
packed
in
straw
,
were
six
eggs
,
but
the
eye
of
a
poultry
psychologist
was
required
to
detect
what
scientifically
valuable
specimentalia
lay
inside
;
;
to
Alex
they
were
merely
six
not
unusual
hens'
eggs
.
There
was
little
enough
time
to
contemplate
them
,
however
;
;
in
an
instant
the
doctor
was
stalking
across
the
room
with
an
antique
ledger
in
his
hands
,
thoroughly
eared
and
big
as
a
table
top
.
He
placed
it
on
Alex's
lap
.
``
This
is
my
hen
ledger
''
,
he
informed
him
in
an
absorbed
way
.
``
It's
been
going
since
1908
when
I
was
a
junior
in
college
.
That
first
entry
there
is
the
Vermont
Flumenophobe
,
the
earliest
and
one
of
the
most
successful
of
my
eighty-three
varieties
--
great
big
scapulars
and
hardly
any
primaries
at
all
.
Couldn't
take
them
near
a
river
,
though
,
or
they'd
squawk
like
a
turkey
cock
the
day
before
Thanksgiving
''
.
The
ledger
was
full
of
most
precise
information
:
date
of
laying
,
length
of
incubation
period
,
number
of
chick
reaching
the
first
week
,
second
week
,
fifth
week
,
weight
of
hen
,
size
of
rooster's
wattles
and
so
on
,
all
scrawled
out
in
a
hand
that
looked
more
Chinese
than
English
,
the
most
jagged
and
sprawling
Alex
had
ever
seen
.
Below
these
particulars
was
a
series
of
alpha-beta-gammas
connected
by
arrows
and
crosses
which
denoted
the
lineage
of
the
breed
.
Alex's
instruction
was
rapid
,
for
the
doctor
had
to
go
off
to
the
Rue
Ecole
De
Medecine
to
hear
more
speeches
with
only
time
for
one
sip
of
wine
to
sustain
him
through
them
all
.
But
after
the
doctor's
return
that
night
Alex
could
see
,
from
the
high
window
in
his
own
room
,
the
now
familiar
figure
crouched
on
a
truly
impressive
heap
of
towels
,
apparently
giving
its
egg-hatching
powers
one
final
chance
before
it
was
replaced
in
its
office
by
a
sure-enough
hen
.
A
knocking
at
Alex's
door
roused
him
at
six
o'clock
the
following
morning
.
It
was
the
doctor
,
dressed
and
ready
for
the
expedition
to
the
market
,
and
Alex
was
obliged
to
prepare
himself
in
haste
.
The
doctor
stood
about
,
waiting
for
Alex
to
dress
,
with
a
show
of
impatience
,
and
soon
they
were
moving
,
as
quietly
as
could
be
,
through
the
still-dark
hallways
,
past
the
bedroom
of
the
patronne
,
and
so
into
the
street
.
The
market
was
not
far
and
,
once
there
,
the
doctor's
sense
of
immediacy
left
him
and
he
fell
into
a
state
of
harmony
with
the
birds
around
him
.
He
stroked
the
hens
and
they
responded
with
delighted
clucks
,
he
gobbled
with
the
turkeys
and
they
at
once
were
all
attention
,
he
quacked
with
the
ducks
,
and
cackled
with
a
pair
of
exceedingly
flattered
geese
.
The
dawn
progressed
and
it
seemed
that
the
doctor
would
never
be
done
with
his
ministrations
when
quite
abruptly
something
broke
his
revery
.
It
was
a
fine
broody
hen
,
white
,
with
a
maternal
eye
and
a
striking
abundance
of
feathers
in
the
under
region
of
the
abdomen
.
The
doctor
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
professional
interests
have
found
scope
,
drew
Alex's
attention
to
those
excellences
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
him
:
the
fine
color
in
comb
and
wattles
,
the
length
and
quality
of
neck
and
saddle
hackles
,
the
firm
,
wide
spread
of
the
toes
,
and
a
rare
justness
in
the
formation
of
the
ear
lappets
.
All
search
was
ended
;
;
he
had
found
his
fowl
.
The
purchase
was
effected
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
hotel
again
,
the
hen
,
with
whom
some
sort
of
communication
had
been
set
up
,
nestling
in
the
doctor's
arms
.
The
clocks
struck
seven-thirty
as
they
approached
the
hotel
entrance
;
;
and
hopes
that
the
chambermaid
and
patronne
would
still
be
abed
began
to
rise
in
Alex's
well
exercised
breast
.
The
doctor
was
wearing
a
long
New
England
greatcoat
,
hardly
necessary
in
the
June
weather
but
a
garment
which
proved
well
adapted
to
the
sequestration
of
hens
.
Alex
entered
first
and
was
followed
by
the
doctor
who
,
for
all
his
care
,
manifested
a
perceptible
bulge
on
his
left
side
where
the
hen
was
cradled
.
They
advanced
in
a
line
across
the
entrance
hall
to
the
stairway
and
up
,
with
gingerly
steps
,
towards
the
first
landing
.
It
was
then
that
they
heard
the
tread
of
one
descending
and
,
in
some
perturbation
glancing
up
,
saw
the
patronne
coming
towards
them
as
they
gained
the
landing
.
``
Bonjour
,
messieurs
,
vous
etes
matinals
''
,
she
greeted
them
pleasantly
.
Alex
explained
that
they
had
been
out
for
a
stroll
before
breakfast
while
the
doctor
edged
around
behind
him
,
attempting
to
hide
the
protuberance
at
his
left
side
behind
Alex's
arm
and
back
.
``
Vous
voulez
vos
petits
dejeuners
tout
de
suite
alors
''
?
?
Their
hostess
enquired
.
Alex
told
her
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
their
breakfasts
,
trying
at
the
same
time
to
effect
a
speedy
separation
of
the
persons
before
and
behind
him
.
The
doctor
,
he
noticed
,
was
attempting
a
transverse
movement
towards
the
stairs
,
but
before
the
movement
could
be
completed
a
distinct
and
audible
cluck
ruffled
the
air
in
the
hollow
of
the
stair-well
.
Eyes
swerved
in
the
patronne's
head
,
Alex
coughed
loudly
,
and
the
doctor
,
with
a
sforzando
of
chicken
noises
floating
behind
him
,
took
to
the
stairs
in
long-shanked
leaps
.
``
Comment
''
?
?
Ejaculated
the
surprised
woman
,
looking
at
Alex
for
an
explanation
but
he
,
parting
from
her
without
ceremony
,
only
offered
a
few
words
about
the
doctor's
provincial
American
speech
and
a
state
of
nerves
brought
on
by
the
demands
of
his
work
.
With
that
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
,
followed
by
her
suspicious
gaze
.
When
Alex
entered
his
room
,
the
doctor
was
already
preparing
a
nest
in
the
straw
case
,
six
eggs
ready
for
the
hen's
attentions
.
There
was
no
reference
to
the
incident
on
the
stairs
,
his
powers
being
absorbed
by
this
more
immediate
business
.
The
hen
appeared
to
have
no
doubts
as
to
her
duties
and
was
quick
to
settle
down
to
the
performance
of
them
.
One
part
of
her
audience
was
totally
engaged
,
the
connoisseur
witnessing
a
peculiarly
fine
performance
of
some
ancient
classic
,
the
other
part
,
the
guest
of
the
connoisseur
,
attentive
as
one
who
must
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
that
which
he
does
not
fully
understand
.
The
spectacle
progressed
towards
a
denouement
which
was
obviously
still
remote
;
;
the
audience
attended
.
Time
elapsed
but
the
doctor
was
obviously
unconscious
of
its
passage
until
an
unwelcome
knock
on
the
door
interrupted
the
processes
of
nature
.
Startled
,
he
jumped
up
to
pull
hen
and
case
out
of
view
,
and
Alex
went
to
the
door
.
He
opened
it
a
crack
and
in
doing
so
made
as
much
shuffling
,
coughing
,
and
scraping
noise
as
possible
in
order
to
drown
emanations
from
the
hen
who
had
begun
to
protest
.
It
was
Giselle
,
the
fille
de
chambre
,
come
to
clean
the
room
,
and
while
she
stood
before
him
with
ears
pricked
up
and
regard
all
curiosity
,
explaining
her
errand
,
Alex
could
see
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
doctor
doing
all
he
could
to
calm
the
displeased
bird
.
Giselle
was
reluctant
but
Alex
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
come
back
in
five
minutes
and
the
door
was
shut
again
.
``
Who
was
that
,
young
feller
''
?
?
The
doctor
instantly
asked
.
``
That
was
the
fille
de
chambre
,
the
one
you
thought
couldn't
get
the
eggs
out
.
She
looked
mighty
interested
,
though
.
Anyhow
she's
coming
back
in
five
minutes
to
do
the
room
''
.
The
doctor's
mind
was
working
at
a
great
speed
;
;
he
rose
to
put
his
greatcoat
on
and
addressed
Alex
in
a
muted
voice
.
``
Have
you
got
our
keys
handy
''
?
?
``
Right
in
my
pocket
''
.
``
All
right
.
Now
you
go
outside
and
beckon
me
when
it's
safe
''
.
The
hall
was
empty
and
Alex
beckoned
;
;
they
climbed
the
stairs
which
creaked
,
very
loudly
to
their
sensitive
ears
,
and
reached
the
next
floor
.
A
guest
was
locking
his
room
;
;
they
passed
behind
him
and
got
to
Alex's
room
unnoticed
.
The
doctor
sat
down
rather
wearily
,
caressing
the
hen
and
remarking
that
the
city
was
not
the
place
for
a
poultry-loving
man
,
but
no
sooner
was
the
remark
out
than
a
knock
at
this
door
obliged
him
to
cover
the
hen
with
his
greatcoat
once
more
.
At
the
door
Alex
managed
to
persuade
the
increasingly
astonished
fille
de
chambre
to
return
in
ten
minutes
.
It
was
evident
that
a
second
transfer
had
to
be
effected
,
and
that
it
had
to
take
place
between
the
time
the
fille
finished
the
doctor's
room
and
the
time
she
began
Alex's
.
They
waited
three
minutes
and
then
crept
out
on
tip-toe
;
;
the
halls
were
empty
and
they
passed
down
the
stairs
to
number
nine
and
listened
at
the
door
.
A
bustle
of
sheets
being
smoothed
and
pillows
being
arranged
indicated
the
fille
de
chambre's
presence
inside
;
;
they
listened
and
suddenly
a
step
towards
the
door
announced
another
important
fact
.
The
doctor
shot
down
to
the
lavatory
and
turned
the
doorknob
,
but
to
no
effect
:
the
lavatory
was
occupied
.
Although
a
look
of
alarm
passed
over
his
face
,
he
did
not
arrest
his
movements
but
disappeared
into
the
shower
room
just
as
the
chambermaid
emerged
from
number
nine
.
Alex
suppressed
those
expressions
of
relief
which
offered
to
prevail
in
his
face
and
escape
from
his
throat
;
;
unwarranted
they
were
in
any
case
for
,
as
he
stood
facing
the
fille
de
chambre
,
his
ears
were
assailed
by
new
sounds
from
the
interior
of
the
shower
room
.
The
events
of
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
,
mysterious
to
any
bird
accustomed
only
to
the
predictable
life
of
coop
and
barnyard
,
had
overcome
the
doctor's
hen
and
she
gave
out
a
series
of
cackly
wails
,
perhaps
mourning
her
nest
,
but
briefly
enjoyed
.
The
doctor's
wits
had
not
left
him
,
however
,
for
all
his
sixty-eight
years
,
and
the
wails
were
almost
immediately
lost
in
the
sound
of
water
rushing
out
from
the
showerhead
.
Alex
nodded
to
the
maid
as
though
nothing
unusual
were
taking
place
and
entered
the
doctor's
room
.
Shortly
,
the
doctor
himself
entered
,
his
hair
somewhat
wet
from
the
shower
,
but
evidently
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
their
adventures
.
Without
comment
he
opened
the
closet
and
from
its
shelves
constructed
a
highboard
around
the
egg
case
which
he
had
placed
on
the
floor
inside
.
Next
,
the
hen
was
nested
and
all
seemed
well
.
The
two
men
sat
for
some
time
,
savoring
the
pleasure
of
escape
from
peril
and
the
relief
such
escape
brings
,
before
they
got
up
and
left
the
hotel
,
the
doctor
to
go
to
the
conference
house
and
Alex
to
go
to
the
main
post
office
.
Alex
returned
to
the
hotel
,
rather
weary
and
with
no
new
prospects
of
a
role
,
in
the
late
afternoon
,
but
found
the
doctor
in
an
ebullient
mood
.
At
the
time
Alex
arrived
he
was
engaged
in
some
sort
of
intimate
communication
with
the
hen
,
who
had
settled
herself
on
the
nest
most
peacefully
after
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
.
``
Chickens
have
short
memories
''
,
the
doctor
remarked
,
``
that's
why
they
are
better
company
than
most
people
I
know
''
,
and
he
went
on
to
break
some
important
news
to
Alex
.
``
Well
''
,
he
began
,
``
It
seems
like
some
people
in
Paris
want
to
hear
more
from
me
than
those
fellers
over
at
the
conference
house
do
.
They've
got
a
big
vulture
from
Tanganika
at
the
zoo
here
,
with
a
wife
for
him
,
too
,
very
rare
birds
,
both
of
them
,
the
only
Vulturidae
of
their
species
outside
Africa
.
Seems
like
she's
willing
,
but
the
male
just
flops
around
all
day
like
the
bashful
boy
who
took
Jeannie
May
behind
the
barn
and
then
didn't
know
what
to
do
,
and
the
people
at
the
zoo
haven't
got
any
vulture
chicks
to
show
for
their
trouble
.
Going
downstairs
with
the
tray
,
Winston
wished
he
could
have
given
in
to
Miss
Ada
,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
do
what
she
said
when
she
had
that
little-girl
look
.
There
were
times
it
wasn't
right
to
make
a
person
happy
,
like
the
times
she
came
in
the
kitchen
and
asked
know
we
don't
keep
peanut
``
butter
for
a
peanut
butter
sandwich
.
You
in
this
house
''
,
he
always
told
her
.
``
Why
,
Winston
''
,
she'd
cry
,
``
I
just
now
saw
you
eating
it
out
of
the
jar
''
!
!
But
he
knew
how
important
it
was
for
her
to
keep
her
figure
.
In
the
kitchen
,
Leona
,
his
little
young
wife
,
was
reading
the
morning
paper
.
Her
legs
hung
down
long
and
thin
as
she
sat
on
the
high
stool
.
``
Here
''
,
Winston
said
gently
,
``
what's
these
dishes
doing
not
washed
''
?
?
The
enormous
plates
which
had
held
Mr.
Jack's
four
fried
eggs
and
five
strips
of
bacon
were
still
stacked
in
the
sink
.
``
Leave
me
alone
''
,
Leona
said
.
``
Can't
you
see
I'm
busy
''
?
?
She
looked
at
him
impudently
over
the
corner
of
the
paper
.
``
This
is
moving
day
''
,
Winston
reminded
her
,
``
and
I
bet
you
left
things
every
which
way
upstairs
,
your
clothes
all
over
the
floor
and
the
bed
not
made
.
Leona
''
!
!
His
eye
had
fastened
on
her
leg
;
;
bending
,
he
touched
her
knee
.
``
If
I
catch
you
one
more
time
down
here
without
stockings
''
--
She
twitched
her
leg
away
.
``
Fuss
,
fuss
,
old
man
''
.
She
had
an
alley
cat's
manners
.
Winston
stacked
Miss
Ada's
thin
pink
dishes
in
the
sink
.
Then
he
spread
out
the
last
list
on
the
counter
.
``
To
Be
Left
Behind
''
was
printed
at
the
top
in
Miss
Ada
;
;
fine
hand
.
Winston
took
out
a
pencil
,
admired
the
point
,
and
wrote
slowly
and
heavily
,
``
Clothes
Stand
''
.
Sighing
,
Leona
dropped
the
paper
and
stood
up
.
``
I
guess
I
better
get
ready
to
go
''
.
Winston
watched
her
fumbling
to
untie
her
apron
.
``
Here
''
.
Carefully
,
he
undid
the
bow
.
``
How
come
your
bows
is
always
cockeyed
''
?
?
She
turned
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
.
``
I
don't
want
to
leave
here
,
Winston
''
.
``
Now
listen
to
that
''
.
He
drew
back
,
embarrassed
and
pleased
.
``
I
thought
you
was
sick
to
death
of
this
big
house
.
Said
you
wore
yourself
out
,
cleaning
all
these
empty
rooms
''
.
``
At
least
there
is
room
here
''
,
she
said
.
``
What
room
is
there
going
to
be
in
an
apartment
for
any
child
''
?
?
``
I
told
you
what
Miss
Ada's
doctor
said
''
.
``
I
don't
mean
Miss
Ada
!
!
What
you
think
I
care
about
that
?
?
I
mean
our
children
''
.
She
sounded
as
though
they
already
existed
.
In
spite
of
the
hundred
things
he
had
on
his
mind
,
Winston
went
and
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
.
``
We've
got
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
that
.
All
the
time
in
the
world
.
We've
only
been
married
four
years
,
January
''
.
``
Four
years
''
!
!
She
wailed
.
``
That's
a
long
time
,
waiting
''
.
``
How
many
times
have
I
told
you
''
--
he
began
,
and
was
almost
glad
when
she
cut
him
off
--
``
Too
many
times
''
!
!
--
and
flounced
to
the
sink
,
where
she
began
noisily
to
wash
her
hands
.
Too
many
times
was
the
truth
of
it
,
Winston
thought
.
He
hardly
believed
his
reason
himself
any
more
.
Although
it
had
seemed
a
good
reason
,
to
begin
with
:
no
couple
could
afford
to
have
children
.
``
How
you
going
to
work
with
a
child
hanging
on
you
''
?
?
He
asked
Leona
.
``
You
want
to
keep
this
job
,
don't
you
''
?
?
He
doubted
whether
she
heard
him
,
over
the
running
water
.
He
sat
for
a
while
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
watching
the
bend
of
her
back
as
she
gathered
up
her
things
--
a
comb
,
a
bottle
of
aspirin
--
to
take
upstairs
and
pack
.
She
made
him
sad
some
days
,
and
he
was
never
sure
why
;
;
it
was
something
to
do
with
her
back
,
the
thinness
of
it
,
and
the
quick
,
jerky
way
she
bent
.
She
was
too
young
,
that
was
all
;
;
too
young
and
thin
and
straight
.
``
Winston
''
!
!
It
was
Mr.
Jack
,
bellowing
out
in
the
hall
.
Winston
hurried
through
the
swinging
door
.
``
I've
been
bursting
my
lungs
for
you
''
,
Mr.
Jack
complained
.
He
was
standing
in
front
of
the
mirror
,
tightening
his
tie
.
He
had
on
his
gray
tweed
overcoat
and
his
city
hat
,
and
his
brief
case
lay
on
the
bench
.
``
I
don't
know
what
you
think
you've
been
doing
about
my
clothes
''
,
he
said
.
``
This
coat
looks
like
a
rag
heap
''
.
There
were
a
few
blades
of
lint
on
the
shoulder
.
Winston
took
the
clothesbrush
out
of
the
closet
and
went
to
work
.
He
gave
Mr.
Jack
a
real
going-over
;
;
he
brushed
his
shoulders
and
his
back
and
his
collar
with
long
,
firm
strokes
.
``
Hey
''
!
!
Mr.
Jack
cried
when
the
brush
tipped
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
.
Winston
apologized
and
quickly
set
the
hat
right
.
Then
he
stood
back
to
look
at
Mr.
Jack
,
who
was
pulling
on
his
pigskin
gloves
.
Winston
enjoyed
seeing
him
start
out
;
;
he
wore
his
clothes
with
style
.
When
he
was
going
to
town
,
nothing
was
good
enough
--
he
had
cursed
at
Winston
once
for
leaving
a
fleck
of
polish
on
his
shoelace
.
At
home
,
he
wouldn't
even
wash
his
hands
for
supper
,
and
he
wandered
around
the
yard
in
a
pair
of
sweaty
old
corduroys
.
The
velvet
smoking
jackets
,
pearl-gray
,
wine
,
and
blue
,
which
Miss
Ada
had
bought
him
hung
brushed
and
unworn
in
the
closet
.
``
Good-by
,
Winston
''
,
Mr.
Jack
said
,
giving
a
final
set
to
his
hat
.
``
Look
out
for
those
movers
''
!
!
Winston
watched
him
hurry
down
the
drive
to
his
car
;
;
a
handsome
,
fine-looking
man
it
made
him
proud
to
see
.
After
Mr.
Jack
drove
away
,
Winston
went
on
looking
out
the
window
.
He
noticed
a
speck
of
dirt
on
the
sill
and
swiped
at
it
with
his
finger
.
Then
he
looked
at
his
finger
,
at
the
wrinkled
,
heavy
knuckle
and
the
thick
nail
he
used
like
a
knife
to
pry
up
,
slit
,
and
open
.
For
the
first
time
,
he
be
sad
about
the
move
.
That
house
was
ten
years
off
his
life
let
himself
.
Each
brass
handle
and
hinge
shone
for
his
reward
,
and
he
knew
how
to
get
at
the
dust
in
the
china
flowers
and
how
to
take
down
the
long
glass
drops
which
hung
from
the
chandelier
.
He
knew
the
house
like
a
blind
man
,
through
his
fingers
,
and
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
all
the
time
and
rags
and
polishes
he
had
spent
on
keeping
it
up
.
Ten
years
ago
,
he
had
come
to
the
house
to
be
interviewed
.
The
tulips
and
the
big
pink
peonies
had
been
blooming
along
the
drive
,
and
he
had
walked
up
from
the
bus
almost
singing
.
Miss
Ada
had
been
out
back
,
in
a
straw
hat
,
planting
flowers
.
She
had
talked
to
him
right
there
,
with
the
hot
sun
in
his
face
,
which
made
him
sweat
and
feel
ashamed
.
Winston
had
been
surprised
at
her
for
that
.
Still
,
he
had
liked
the
way
she
had
looked
,
in
a
fresh
,
neat
cotton
dress
--
citron
yellow
,
if
he
remembered
.
She
had
had
a
dignity
about
her
,
even
barefoot
and
almost
too
tan
.
Since
then
,
the
flowers
she
had
planted
had
spread
all
over
the
hill
.
Already
the
jonquils
were
blooming
in
a
flock
by
the
front
gate
,
and
the
periwinkles
were
coming
on
,
blue
by
the
porch
steps
.
In
a
week
the
hyacinths
would
spike
out
.
And
the
dogwood
in
early
May
,
for
Miss
Ada's
alfresco
party
;
;
and
after
that
the
Japanese
cherries
.
Now
the
yard
looked
wet
and
bald
,
the
trees
bare
under
their
buds
,
but
in
a
while
Miss
Ada's
flowers
would
bloom
like
a
marching
parade
.
She
had
dug
a
hole
for
each
bulb
,
each
tree
wore
a
tag
with
her
writing
on
it
;
;
where
would
she
go
for
her
gardening
now
?
?
Somehow
Winston
didn't
think
she'd
take
to
window
boxes
.
Sighing
,
he
hurried
to
the
living
room
.
He
had
a
thousand
things
to
see
to
.
Still
,
he
couldn't
help
thinking
,
we're
all
getting
old
,
getting
small
;
;
the
snail
is
pulling
in
her
horns
.
In
the
living
room
,
Miss
Ada
was
standing
by
the
window
with
a
sheaf
of
lists
in
her
hand
.
She
was
looking
out
at
the
garden
.
``
Winston
''
,
she
said
,
``
get
the
basket
for
the
breakables
''
.
Winston
had
the
big
straw
basket
ready
in
the
hall
.
He
brought
it
in
and
put
it
down
beside
her
.
Miss
Ada
was
looking
fine
;
;
she
had
on
her
Easter
suit
,
blue
,
with
lavender
binding
.
Halfway
across
the
house
,
he
could
have
smelled
her
morning
perfume
.
It
hung
in
all
her
day
clothes
,
sweet
and
strong
;
;
sometimes
when
he
was
pressing
,
Winston
raised
her
dresses
to
his
face
.
Frowning
,
Miss
Ada
studied
the
list
.
``
Well
,
let's
see
.
The
china
lemon
tree
.
The
alabaster
cockatoo
''
.
Winston
followed
her
around
the
room
,
collecting
the
small
frail
objects
(
Christmas
,
birthday
,
and
anniversary
)
and
wrapping
them
in
tissue
paper
.
Neither
of
them
trusted
the
movers
.
When
they
came
to
Mr.
Jack's
photograph
,
twenty
by
twelve
inches
in
a
curly
silver
frame
,
Miss
Ada
said
,
``
By
rights
I
ought
to
leave
that
,
seeing
he
won't
take
my
clotheshorse
''
.
She
smiled
at
Winston
,
and
he
saw
the
hateful
hard
glitter
in
her
eyes
.
He
picked
up
the
photograph
and
began
to
wrap
it
.
``
At
least
you
could
leave
it
for
the
movers
''
,
Miss
Ada
said
.
``
What
possessed
you
to
tell
me
a
clotheshorse
would
be
a
good
idea
''
?
?
Winston
folded
the
tissue
paper
carefully
.
``
He's
used
it
every
day
;
;
every
morning
,
I
lay
out
his
clothes
on
it
''
.
``
Well
,
that's
over
now
.
And
it
was
his
main
present
!
!
Leave
that
fool
picture
out
''
,
she
added
sharply
.
Winston
laid
it
in
the
basket
.
``
Mr.
Jack
sets
store
by
that
''
.
``
Really
,
Winston
.
It
was
meant
to
be
my
present
''
.
But
she
went
on
down
the
list
.
Winston
was
relieved
;
;
those
presents
had
been
on
his
mind
.
He
had
only
agreed
with
Miss
Ada
about
getting
the
valet
,
but
he
had
actually
suggested
the
photograph
to
Mr.
Jack
.
``
You
know
what
she
likes
,
Winston
''
,
he
had
said
wearily
,
one
evening
in
November
when
Winston
was
pulling
off
his
overshoes
.
``
Tell
me
what
to
get
her
for
Christmas
''
.
``
She's
been
talking
about
a
picture
''
,
Winston
had
told
him
.
``
Picture
!
!
You
mean
picture
of
me
''
?
?
But
Winston
had
persuaded
him
.
On
Christmas
night
,
they
had
had
a
disagreement
about
it
.
Winston
had
heard
because
he
was
setting
up
the
liquor
tray
in
the
next
room
.
Through
the
door
,
he
had
seen
Mr.
Jack
walking
around
,
waiting
for
Miss
Ada
.
Finally
she
had
come
down
;
;
Winston
had
heard
her
shaking
out
the
skirt
of
her
new
pink
silk
hostess
gown
.
``
How
do
you
like
it
''
?
?
She
had
asked
.
Mr.
Jack
had
said
,
``
You
look
about
fifteen
years
old
''
.
``
Is
that
a
compliment
''
?
?
``
I
don't
know
''
.
He
had
stood
at
a
little
distance
,
studying
her
,
as
though
he
would
walk
around
next
and
look
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
``
Lovie
,
you
make
me
feel
naked
''
.
Miss
Ada
had
giggled
,
and
she
went
sweeping
and
rustling
to
the
couch
and
sank
down
.
``
You
look
like
that
picture
I
have
at
the
office
''
,
Mr.
Jack
had
started
.
``
Not
a
line
,
not
a
wrinkle
.
I
look
like
an
old
man
,
compared
''
,
and
he
had
picked
up
his
photograph
with
the
red
Christmas
bow
still
on
it
.
``
Look
,
an
old
man
.
Will
you
wear
pink
when
you're
sixty
''
?
?
``
Darling
,
I
love
that
photograph
.
I'm
going
to
put
it
on
my
dresser
''
.
``
I
guess
it's
children
make
a
woman
old
.
A
man
gets
old
anyhow
''
.
After
a
minute
he
went
on
,
``
People
must
think
the
curse
is
on
me
,
seeing
you
fresh
as
an
apple
and
me
old
and
gray
''
.
``
I'll
give
you
a
medical
certificate
,
framed
,
if
you
like
''
,
Miss
Ada
had
said
.
``
No
.
All
I
want
is
a
picture
--
with
a
few
lines
.
Make
the
man
put
them
in
if
he
has
to
''
.
After
that
they
had
sat
for
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
.
Then
Miss
Ada
had
stood
up
,
rustling
and
rustling
,
and
gone
upstairs
.
Was
it
love
?
?
I
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
.
During
the
rest
of
the
summer
my
scholarly
mania
for
making
plaster
casts
and
spatter
prints
of
Catskill
flowers
and
leaves
was
all
but
surpassed
by
the
constantly
renewed
impressions
of
Jessica
that
my
mind
served
up
to
me
for
contemplation
and
delight
.
Nothing
in
all
the
preceding
years
had
had
the
power
to
bring
me
closer
to
a
knowledge
of
profound
sorrow
than
the
breakup
of
camp
,
the
packing
away
of
my
camp
uniforms
,
the
severing
of
ties
with
the
six
or
ten
people
I
had
grown
most
to
love
in
the
world
.
In
final
separation
from
them
,
in
the
railroad
terminal
across
the
river
from
New
York
,
I
would
nearly
cry
.
My
parents'
welcoming
arms
would
seem
woeful
,
inadequate
,
unwanted
.
But
that
year
was
different
,
for
just
as
the
city
,
in
the
form
of
my
street
clothes
,
had
intruded
upon
my
mountain
nights
,
so
an
essential
part
of
the
summer
gave
promise
of
continuing
into
the
fall
:
Jessica
and
I
,
about
to
be
separated
not
by
a
mere
footbridge
or
messhall
kitchen
but
by
the
immense
obstacle
of
residing
in
cruelly
distant
boroughs
,
had
agreed
to
correspond
.
These
letters
became
the
center
of
my
existence
.
I
lived
to
see
an
envelope
of
hers
in
the
morning
mail
and
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
in
the
afternoon
to
reread
her
letter
for
the
tenth
time
and
finally
prepare
an
answer
.
My
memory
has
catalogued
for
easy
reference
and
withdrawal
the
image
of
her
pink
,
scented
stationery
and
the
unsloped
,
almost
printed
configurations
of
her
neat
,
studious
handwriting
with
which
she
invited
me
to
recall
our
summer
,
so
many
sentences
beginning
with
``
Remember
when
;
;
''
and
others
concerning
camp
friends
who
resided
in
her
suburban
neighborhood
,
,
and
news
of
her
commencing
again
her
piano
lessons
,
her
private
school
,
a
visit
to
Boston
to
see
her
grandparents
and
an
uncle
who
was
a
surgeon
returned
on
furlough
,
wounded
,
from
the
war
in
Europe
.
In
my
letters
I
took
on
a
personality
that
differed
from
the
self
I
knew
in
real
life
.
Then
epistolatory
me
was
a
foreign
correspondent
dispatching
exciting
cables
and
communiques
,
full
of
dash
and
wit
and
glamor
,
quoting
from
the
books
I
read
,
imitating
the
grand
styles
of
the
authors
recommended
by
a
teacher
in
whose
special
,
after-school
class
I
was
enrolled
.
The
letters
took
their
source
from
a
stream
of
my
imagination
in
which
I
was
transformed
into
a
young
man
not
unlike
my
bunkmate
Eliot
Sands
--
he
of
the
porch
steps
anecdotes
--
who
smoked
cigarettes
,
performed
the
tango
,
wore
fifty
dollar
suits
,
and
sneaked
off
into
the
dark
with
girls
to
do
unimaginable
things
with
them
.
Like
Eliot
,
in
my
fantasies
,
I
had
a
proud
bearing
and
,
with
a
skill
that
was
vaguely
continental
,
I
would
lead
Jessica
through
an
evening
of
dancing
and
handsome
descriptions
of
my
newest
exploits
,
would
guide
her
gently
to
the
night's
climax
which
,
in
my
dreams
,
was
always
represented
by
our
almost
suffocating
one
another
to
death
with
deep
,
moist
kisses
burning
with
love
.
The
night
after
reading
her
letter
about
her
surgeon
uncle
--
it
must
have
been
late
in
September
--
I
had
a
vision
of
myself
returned
in
ragged
uniform
from
The
Front
,
nearly
dying
,
my
head
bandaged
and
blooded
,
and
Jessica
bending
over
me
,
the
power
of
her
love
bringing
me
back
to
life
.
For
many
nights
afterward
,
the
idea
of
her
having
been
so
close
to
me
in
that
imagined
bed
would
return
and
fill
me
with
obscure
and
painful
desires
,
would
cause
me
to
lie
awake
in
shame
,
tossing
with
irresolution
,
longing
to
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
.
The
weeks
went
by
,
and
the
longer
our
separation
grew
,
the
more
unbounded
and
almost
unbearable
my
fantasies
became
.
They
caused
my
love
for
Jessica
to
become
warmer
and
at
the
same
time
more
hopeless
,
as
if
my
adolescent
self
knew
that
only
torment
would
ever
bring
me
the
courage
to
ask
to
see
her
again
.
As
it
turned
out
,
Jessica
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
.
Having
received
permission
to
give
a
camp
reunion-Halloween
party
,
she
asked
that
I
come
and
be
her
date
.
I
went
and
,
mum
and
nervous
,
all
but
made
a
fool
of
myself
.
Again
among
those
jubilantly
reunited
bunkmates
,
I
was
shy
with
Jessie
and
acted
as
I
had
during
those
early
Saturday
mornings
when
we
all
seemed
to
be
playing
for
effect
,
to
be
detached
and
unconcerned
with
the
girls
who
were
properly
our
dates
but
about
whom
,
later
,
in
the
privacy
of
our
bunks
,
we
would
think
in
terms
of
the
most
elaborate
romance
.
I
remember
standing
in
a
corner
,
watching
Jessica
act
the
hostess
,
serving
soft
drinks
to
her
guests
.
She
was
wearing
her
dark
hair
in
two
,
thick
braids
to
attain
an
``
American
Girl
''
effect
she
thought
was
appropriate
to
Halloween
.
It
made
her
look
sweet
and
schoolgirlish
,
I
was
excited
to
be
with
her
,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
express
it
.
Yet
a
moment
did
come
that
night
when
the
adventurous
letter
writer
and
fantasist
seemed
to
stride
off
my
flashy
pages
,
out
of
my
mind
,
and
plant
himself
in
reality
.
It
was
late
,
we
were
playing
kissing
games
,
and
Jessica
and
I
were
called
on
to
kiss
in
front
of
the
others
.
We
blushed
and
were
flustered
,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
fleetest
brush
of
lips
upon
cheek
.
The
kiss
outraged
our
friends
but
it
was
done
and
meanwhile
had
released
in
me
all
the
remote
,
exciting
premonitions
of
lust
,
all
the
mysterious
sensations
that
I
had
imagined
a
truly
consummated
kiss
would
convey
to
me
.
It
was
at
that
party
that
,
finally
overcoming
my
timidity
,
inspired
by
tales
only
half-understood
and
overheard
among
older
boys
,
I
asked
Jessie
to
spend
New
Year's
Eve
with
me
.
Lovingly
,
she
accepted
,
and
so
great
was
my
emotion
that
all
I
could
think
of
saying
was
,
``
You're
amazing
,
you
know
''
?
?
Later
,
we
agreed
to
think
of
how
we
wished
to
spend
that
night
.
We
would
write
to
one
another
and
make
a
definite
plan
.
She
was
terribly
pleased
.
Among
my
school
and
neighborhood
friends
,
during
the
next
months
,
I
bragged
and
swaggered
and
pompously
described
my
impending
date
.
But
though
I
boasted
and
gave
off
a
dapper
front
,
I
was
beneath
it
all
frightened
.
It
would
be
the
first
time
I
had
ever
been
completely
alone
with
a
girl
I
loved
.
I
had
no
idea
of
what
subjects
one
discussed
when
alone
with
a
girl
,
or
how
one
behaved
:
Should
I
hold
her
hand
while
walking
or
only
when
crossing
the
street
?
?
Should
I
bring
along
a
corsage
or
send
one
to
her
?
?
Was
it
preferable
to
meet
her
at
home
or
in
the
city
?
?
Should
I
accompany
her
to
the
door
of
her
home
,
or
should
I
ask
to
be
invited
in
?
?
In
or
out
,
should
I
kiss
her
goodnight
?
?
All
this
was
unknown
to
me
,
and
yet
I
had
dared
to
ask
her
out
for
the
most
important
night
of
the
year
!
!
When
in
one
letter
Jessica
informed
me
that
her
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
her
going
out
alone
on
New
Year's
Eve
,
I
knew
for
a
moment
an
immense
relief
;
;
but
the
letter
went
on
:
she
had
cried
,
she
had
implored
,
she
had
been
miserable
at
his
refusal
,
and
finally
he
had
relented
--
and
now
how
happy
she
was
,
how
expectant
!
!
Her
optimism
gave
me
heart
.
I
forced
confidence
into
myself
.
I
made
inquiries
,
I
read
a
book
of
etiquette
.
In
December
I
wrote
her
with
authority
that
we
would
meet
on
the
steps
of
the
Hotel
Astor
,
a
rendezvous
spot
that
I
had
learned
was
the
most
sophisticated
.
We
would
attend
a
film
and
,
later
on
,
I
stated
,
we
might
go
to
the
Mayflower
Coffee
Shop
or
Child's
or
Toffenetti's
for
waffles
.
I
set
the
hour
of
our
meeting
for
seven
.
At
five
o'clock
that
night
it
was
already
dark
,
and
behind
my
closed
door
I
was
dressing
as
carefully
as
a
groom
.
I
wore
a
new
double-breasted
brown
worsted
suit
with
a
faint
herringbone
design
and
wide
lapels
like
a
devil's
ears
.
My
camp-made
leather
wallet
,
bulky
with
twisted
,
raised
stitches
around
the
edges
,
I
stuffed
with
money
I
had
been
saving
.
Hatless
,
in
an
overcoat
of
rough
blue
wool
,
I
was
given
a
proud
farewell
by
my
mother
and
father
,
and
I
set
out
into
the
strangely
still
streets
of
Brooklyn
.
I
felt
superior
to
the
neighborhood
friends
I
was
leaving
behind
,
felt
older
than
my
years
,
and
was
full
of
compliments
for
myself
as
I
headed
into
the
subway
that
was
carrying
its
packs
of
passengers
out
of
that
dull
borough
and
into
the
unstable
,
tantalizing
excitement
of
Manhattan
.
Times
Square
,
when
I
ascended
to
it
with
my
fellow
subway
travellers
(
all
dressed
as
if
for
a
huge
wedding
in
a
family
of
which
we
were
all
distant
members
)
,
was
nearly
impassable
,
the
sidewalks
swarming
with
celebrants
,
with
bundled
up
sailors
and
soldiers
already
hugging
their
girls
and
their
rationed
bottles
of
whiskey
.
Heavy-coated
,
severe-looking
policemen
sat
astride
noble
horses
along
the
curbside
to
prevent
the
revellers
from
spilling
out
in
front
of
the
crawling
traffic
.
The
night
was
cold
but
the
crowd
kept
one
warm
.
The
giant
electric
signs
and
marquees
were
lit
up
for
the
first
time
since
blackout
regulations
had
been
instituted
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
alive
with
the
feeling
that
victory
was
just
around
the
corner
.
Cardboard
noisemakers
,
substitutes
for
the
unavailable
tin
models
,
were
being
hawked
and
bought
at
makeshift
stands
every
few
yards
along
Broadway
,
and
one's
ears
were
continually
serenaded
by
the
horns'
rasps
and
bleats
.
An
old
gentlemen
next
to
me
held
a
Boy
Scout
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blasted
away
at
every
fourth
step
and
during
the
interim
shouted
out
,
``
V
for
Victory
''
!
!
His
neighbors
cheered
him
on
.
There
was
a
great
sense
of
camaraderie
.
How
did
one
join
them
?
?
Where
were
they
all
walking
to
?
?
Was
I
supposed
to
buy
a
funny
hat
and
a
rattle
for
Jessica
?
?
It
was
a
quarter
of
seven
when
the
crowd
washed
me
up
among
the
other
gallants
who
had
established
the
Astor
steps
as
the
beach-head
from
which
to
launch
their
night
of
merrymaking
.
I
looked
over
their
faces
and
felt
a
twinge
:
they
all
looked
so
much
more
knowing
than
I
.
I
looked
away
.
I
looked
for
Jessica
to
materialize
out
of
the
clogging
,
curdling
crowd
and
,
as
the
time
passed
and
I
waited
,
a
fiend
came
to
life
beside
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
:
How
was
I
planning
to
greet
Jessica
?
?
Where
exactly
would
we
go
after
the
movie
?
?
Suppose
the
lines
in
front
of
the
movie
houses
were
too
long
and
we
couldn't
get
in
?
?
Suppose
I
hadn't
brought
along
enough
money
?
?
I
felt
for
my
wallet
.
Its
thick
,
substantial
outline
calmed
me
.
But
when
I
saw
that
it
was
already
ten
past
seven
,
I
began
to
wonder
if
something
had
gone
wrong
.
Suppose
her
father
had
changed
his
mind
and
had
refused
to
let
her
leave
?
?
Suppose
at
this
very
moment
her
father
was
calling
my
house
in
an
effort
to
cancel
the
plans
?
?
I
grew
uneasy
.
All
about
me
there
was
a
hectic
interplay
of
meetings
taking
place
,
like
abrupt
,
jerky
scenes
in
old
silent
movies
,
joyous
greetings
and
beginnings
,
huggings
and
kissings
,
enthusiastic
forays
into
the
festive
night
.
Whole
platoons
were
taking
up
new
positions
on
the
steps
,
arriving
and
departing
,
while
I
stayed
glued
,
like
a
signpost
,
to
one
spot
.
At
7:25
two
hotel
doormen
came
thumping
down
the
steps
,
carrying
a
saw-horse
to
be
set
up
as
a
barricade
in
front
of
the
haberdashery
store
window
next
to
the
entranceway
,
and
as
I
watched
them
in
their
gaudy
red
coats
that
nearly
scraped
the
ground
,
their
golden
,
fringed
epaulets
and
spic
,
red-visored
caps
,
I
suddenly
saw
just
over
their
shoulders
Jessica
gracefully
making
her
way
through
the
crowd
.
My
heart
almost
stopped
beating
.
There
were
thirty-eight
patients
on
the
bus
the
morning
I
left
for
Hanover
,
most
of
them
disturbed
and
hallucinating
.
An
interne
,
a
nurse
and
two
attendants
were
in
charge
of
us
.
I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
stared
out
the
bus
window
at
Chicago's
grim
,
dirty
West
Side
.
It
seemed
incredible
,
as
I
listened
to
the
monotonous
drone
of
voices
and
smelled
the
fetid
odors
coming
from
the
patients
,
that
technically
I
was
a
ward
of
the
state
of
Illinois
,
going
to
a
hospital
for
the
mentally
ill
.
I
suddenly
thought
of
Mary
Jane
Brennan
,
the
way
her
pretty
eyes
could
flash
with
anger
,
her
quiet
competence
,
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
lay
just
beneath
the
surface
of
her
defenses
.
We
had
become
good
friends
during
my
stay
at
Cook
County
Hospital
.
I
had
told
her
enough
about
myself
to
offset
somewhat
the
damaging
stories
that
had
appeared
in
local
newspapers
after
my
little
adventure
in
Marshall
Field
&
Co.
.
She
knew
that
I
lived
at
a
good
address
on
the
Gold
Coast
,
that
I
had
once
been
a
medical
student
and
was
thinking
of
returning
to
the
university
to
finish
my
medical
studies
.
She
knew
also
that
I
was
unmarried
and
without
a
single
known
relative
.
She
wasn't
quite
sure
that
I
felt
enough
remorse
about
my
drinking
,
or
that
I
would
not
return
to
it
once
I
was
out
and
on
my
own
again
.
This
had
worried
her
.
``
I
read
those
newspaper
stories
about
you
''
,
she
had
said
.
``
You
must
have
loved
that
girl
very
much
,
but
you
couldn't
have
meant
it
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
kill
her
''
.
``
Why
do
you
say
that
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
I
was
full
of
booze
and
,
well
,
a
drunk
is
apt
to
do
anything
he
says
he'll
do
''
.
Nonsense
!
!
I
grew
up
in
an
Irish
neighborhood
on
Chicago's
West
Side
.
Don't
tell
me
about
drunks
.
You're
not
the
kind
to
go
violent
.
Were
you
in
love
with
that
girl
''
?
?
``
Would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
I
were
,
Mary
Jane
''
?
?
She
met
my
eyes
,
suddenly
angry
.
``
I
wouldn't
have
gone
into
nursing
if
I
didn't
care
about
people
.
I'm
interested
in
every
patient
I've
helped
take
care
of
.
When
I
think
of
people
like
you
,
well
,
I
''
--
``
You
what
,
Mary
Jane
''
?
?
``
You
are
young
,
intelligent
,
have
a
whole
lifetime
before
you
to
make
something
worth
while
of
yourself
,
but
you
mess
it
up
with
whiskey
,
indifference
,
self-destructive
attitudes
.
I
don't
blame
that
girl
for
breaking
her
engagement
with
you
.
Was
she
pretty
''
?
?
``
Oh
,
yes
''
,
I
said
,
feeling
annoyed
,
``
she
was
very
pretty
.
You
don't
believe
that
I'm
going
back
to
medical
school
and
finish
,
do
you
''
?
?
``
Why
should
I
?
?
I've
worked
this
ward
for
three
months
now
.
We
keep
getting
the
same
ones
back
again
and
again
.
They
all
mean
well
,
have
great
promises
to
make
when
they
are
about
to
go
home
,
but
drinking
is
their
sickness
.
You've
not
seemed
like
them
,
but
maybe
you
are
.
You've
treated
your
stay
here
like
a
big
joke
.
It's
not
a
joke
to
be
sent
to
a
place
like
this
or
to
Hanover
.
I
wanted
to
go
to
college
,
too
''
--
``
Why
didn't
you
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
Chicago
has
some
of
the
best
''
--
Her
eyes
flashed
angrily
.
``
That's
what
I
mean
about
you
,
Anderson
''
,
she
said
.
``
You
don't
seem
to
know
much
about
reality
.
I'll
tell
you
why
I
didn't
go
to
college
;
;
I'm
the
oldest
of
six
children
.
My
father's
a
policeman
and
makes
less
than
seven
thousand
dollars
a
year
.
There
was
no
money
for
tuition
,
for
clothes
,
for
all
the
things
you
apparently
take
for
granted
.
Nurses'
training
here
doesn't
cost
anything
.
They
even
pay
me
six
dollars
a
month
.
I
think
it's
a
good
deal
.
I'm
going
to
become
a
good
nurse
,
and
I've
got
two
baby
brothers
that
are
going
to
have
college
if
I
have
to
work
at
my
profession
until
I'm
an
old
maid
to
give
it
to
them
''
.
``
Do
you
have
a
boy
friend
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
That's
none
of
your
business
''
,
she
said
,
then
changed
the
subject
.
``
What
about
your
father
and
mother
,
don't
you
think
of
them
when
you're
in
a
place
like
this
''
?
?
``
My
father
and
mother
died
when
I
was
two
years
old
''
,
I
said
.
``
My
aunt
raised
me
.
Aunt
Mary
died
when
I
was
doing
my
military
service
.
I
have
no
one
but
myself
to
worry
about
''
.
Something
in
my
voice
must
have
touched
her
deeply
because
her
anger
passed
quickly
,
and
she
turned
away
to
keep
me
from
seeing
her
face
.
``
I'm
sorry
''
,
she
said
.
``
I
don't
know
what
I'd
do
without
my
family
.
We've
always
been
so
close
''
.
``
Tell
me
more
about
them
''
.
Her
eyes
became
bright
as
she
talked
about
her
father
and
mother
,
aunts
and
uncles
,
cousins
.
Listening
,
I
felt
cheated
and
lonely
as
only
an
orphan
can
.
When
she
had
finished
I
said
:
``
Your
dad
sounds
like
a
good
father
and
a
good
policeman
.
I'll
bet
he
wouldn't
be
pleased
if
a
rumdum
like
me
were
to
ask
his
daughter
for
a
date
--
I
mean
,
after
I'm
out
of
the
hospital
,
a
month
or
so
from
now
''
.
``
My
father
is
a
sergeant
of
detectives
and
has
been
attached
to
Homicide
for
five
years
.
He's
a
pretty
good
judge
of
character
,
Anderson
.
I
don't
think
he'd
mind
too
much
if
he
were
sure
you'd
decided
not
to
be
a
rumdum
in
the
future
''
.
``
What
about
you
?
?
How
would
you
feel
about
it
if
I
were
to
ask
you
for
a
date
when
I
get
through
at
Hanover
''
?
?
``
If
I
thought
you
were
serious
about
going
back
to
school
,
that
you'd
learned
something
from
your
experiences
here
and
at
Hanover
--
well
,
I
might
consider
such
an
offer
.
What
about
your
that
girl
you
were
going
to
kill
''
?
?
It
suddenly
seemed
very
important
to
me
that
Mary
Jane
Brennan
should
know
the
truth
about
me
--
that
I
was
not
the
confused
,
sick
,
irresponsible
person
she
believed
me
to
be
.
``
There
are
things
about
me
that
I
can't
tell
you
now
,
Mary
Jane
''
,
I
said
,
``
but
if
you'll
go
out
to
dinner
with
me
when
I
get
out
of
Hanover
,
I'd
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
.
I
can
say
this
:
I'm
dead
serious
about
going
back
to
school
.
As
for
that
other
girl
,
let's
just
say
that
I
never
want
to
see
her
again
.
You
will
get
to
come
home
on
long
weekends
from
Hanover
,
won't
you
''
?
?
``
Yes
,
I'll
get
one
overnight
a
month
''
.
``
We'll
go
up
to
the
Edgewater
Beach
Hotel
for
dinner
''
,
I
said
.
``
Do
you
like
to
dance
?
?
They
always
have
a
good
orchestra
''
.
``
I
like
to
dance
''
,
she
said
,
then
turned
and
walked
away
.
There
hadn't
been
anything
really
personal
in
her
interest
in
me
.
I
knew
that
.
It
was
just
that
she
felt
deeply
about
every
patient
on
the
ward
and
wanted
to
believe
that
they
might
benefit
from
their
treatment
there
.
Now
,
riding
this
hospital
bus
,
feeling
isolated
and
utterly
alone
,
I
knew
that
she
was
genuine
and
unique
,
quite
unlike
any
girl
I
had
known
before
.
It
seemed
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
at
this
moment
that
she
should
know
the
real
truth
about
me
.
It
was
a
fantastic
story
.
Only
two
people
in
the
state
of
Illinois
knew
that
I
was
entering
Hanover
State
Hospital
under
an
assumed
name
,
or
why
.
It
was
unlikely
that
any
girl
as
sharp
as
Mary
Jane
Brennan
would
believe
it
without
proof
.
But
I
had
the
proof
,
all
documented
in
a
legal
agreement
which
I
would
show
her
the
moment
I
was
free
to
do
so
.
As
the
bus
turned
into
the
main
highway
and
headed
toward
Hanover
I
settled
back
in
my
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
,
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
,
trying
to
put
the
pieces
in
order
.
I
wondered
suddenly
as
I
listened
to
the
disconnected
jabberings
coming
from
the
patient
behind
me
,
if
I
had
not
perhaps
imagined
it
all
.
Perhaps
this
was
reality
and
Dale
Nelson
,
the
actor
,
was
delusion
;
;
a
figment
of
Carl
Anderson's
imagination
.
Four
I
had
come
to
Chicago
from
New
York
early
in
September
with
a
dramatic
production
called
Ask
Tony
.
It
was
a
bad
play
,
real
grade-A
turkey
,
which
only
a
prevalence
of
angels
with
grandiose
dreams
of
capital
gain
and
tax
money
to
burn
could
have
put
into
rehearsal
.
No
one
,
not
even
the
producer
,
had
any
real
hope
of
getting
it
back
to
Broadway
.
But
because
it
was
a
suspense
gangster
story
of
the
Capone
era
,
many
of
us
felt
that
it
might
catch
on
for
a
run
in
Chicago
,
continue
as
a
road
company
,
and
eventually
become
a
movie
.
Such
optimism
was
completely
unjustified
.
The
critics
literally
screamed
their
indignation
.
Ask
Tony
was
doomed
from
the
moment
Kupcinet
leveled
on
it
in
his
Sun-Times
column
.
We
opened
on
Friday
and
closed
the
following
Monday
.
Out
of
the
entire
cast
I
alone
received
good
notices
for
my
portrayal
of
a
psychopathic
killer
.
This
let
me
in
for
a
lot
of
kidding
from
the
rest
of
the
company
,
two
members
of
which
were
native
Chicagoans
.
We
were
paid
off
Tuesday
morning
and
given
tickets
back
to
New
York
.
I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
packed
my
bags
at
the
Croydon
Hotel
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
was
destined
to
be
one
brilliant
failure
after
another
.
I
had
been
among
the
top
third
in
my
class
at
N.Y.U.
,
had
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
medical
school
,
but
I'd
run
out
of
money
and
energy
at
the
same
time
.
Then
later
I
had
quit
my
safe
,
secure
five-a-week
spot
on
a
network
soap
opera
to
take
a
part
in
this
play
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
not
only
unlucky
but
quite
stupid
as
well
.
I
knew
that
I'd
soon
be
back
working
as
an
orderly
at
the
hospital
or
as
a
counterman
at
Union
News
or
Schraffts
while
waiting
for
another
acting
job
to
open
.
It
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
I
did
not
particularly
like
acting
,
that
I
was
at
some
sort
of
crossroads
and
would
have
to
decide
soon
what
I
was
going
to
do
with
my
life
.
I
closed
the
last
bag
and
stood
all
three
at
the
door
for
the
bellboy
to
pick
up
,
then
went
to
the
bathroom
for
a
drink
of
water
.
The
telephone
rang
.
When
I
answered
it
a
voice
too
dignified
and
British
to
be
real
said
,
``
Is
this
Mr.
Dale
Nelson
,
the
actor
''
?
?
``
All
right
''
,
I
said
.
``
Why
don't
you
bastards
lay
off
for
a
while
''
?
?
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
''
?
?
``
All
right
.
This
is
Dale
Nelson
the
actor
''
.
``
Good
.
I'm
calling
you
,
Mr.
Nelson
,
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Phillip
Wycoff
.
Could
you
possibly
have
lunch
with
him
today
?
?
His
car
could
pick
you
up
at
your
hotel
at
twelve
''
.
I
smiled
.
``
You'll
send
the
Rolls-Royce
,
of
course
''
?
?
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Nelson
''
.
I
started
to
say
something
else
appropriate
,
but
the
man
had
hung
up
.
I
finally
went
downstairs
to
the
bar
off
the
main
lobby
where
most
of
the
cast
were
drowning
their
sorrows
over
the
untimely
passing
of
Ask
Tony
.
They
all
bowed
low
as
I
approached
them
.
``
All
right
,
you
bastards
''
,
I
said
,
``
the
great
actor
is
about
to
buy
a
drink
''
.
I
laid
a
tenspot
on
the
bar
and
motioned
to
the
bartender
to
serve
a
round
.
He
had
just
returned
my
change
when
the
doorman
came
in
off
the
street
to
page
me
.
I
walked
over
to
him
.
``
You
Mr.
Nelson
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
That's
right
''
.
``
Mr.
Wycoff's
car
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
east
entrance
''
.
I
followed
him
out
through
the
lobby
to
the
street
.
An
ancient
Rolls-Royce
,
as
shiningly
impressive
as
the
day
it
came
off
the
ship
,
was
parked
at
the
curb
.
The
elderly
chauffeur
,
immaculate
in
a
dark
uniform
,
stood
stiffly
at
attention
holding
open
the
door
of
the
town
car
.
I
was
giving
the
parked
cars
the
once-over
.
The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license
number
JYJ
114
was
in
stall
number
five
.
``
Okay
''
,
I
said
to
the
attendant
,
``
I'll
let
you
know
if
I
close
the
deal
on
the
office
in
this
building
''
.
I
walked
with
him
back
to
the
entrance
.
He
gave
me
a
ticket
on
the
agency
car
and
parked
it
.
I
was
back
in
ten
minutes
.
``
Forgot
to
get
something
out
of
the
car
''
,
I
told
him
,
showing
him
my
ticket
.
He
started
to
say
something
as
I
walked
in
and
then
suddenly
grinned
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
yes
.
You're
the
one
I
was
talking
to
about
a
monthly
rental
.
``
That's
right
''
,
I
told
him
.
He
consulted
the
parking
ticket
,
then
looked
at
a
notation
and
said
,
``
You're
in
the
third
row
back
toward
the
rear
.
Can
you
find
it
all
right
''
?
?
``
Sure
''
,
I
told
him
.
I
went
back
to
the
agency
car
and
got
out
an
electric
bug
,
one
of
the
newest
devices
for
electronic
shadowing
.
I
always
keep
a
set
in
the
car
.
I
put
in
new
batteries
so
as
to
be
certain
I'd
have
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way
out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
.
I
waited
until
the
parking
attendant
was
busy
with
a
customer
,
then
slipped
around
the
back
of
the
car
with
license
number
JYM
114
,
attached
the
electronic
bug
to
the
rear
bumper
and
walked
out
.
The
attendant
waved
me
on
.
One
of
the
hardest
chores
a
detective
has
is
hanging
around
on
a
city
street
,
trying
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
entrance
of
an
office
building
and
waiting
.
For
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
it's
possible
to
be
more
or
less
interested
in
window
displays
,
then
in
people
passing
by
.
After
a
while
,
however
,
a
person's
mind
gets
fed
up
and
that
magnifies
all
of
the
disagreeable
physical
symptoms
which
go
with
that
sort
of
an
assignment
.
You
want
to
sit
down
.
Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
.
You're
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
,
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
.
I
waited
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came
out
of
the
office
building
.
He
came
out
alone
.
I
wasn't
far
behind
him
when
he
entered
the
parking
lot
and
hurried
over
to
his
car
.
The
attendant
recognized
me
once
more
and
said
,
``
What
did
you
do
about
that
office
''
?
?
``
I
haven't
made
up
my
mind
yet
''
,
I
said
.
``
It's
a
sublease
.
I
have
a
couple
of
them
I'm
figuring
on
;
;
one
here
and
one
that's
out
quite
a
ways
where
there's
usually
curb
parking
''
.
``
That
curb
parking
is
undependable
and
annoying
,
particularly
when
it
rains
''
,
he
said
.
I
kept
trying
to
get
him
to
take
my
money
.
``
Okay
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
I'm
in
a
rush
right
now
.
I
know
where
the
car
is
.
Want
me
to
drive
it
out
''
?
?
``
I'll
have
one
of
the
boys
get
it
''
,
he
said
.
``
It's
one
of
the
rules
on
transients
.
Regulars
drive
out
their
own
cars
''
.
``
Make
it
as
snappy
as
you
can
,
will
you
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
Oh
,
that's
all
right
''
,
he
said
.
``
You're
going
to
be
a
regular
.
You'll
get
in
the
office
building
here
.
You
don't
want
to
lease
a
place
way
out
in
the
sticks
.
You
get
business
where
the
business
is
,
not
where
it
isn't
''
.
I
grinned
at
him
,
handed
him
a
couple
of
dollars
and
said
,
``
By
the
time
you
get
the
parking
charge
figured
up
,
there
should
be
a
cigar
in
it
for
you
''
.
I
hurried
over
to
the
agency
heap
,
jumped
in
,
started
the
motor
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
car
I
wanted
to
shadow
turn
to
the
left
.
I
was
held
up
a
bit
trying
to
make
a
left
turn
.
By
the
time
I'd
made
it
he
was
gone
.
Traffic
was
pretty
heavy
.
I
turned
on
the
electric
bug
,
and
the
signal
came
in
loud
and
clear
.
I
made
time
and
picked
him
up
within
ten
blocks
.
I
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
,
letting
lots
of
cars
keep
in
between
us
,
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.
After
fifteen
minutes
of
traffic
driving
he
turned
to
the
left
.
I
couldn't
see
him
,
but
the
electric
bugging
device
gave
steady
beeps
when
it
was
straight
ahead
,
short
half
beeps
when
the
car
I
was
following
was
to
the
left
,
and
long
drawn-out
beeps
when
it
turned
to
the
right
.
If
it
ever
got
behind
me
,
the
beep
turned
to
a
buzz
.
I
turned
left
too
soon
and
got
a
signal
showing
that
I
was
still
behind
him
but
he
was
to
the
right
.
After
a
while
the
signal
became
a
buzz
and
I
knew
he
was
behind
me
.
That
meant
he'd
parked
someplace
.
I
made
a
big
circle
until
I
located
the
car
parked
at
the
curb
in
front
of
an
apartment
house
.
I
found
a
parking
place
half
a
block
away
,
sat
in
the
car
and
waited
.
My
quarry
was
in
the
apartment
house
for
two
hours
.
Then
he
came
out
and
started
driving
toward
the
beach
.
By
this
time
it
was
dark
.
I
could
get
up
close
to
him
where
there
was
traffic
but
had
to
drop
far
behind
when
there
wasn't
traffic
.
My
lights
would
have
been
a
giveaway
if
I'd
tried
to
shadow
him
in
the
conventional
manner
.
Moreover
,
I'd
have
lost
him
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
.
His
signal
was
coming
loud
and
clear
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
turned
to
a
buzz
.
I
circled
the
block
and
found
he
was
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
high-class
restaurant
.
I
sat
where
I
could
watch
the
exit
and
realized
I
was
hungry
.
I
sat
there
with
the
faint
odor
of
charcoal-broiled
steaks
tantalizing
my
nostrils
and
occasionally
catching
the
aroma
of
coffee
.
My
man
came
out
an
hour
later
,
drove
to
the
beach
,
turned
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went
to
the
Swim
and
Tan
Motel
.
It
was
a
fairly
modern
motel
with
quite
a
bit
of
electrical
display
in
front
.
I
remembered
it
was
the
Peeping
Tom
place
.
I
waited
until
my
man
was
coming
out
of
the
office
with
the
key
to
a
cabin
before
I
went
in
to
register
.
The
card
the
man
I
was
shadowing
had
filled
out
was
still
on
the
counter
.
I
noticed
that
he
was
in
Unit
12
and
that
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
Oscar
L.
Palmer
and
wife
,
giving
a
San
Francisco
address
.
He
had
written
out
the
license
number
of
his
car
but
had
transposed
the
last
two
figures
,
an
old
dodge
which
is
still
good
.
Ninety-nine
times
out
of
a
hundred
the
motel
manager
doesn't
check
the
license
number
on
the
plates
against
the
license
number
the
tenant
writes
out
.
If
he
does
,
it's
still
better
than
an
even
chance
he
won't
notice
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
,
and
if
he
should
notice
it
,
the
thing
can
be
passed
off
as
an
honest
mistake
.
I
used
the
alias
of
Robert
C.
Richards
,
gave
the
first
three
letters
and
the
first
and
last
figure
of
the
license
number
on
the
agency
heap
,
but
a
couple
of
phony
numbers
in
between
.
I
could
have
written
anything
.
The
manager
of
the
motel
was
a
woman
who
apparently
didn't
care
.
She
was
complying
with
the
law
in
regard
to
registrations
but
she
certainly
wasn't
checking
license
numbers
or
bothering
the
tenants
.
``
You
mean
you're
all
alone
,
Mr.
Richards
''
?
?
``
That's
right
''
.
``
Your
wife
isn't
going
to
join
you
--
later
''
?
?
``
I
don't
think
so
''
.
``
If
you
expect
her
to
show
up
''
,
she
said
,
``
you'd
better
put
'
and
wife
'
on
there
.
It's
a
formality
,
you
know
''
.
``
Any
difference
in
the
rate
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
Not
to
you
''
,
she
said
smiling
.
``
It's
ten
dollars
either
way
.
There
are
ice
cubes
in
a
container
at
the
far
end
and
in
another
by
the
office
.
There
are
three
soft-drink
vending
machines
,
and
if
you
should
be
joined
by
--
anybody
--
try
to
keep
things
quiet
,
if
you
will
.
We
like
to
run
a
nice
quiet
place
''
.
``
Thank
you
''
,
I
told
her
.
I
took
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
,
then
took
the
key
to
Unit
13
that
she
had
given
me
and
went
down
long
enough
to
park
the
car
.
The
construction
was
reasonably
solid
;
;
not
like
the
cracker-box
construction
of
so
many
of
the
motel
units
that
have
stucco
all
over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
.
I
put
a
small
electric
amplifier
against
the
wall
on
the
side
I
wanted
to
case
.
With
the
aid
of
that
I
could
hear
my
man
moving
around
,
heard
him
cough
a
couple
of
times
,
heard
the
toilet
flush
,
heard
the
sound
of
water
running
.
Whoever
his
companion
was
going
to
be
,
she
was
going
to
join
him
later
.
She
knew
where
to
come
.
He
didn't
have
to
telephone
.
I
was
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt
all
lines
of
communication
had
been
severed
.
It's
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
you're
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
you're
simply
postponing
a
meal
,
but
when
you're
dependent
on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
can't
eat
until
he's
bedded
down
for
the
night
,
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
.
I
had
noticed
a
drive-in
down
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
The
batteries
on
the
bugging
device
I
had
put
on
the
car
were
still
fresh
enough
to
send
out
good
strong
signals
.
The
powerful
microphone
I
could
press
against
the
wall
between
my
motel
unit
and
that
occupied
by
the
man
would
bring
in
the
sound
of
any
conversation
,
and
I
was
positively
nauseated
I
was
so
hungry
.
I
got
in
the
car
,
drove
down
to
the
drive-in
and
ordered
a
couple
of
hamburgers
with
everything
included
,
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
.
The
place
wasn't
particularly
busy
at
that
time
of
night
,
and
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
me
,
who
was
clothed
in
the
tightest-fitting
pair
of
slacks
I
had
ever
seen
on
a
woman
and
a
sweater
that
showed
everything
there
was
--
and
there
was
lots
of
it
--
wanted
to
be
sociable
.
``
You
really
in
a
hurry
,
Handsome
''
?
?
She
asked
.
``
I'm
in
a
hurry
,
Beautiful
''
.
``
It's
early
in
the
evening
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
There's
lots
of
time
left
''
.
``
There
may
not
be
any
women
left
''
,
I
said
.
She
gave
a
little
pout
and
said
,
``
I
don't
get
off
work
until
eleven
o'clock
.
That's
when
my
evening
commences
''
.
``
I'll
be
here
at
ten-fifty-five
''
,
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
you
!
!
''
She
announced
.
``
That's
what
they
all
say
.
What's
that
thing
going
buzz-buzz-buzz
in
your
car
''
?
?
I
said
``
Darn
it
,
that's
the
automatic
signal
that
shows
when
the
ignition
key
is
on
.
I
didn't
turn
it
off
''
.
I
reached
over
and
switched
off
the
electronic
bugging
device
.
She
went
in
to
get
the
hamburgers
,
and
I
switched
on
the
device
again
and
kept
the
signal
from
Dowling's
car
coming
in
steady
and
clear
until
I
saw
her
starting
back
with
the
hamburgers
.
Then
I
shut
off
the
device
again
.
She
wanted
to
hang
around
while
I
was
eating
.
``
Don't
you
think
it's
selfish
to
have
dinner
before
you
go
to
pick
her
up
''
?
?
``
No
''
,
I
said
.
``
It's
a
kindness
to
her
.
You
see
,
she's
on
a
diet
.
She'll
eat
just
a
pineapple
and
cottage
cheese
salad
and
I'm
to
have
one
with
her
so
she
won't
feel
out
of
place
''
.
``
Diets
can
be
terrible
''
,
the
girl
said
.
``
How
much
overweight
is
she
''
?
?
``
Not
a
bit
''
,
I
said
,
``
but
she's
keeping
her
figure
in
hand
''
.
She
looked
at
me
provocatively
.
``
Good
figures
should
be
kept
in
hand
''
,
she
said
,
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
.
I
turned
on
the
device
again
,
half
fearful
that
I
might
find
silence
,
but
the
buzzes
came
in
loud
and
clear
.
When
I
switched
on
the
lights
for
her
to
come
and
get
the
check
,
I
had
the
exact
change
plus
a
dollar
tip
.
The
fat
man
said
,
``
All
we
gotta
do
is
go
around
the
corner
''
.
The
gun
moved
.
The
thin
man
said
,
``
That-a-way
''
.
``
--
second
building
on
the
right
''
.
``
--
it
says
police
right
on
the
door
''
.
``
--
so
even
if
we
was
as
dumb
as
you
take
us
for
,
we
could
still
find
it
''
.
Roberta
and
Dave
began
to
back
toward
the
door
.
The
thin
man
waved
the
gun
again
.
He
said
,
``
Right
around
the
corner
''
.
``
It
says
water
works
,
but
there
is
a
policeman
on
duty
,
too
''
.
``
A
night
policeman
just
like
in
the
States
.
You
know
''
?
?
``
Canada
doesn't
have
much
of
this
here
juvenile
delinquency
problem
,
but
we
keep
a
night
policeman
all
the
same
on
account
of
the
crazy
tourists
''
.
At
the
door
,
Dave
paused
to
feel
for
the
latch
.
Roberta
glanced
up
at
her
husband
.
He
was
going
to
be
sensible
and
not
try
to
do
anything
rash
with
that
gun
pointed
at
him
.
She
measured
the
distance
from
where
they
stood
to
the
men
and
the
gun
,
measured
the
distance
from
the
men
to
the
back
room
.
She
decided
to
risk
it
.
There
was
something
phony
about
all
this
gun
waving
--
something
not
quite
what
it
seemed
in
the
detailed
directions
for
finding
the
police
.
Dave
had
the
latch
under
his
thumb
now
and
he
removed
his
arm
from
his
wife
in
order
to
pull
the
door
open
.
In
a
flash
she
was
away
to
the
back
,
paying
no
attention
to
three
angry
shouts
from
the
male
throats
.
She
tore
open
the
back
door
.
It
was
dark
inside
the
room
but
enough
light
spilled
from
the
restaurant
behind
her
to
enable
her
to
make
out
a
round
table
with
a
green
cloth
top
.
There
was
a
small
sideboard
with
some
empty
beer
bottles
on
it
and
perhaps
fifteen
wooden
chairs
.
Slowly
she
turned
to
face
the
men
again
.
Rat-face
at
the
counter
was
on
his
feet
.
The
distance
between
where
she
stood
and
where
Dave
waited
at
the
outside
door
was
a
hundred
miles
.
Keeping
her
frightened
gaze
on
the
men
at
the
counter
,
she
began
to
feel
her
way
to
the
door
.
She
sidled
along
the
booths
one
step
at
a
time
.
The
gun
followed
her
.
As
she
reached
Dave
and
felt
his
arm
go
around
her
,
felt
him
pull
her
to
the
safety
of
his
person
,
she
knew
with
the
certainty
of
despair
that
something
bad
had
happened
to
Lauren
.
The
two
men
watched
as
Dave
closed
the
door
behind
them
,
watched
them
cross
the
sidewalk
to
their
car
.
It
was
getting
light
.
The
fat
man
removed
his
apron
,
put
on
a
greasy
and
wrinkled
jacket
,
and
zipped
it
over
his
paunch
.
The
thin
man
moved
swiftly
to
the
phone
and
dialed
a
number
.
When
he
was
answered
,
he
said
,
``
Albert
?
?
Vince
.
I'm
sending
you
a
couple
of
customers
--
yeah
--
just
get
them
out
of
my
hair
and
keep
them
out
--
I
don't
give
a
damn
what
you
tell
them
--
only
don't
believe
a
word
they
say
--
they're
out
to
make
trouble
for
me
and
it
is
up
to
you
to
stop
them
--
I
don't
care
how
--
and
one
more
thing
--
Cate's
Cafe
closed
at
eleven
like
always
last
night
and
Rose
and
Clarence
Corsi
left
for
Quebec
yesterday
--
some
shrine
or
other
--
I
think
it
was
called
Saint
Simon's
--
yeah
,
yesterday
.
Got
it
''
?
?
He
turned
from
the
phone
and
strode
to
the
front
of
the
restaurant
.
The
white
Buick
hadn't
moved
away
yet
.
Good
.
A
line
of
worry
formed
,
a
twitch
pulled
his
mouth
over
to
one
side
.
He
said
,
``
Grosse
?
?
You
ain't
kidding
me
--
the
kid
don't
know
the
name
of
this
town
''
?
?
``
I
ain't
kidding
you
,
Vince
.
How
could
she
?
?
She
musta
been
walking
in
her
sleep
--
you
seen
her
yourself
in
here
''
.
``
Howda
I
know
''
?
?
``
Remember
how
she
looked
when
Barney
held
the
door
for
her
?
?
Kinda
like
a
zombie
?
?
She
was
just
waking
up
when
we
found
her
at
the
garage
''
.
Vince
swore
.
``
Stupid
fools
--
ain't
got
enough
brains
between
the
two
of
you
''
--
Grosse
muttered
,
his
head
down
,
one
hand
playing
with
the
zipper
on
his
jacket
.
``
--
had
enough
brains
to
call
ya
up
so
as
ya
could
do
sompin
about
it
when
the
parents
--
I
coulda
let
her
go
go
''
--
His
eyes
were
lowered
,
so
he
couldn't
have
seen
the
narrow
,
pointed
face
of
his
companion
suddenly
writhe
with
fury
;
;
but
he
was
aware
of
it
just
the
same
.
He
knew
Vince
Steiner
was
one
of
those
men
who
had
to
work
up
a
fury
once
in
a
while
just
to
prove
how
dangerous
he
could
be
.
With
a
curse
,
Vince
seized
the
thing
nearest
,
a
glass
sugar
container
with
a
spouted
metal
top
,
and
threw
it
against
the
wall
opposite
.
The
heavy
glass
didn't
break
,
but
the
top
flew
off
;
;
sugar
sprayed
with
a
hiss
that
was
loud
in
the
silence
.
Not
really
startled
,
but
careful
to
appear
so
,
Grosse
sucked
noisily
on
his
pipe
.
Vince
cursed
steadily
.
``
Why
does
everything
have
to
happen
to
me
''
?
?
Grosse
quietly
got
a
broom
and
started
to
sweep
up
the
sugar
.
Vince
watched
him
.
His
mouth
worked
over
the
profanity
,
the
obscenities
in
his
vocabulary
.
Once
he
said
,
``
Why'n
hell
didn't
you
look
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
before
you
drove
off
?
?
Don't
you
and
Barney
ever
use
your
brains
''
?
?
The
fat
man
didn't
answer
.
He
got
one
of
the
menus
and
brushed
the
spilled
sugar
onto
it
and
carried
it
to
a
box
on
the
floor
behind
the
counter
.
He
returned
the
menu
to
its
place
between
catchup
bottle
and
paper
napkin
dispenser
.
He
spoke
soothingly
.
``
She
don't
know
nothing
about
them
cars
.
She
thinks
she's
in
a
ordinary
garage
''
.
``
How
do
you
know
,
stupid
?
?
And
put
Cate's
gun
back
''
.
``
I
know
''
.
Grosse
tucked
the
gun
under
the
counter
.
``
--
one
word
of
this
gets
to
Guardino
''
--
``
Who's
telling
Guardino
''
?
?
Vince
swore
again
.
``
You
get
that
kid
over
to
Rose's
house
''
.
The
fat
man
winced
.
He
ran
a
finger
down
his
cheek
,
tracing
the
scratch
there
.
``
Why
can't
I
leave
her
locked
up
in
the
tool
crib
''
?
?
The
thin
man
stopped
his
pacing
long
enough
to
glance
at
the
clock
.
``
You
and
Barney
get
her
over
to
Rose's
before
it
gets
too
light
.
After
Guardino's
left
,
we'll
dump
the
kid
somewhere
near
the
border
where
she
kin
get
home
.
God
help
you
if
she
knows
where
she's
been
''
.
Grosse
spread
his
hands
.
``
What
am
I
going
to
do
with
her
all
day
?
?
In
the
tool
crib
she
can't
get
away
''
.
``
What
the
hell
do
I
care
what
you
do
with
her
all
day
?
?
Just
get
her
where
Guardino
won't
see
her
and
start
asking
questions
''
.
Grosse
swore
now
.
``
Dammit
all
,
Vince
.
I
ain't
no
baby
sitter
''
.
Vince
shouted
finally
,
``
Get
her
over
to
Rose's
and
I'll
come
by
and
see
that
she
stays
put
''
.
Grosse
rubbed
the
bridge
of
his
nose
where
it
was
swollen
.
He
spoke
sullenly
.
``
You
don't
hafta
get
nasty
.
I
wish
you
luck
when
you
try
scaring
that
kid
''
.
Suddenly
he
grinned
.
His
voice
lost
its
sullen
tones
and
he
chuckled
.
``
I
got
one
question
''
.
``
What
is
it
''
?
?
Impatiently
.
``
Are
you
a
poor
dumb
Canadian
or
a
smart
aleck
from
the
States
''
?
?
Vince
lifted
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
,
but
his
thin
lips
spread
in
a
smile
.
Grosse
ducked
and
sniggered
.
``
Where'd
you
say
you
was
born
''
?
?
``
In
a
Chicago
slum
just
like
you
.
And
I
ain't
going
back
there
on
account
of
one
lousy
kid
''
.
Lauren
Landis
rubbed
her
face
against
the
blanket
.
She
had
cried
a
little
because
she
was
frightened
.
She
could
easily
understand
why
the
two
men
had
been
startled
to
find
a
strange
girl
in
the
back
seat
of
their
car
(
she
had
figured
that
out
)
,
but
she
couldn't
understand
their
subsequent
actions
.
Was
it
because
she
had
shown
panic
?
?
Who
could
blame
her
for
that
?
?
It
was
one
thing
to
awaken
outside
a
restaurant
where
your
parents
were
eating
and
quite
another
to
awaken
in
a
strange
garage
and
know
your
parents
had
gone
on
home
without
you
.
She
was
glad
the
fat
man
had
left
.
Barney
was
not
really
frightening
.
She
jumped
as
the
little
man
now
appeared
at
the
window
and
,
reaching
through
the
opening
,
offered
her
a
bottle
of
coke
.
She
smiled
at
him
wetly
.
Although
she
found
she
was
thirsty
,
she
was
about
to
refuse
(
never
,
never
take
candy
from
a
strange
man
)
when
she
saw
the
bottle
was
unopened
.
He
placed
a
bottle
opener
on
the
counter
.
So
,
he
understood
her
panic
.
She
blew
her
nose
on
a
tissue
and
opened
the
coke
bottle
.
It
was
icy
cold
and
tasted
delicious
.
She
felt
a
lift
in
spirit
.
When
she
was
finished
she
pushed
it
back
.
The
man
was
busy
doing
something
to
the
inside
of
the
door-frame
on
the
driver's
side
of
a
car
.
She
called
softly
,
``
Barney
''
.
He
looked
in
her
direction
but
he
didn't
answer
.
She
said
,
``
Barney
,
why
is
he
keeping
me
here
''
?
?
Still
no
answer
.
He
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
point
above
the
little
window
.
Lauren
said
,
``
Why
can't
I
call
my
home
?
?
Or
borrow
some
money
from
someone
and
go
home
by
bus
?
?
I
could
send
the
money
right
back
''
.
Barney
finished
the
cigarette
he
had
been
smoking
.
He
dropped
it
and
carefully
ground
it
to
nothing
with
the
sole
of
his
heavy
shoe
.
Now
he
looked
at
her
.
He
said
,
``
I
only
work
here
''
.
Lauren
said
,
``
Please
''
?
?
But
he
was
back
at
work
on
a
car
.
She
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
counter
.
How
could
he
be
kind
one
moment
and
cruel
the
next
?
?
Did
he
know
something
that
made
him
feel
sad
and
sorry
for
her
?
?
And
was
he
afraid
to
do
anything
as
definite
as
releasing
her
?
?
Her
heart
was
thumping
painfully
;
;
the
unknown
was
so
much
worse
than
--
what
dangers
lay
ahead
for
her
?
?
What
awful
thing
had
she
to
face
in
the
next
few
hours
?
?
Something
wet
and
hot
was
trickling
on
her
wrists
.
Tears
?
?
With
a
sturdy
act
of
will
she
turned
her
mind
away
from
herself
;
;
as
long
as
she
could
do
nothing
constructive
about
the
situation
she
was
in
,
she
would
think
about
something
else
.
Her
mother
and
father
,
for
instance
.
Where
were
they
now
?
?
In
her
mind
she
followed
the
white
Buick
along
the
road
somewhere
between
here
and
the
Niagara
River
.
Her
father's
attention
would
be
on
the
road
ahead
and
it
wouldn't
deviate
an
inch
until
he
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
Falls
and
took
the
River
Road
to
LaSalle
and
,
finally
,
turned
in
at
their
own
driveway
at
387
Heather
Heights
.
Then
he
would
yawn
and
stretch
and
shout
,
``
All
out
.
This
is
the
end
of
the
line
''
.
And
what
would
her
mother
be
doing
right
now
?
?
Her
mother
would
be
fast
asleep
curled
up
against
that
wonderful
,
big
,
safe
,
solid
shoulder
next
to
her
on
the
front
seat
.
Lauren
Landis
was
in
trouble
and
she
was
alone
.
Roberta
Landis
put
her
hand
on
her
husband's
arm
as
he
slid
in
the
driver's
seat
beside
her
.
Somewhere
birds
were
sweetly
calling
,
were
answered
.
Her
teeth
chattered
so
that
she
made
three
attempts
at
speech
before
she
became
intelligible
.
``
Dave
.
I
saw
that
woman's
apron
behind
the
door
.
There
was
a
wet
spot
--
she
couldn't
have
been
gone
long
''
.
Dave
made
some
sound
meant
to
convey
agreement
.
He
inserted
the
car
key
in
the
lock
.
Roberta
was
violently
trembling
.
She
stammered
,
``
You
heard
what
he
said
about
police
?
?
Why
don't
we
drive
around
the
corner
''
?
?
The
car
door
crashed
shut
.
The
engine
throbbed
into
life
.
Dave
said
,
``
I
got
the
message
.
We're
going
''
.
Roberta
said
,
``
no
.
You
go
.
Walk
.
Suppose
Lauren
comes
looking
for
us
?
?
I
can
sit
here
in
the
car
while
you
walk
around
the
corner
''
.
The
big
car
sprang
away
from
the
curb
like
something
alive
.
He
said
,
``
I'm
not
going
to
leave
my
wife
and
my
car
out
here
in
sight
of
those
''
--
Roberta
glanced
at
him
and
stopped
trembling
.
His
jowls
were
spiked
by
barbs
of
graying
beard
.
His
small
,
mean
eyes
regarded
Marty
steadily
,
unblinkingly
.
His
eyes
were
threaded
by
little
filaments
of
red
as
if
tiny
veins
had
burst
and
flooded
blood
into
them
.
As
he
chewed
his
gum
and
exuded
wheezing
breath
,
Marty
smelt
the
reek
of
bad
whiskey
.
Marty
recognized
the
man
.
He
had
driven
the
car
that
passed
them
on
the
road
outside
Admassy's
place
.
This
was
Acey
Squire
,
proprietor
of
the
juke
joint
.
Marty
smiled
at
Squire
pleasantly
and
said
,
``
There
was
a
cab
waiting
for
me
here
.
Do
you
know
where
it
might
have
gone
''
?
?
Squire
chewed
his
gum
,
his
jaw
moving
in
a
steady
rhythm
.
He
looked
straight
at
Marty
.
He
did
not
answer
.
Marty
scanned
the
faces
of
the
others
nearest
him
,
looked
into
their
staring
eyes
.
``
Did
anyone
see
my
cab
''
?
?
He
asked
,
keeping
his
voice
casual
.
He
avoided
showing
any
surprise
or
annoyance
when
no
one
answered
him
.
``
I
have
to
get
back
to
Jarrodsville
''
,
he
went
on
.
``
I
see
there
are
some
cars
here
.
I
wonder
if
one
of
you
gentlemen
could
drive
me
back
to
town
?
?
I'd
be
happy
to
pay
for
the
favor
,
of
course
''
.
The
seventeen
men
stood
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
longer
.
And
then
a
startling
thing
occurred
.
It
was
so
utterly
unexpected
that
Marty
stood
for
several
moments
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
foolishly
after
it
had
happened
.
There
was
no
word
spoken
,
no
apparent
signal
given
.
Yet
the
men
all
moved
at
the
same
instant
.
They
piled
into
the
waiting
cars
,
motors
roared
,
the
cars
sped
off
.
The
station
wagon
and
the
old
Plymouth
headed
east
toward
Jarrodsville
.
The
Ford
and
the
pickup
truck
sped
west
toward
Sanford's
Run
.
In
seconds
all
four
cars
were
out
of
sight
.
Marty
Land
stood
alone
on
a
red-clay
road
as
storm
clouds
gathered
ominously
in
the
sky
again
.
From
a
great
distance
thunder
growled
and
broke
the
silence
.
Land
looked
back
toward
the
dilapidated
house
.
He
thought
he
saw
a
pale
face
at
a
window
.
Perhaps
it
was
Dora
May
.
Perhaps
she
would
be
glad
that
they
hadn't
hurt
him
.
There
were
other
farmhouses
nearby
.
Across
the
road
there
was
one
no
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
.
There
was
another
on
this
side
,
a
little
further
down
.
There
were
many
more
between
here
and
Jarrodsville
.
Telephone
poles
lined
the
road
.
They
reared
tall
and
mocking
.
Their
wires
stretched
out
into
infinity
.
Not
a
single
strand
of
wire
reached
into
the
silent
houses
beside
the
red-clay
road
.
There
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
walk
.
And
Jarrodsville
was
more
than
three
miles
away
,
down
an
old
dirt
road
that
the
rain
had
turned
into
a
quagmire
.
Marty
faced
east
and
started
walking
down
the
left
side
of
the
road
.
After
he
had
proceeded
a
few
feet
,
he
paused
and
turned
up
the
cuffs
of
his
trousers
,
which
were
already
damp
and
mud-caked
.
The
viscous
mud
was
ankle-deep
,
and
in
places
great
puddles
spread
across
the
road
and
reflected
the
murky
light
.
As
he
approached
the
first
farmhouse
,
thunder
sounded
behind
him
again
,
closer
now
and
louder
,
like
a
steadily
advancing
drum
corps
.
There
were
several
people
on
the
porch
of
the
farmhouse
.
There
was
a
very
old
man
and
a
young
woman
and
a
brood
of
children
ranging
from
toddlers
to
teen-agers
.
For
just
an
instant
he
thought
of
appealing
to
them
for
help
.
Perhaps
they
had
a
car
or
truck
and
would
drive
him
into
town
.
Then
he
realized
the
utter
futility
of
the
idea
.
They
were
staring
at
him
in
the
same
blank
and
menacing
way
that
the
men
outside
the
gate
had
stared
.
Even
the
eyes
of
the
smallest
children
seemed
malicious
.
On
his
side
of
the
road
there
were
two
farm
hands
,
well
back
in
a
field
,
leaning
against
a
plow
.
They
,
too
,
stared
at
him
.
The
drums
of
thunder
were
right
behind
him
now
.
A
foolish
thought
came
into
his
head
.
He
remembered
a
story
he
had
read
as
a
youth
.
It
was
probably
one
of
Kipling's
tales
of
the
British
Army
.
It
concerned
an
officer
who
had
been
disgraced
and
drummed
out
.
The
steady
roll
of
the
drums
had
sounded
behind
him
as
he
walked
between
the
endless
ranks
of
the
men
he
had
commanded
,
and
each
man
about-faced
and
turned
his
back
as
the
officer
approached
.
Marty
wished
these
poor
farm
people
would
turn
their
backs
.
The
fencing
by
the
roadside
ended
.
Now
the
dirt
highway
was
bordered
on
either
side
by
a
fairly
deep
drainage
ditch
,
too
broad
to
leap
over
unless
you
were
an
Olympic
star
.
The
day's
rain
had
been
added
to
the
stagnant
water
.
He
was
trapped
on
the
road
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
car
.
It
was
coming
toward
him
.
The
car
was
now
in
sight
.
Marty's
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
he
recognized
it
.
It
was
the
station
wagon
that
had
passed
his
cab
on
the
road
,
the
station
wagon
that
had
been
parked
at
the
Burch
farm
.
Acey
Squire's
station
wagon
.
It
had
headed
back
toward
Jarrodsville
.
That
had
only
been
a
ruse
to
lure
him
out
on
the
deserted
road
.
Now
Acey
and
his
friends
were
returning
to
seek
him
out
.
The
station
wagon
came
to
a
stop
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
in
front
of
him
,
beside
a
fenced
field
.
Then
there
was
another
sound
.
A
second
car
was
coming
from
the
west
,
from
the
direction
of
Sanford's
Run
.
It
was
the
Ford
that
had
been
outside
Burch's
farm
.
Marty
looked
helplessly
in
both
directions
.
It
was
a
narrow
road
,
barely
wide
enough
for
two
cars
to
pass
.
He
could
not
leave
the
road
because
of
the
water-filled
drainage
ditch
.
When
the
two
cars
were
equidistant
from
him
,
the
station
wagon
started
up
again
and
the
Ford
gathered
speed
.
They
bore
down
on
him
.
There
was
nothing
he
could
do
except
jump
into
the
ditch
.
He
jumped
,
and
sank
to
his
knees
in
muddy
water
.
As
the
two
cars
roared
by
,
there
was
a
high-pitched
eerie
,
nerve-shattering
sound
.
Marty
knew
how
the
Union
soldiers
must
have
felt
at
Chancellorsville
and
Antietam
and
Gettysburg
when
the
ragged
gray
ranks
charged
at
them
,
screaming
the
wild
banshee
howl
they
called
the
Rebel
yell
.
For
moments
he
stood
in
water
,
shivering
and
gasping
for
breath
.
He
had
turned
his
ankle
slightly
,
and
it
pained
him
.
The
cars
,
with
their
load
of
howling
men
,
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
.
There
had
been
two
more
cars
parked
at
the
farm
,
a
Plymouth
and
a
pickup
truck
.
They
would
be
coming
for
him
next
,
bearing
down
on
him
from
both
directions
.
And
then
the
station
wagon
and
the
Ford
would
seek
him
out
again
.
He
would
be
harassed
repeatedly
and
would
escape
death
by
inches
time
after
time
,
all
the
way
to
Jarrodsville
.
He
still
had
three
miles
to
go
.
Back
East
the
more
affluent
juvenile
delinquents
,
who
could
afford
hyped-up
autos
instead
of
switch
blades
as
lethal
weapons
,
played
this
same
game
and
called
it
``
Chicken
''
.
He
could
not
go
through
the
fields
.
That
way
was
barred
on
both
sides
of
the
road
by
a
high
barbed-wire
fence
.
He
had
to
make
for
the
section
of
road
just
ahead
that
was
bordered
by
the
rail
fence
,
the
section
by
the
farmhouse
.
At
least
he
could
climb
up
on
the
fence
when
his
tormenters
roared
by
again
.
The
Admassy
place
could
not
be
far
now
.
He
would
go
in
there
,
climb
through
the
window
,
and
at
least
be
safe
for
a
little
while
and
able
to
rest
.
There
was
even
a
bare
chance
that
the
phone
had
not
been
disconnected
.
He
did
not
dare
climb
back
up
to
the
road
.
He
was
deep
in
water
,
but
at
least
they
could
not
reach
him
there
.
He
splashed
on
,
mud
sucking
at
his
feet
with
each
step
,
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
drainage
ditch
and
the
beginning
of
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
farm
.
He
climbed
back
to
the
road
,
and
he
felt
utterly
exhausted
.
He
stood
,
panting
,
for
a
moment
.
And
then
he
saw
something
that
he
had
not
seen
before
,
and
panic
gripped
him
again
.
The
fence
,
his
only
refuge
when
the
metal
death
came
roaring
at
him
,
was
made
of
rails
,
all
right
,
but
the
rails
were
protected
by
a
thick
screening
of
barbed
wire
that
would
rip
his
flesh
if
he
pressed
against
it
.
He
lurched
on
down
the
road
despairingly
,
because
there
was
no
place
else
to
go
.
He
lost
all
sense
of
dignity
.
You
could
not
stand
on
dignity
when
you
were
soaked
and
muddied
and
your
life
was
at
stake
.
Probably
people
were
watching
him
from
the
porch
or
from
behind
the
windows
of
this
farmhouse
,
too
,
but
he
did
not
bother
to
look
.
He
broke
into
a
dogtrot
,
breathing
heavily
,
streaming
with
sweat
.
He
had
to
reach
Admassy's
place
.
It
was
his
only
sanctuary
.
The
fences
on
both
sides
of
the
road
bristled
with
the
barbed
wire
.
The
fences
stretched
on
endlessly
.
And
then
he
heard
them
.
And
now
he
saw
them
.
The
Plymouth
was
coming
at
him
from
the
east
,
the
pickup
truck
from
the
west
.
They
had
timed
it
better
this
time
.
They
would
reach
him
at
almost
exactly
the
same
instant
.
He
stopped
stone-still
.
If
he
backed
against
the
fence
,
one
of
the
cars
would
brush
him
as
it
passed
,
and
he
would
be
cruelly
lacerated
by
the
wire
.
He
stumbled
to
the
middle
of
the
road
and
simply
stood
there
,
waiting
for
them
,
a
perfect
target
.
The
cars
must
have
had
their
gas
pedals
pushed
down
to
the
floor
boards
.
They
were
coming
on
at
reckless
speed
for
such
old
vehicles
.
They
thundered
at
him
.
He
held
his
arms
close
to
his
sides
and
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
.
When
the
Plymouth
neared
,
it
veered
toward
him
and
seemed
about
to
run
him
down
.
He
forced
himself
to
stay
frozen
there
.
If
he
moved
,
he
would
be
in
the
path
of
the
other
car
.
He
thought
the
fender
of
the
Plymouth
brushed
his
jacket
as
it
went
by
.
In
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
pickup
truck
hurtled
by
on
the
other
side
.
The
weird
,
insane
sound
of
the
Rebel
yell
reverberated
again
and
echoed
from
the
distant
hills
.
He
did
not
leave
the
middle
of
the
road
.
He
did
not
try
to
run
.
He
trudged
on
,
his
aching
eyes
focused
straight
ahead
.
He
was
nearing
the
Admassy
house
.
He
was
going
to
make
it
,
he
told
himself
.
And
then
he
heard
a
car
coming
from
the
east
,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
would
break
down
and
weep
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
again
''
,
he
said
aloud
.
``
Not
again
so
soon
''
.
There
was
a
new
sound
,
a
sound
as
piercing
as
the
Rebel
yell
,
yet
different
.
It
was
the
sound
of
a
siren
.
Now
he
saw
that
the
approaching
car
was
painted
white
,
and
he
began
to
wave
his
arms
