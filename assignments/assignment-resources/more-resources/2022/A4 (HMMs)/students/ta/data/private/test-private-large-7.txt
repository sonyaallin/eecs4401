The
platform
angle
**yf
is
the
angle
about
which
the
gyro
is
controlling
.
This
is
normally
termed
the
gyro
input
axis
,
90-degrees
away
from
the
gyro
output
or
**yj
axis
.
The
gyro
angular
momentum
is
defined
by
H
.
Thus
if
the
gyro
and
platform-controller
combination
maintains
the
platform
with
zero
angular
deviation
about
the
**yf
axis
,
the
system
can
be
rotated
with
an
angular
velocity
Af
if
a
torque
is
supplied
to
the
gyro
output
axis
Aj
.
It
is
assumed
that
the
gyros
are
designed
with
electrical
torquers
so
that
a
torque
can
be
applied
about
their
output
axes
.
In
the
system
shown
in
Fig.
7-1
,
the
accelerometer
output
is
amplified
and
the
resulting
voltage
is
applied
to
the
gyro
output-axis
torquer
.
This
torque
causes
the
entire
system
to
rotate
about
the
**yf
axis
,
since
the
response
to
Af
.
If
the
polarities
are
correct
,
the
platform
rotates
in
such
a
direction
as
to
reduce
the
accelerometer
output
to
zero
.
As
the
accelerometer
output
is
decreasing
,
the
torque
applied
to
the
gyro
output
axis
decreases
and
,
therefore
,
the
rate
decreases
.
Finally
,
when
the
accelerometer
output
is
zero
,
the
entire
system
remains
stationary
,
and
the
platform
is
,
by
definition
,
leveled
.
A
mathematical
block
diagram
for
the
leveling
system
is
shown
in
Fig.
7-2
.
The
platform
is
initially
off
level
by
the
angle
Aj
.
The
angle
generated
by
the
platform
servo
**yf
multiplied
by
G
is
the
effective
acceleration
acting
on
the
accelerometer
.
Af
is
the
scale
factor
of
the
accelerometer
(
Af
)
.
The
voltage
Af
is
amplified
by
Af
and
applied
to
the
gyro
torquer
with
scale
factor
Af
.
Finally
,
the
gyro-stabilized
platform
characteristic
is
represented
by
Af
.
The
system
as
indicated
in
Fig.
7-2
is
fundamental
and
simple
because
the
transient
effects
of
both
the
platform
servo
and
the
accelerometer
have
been
neglected
.
With
these
factors
included
,
an
upper
limit
is
placed
on
the
allowable
loop
gain
by
stability
considerations
.
In
this
type
of
system
,
a
high
loop
gain
is
desirable
because
it
provides
a
fast
response
time
.
When
the
frequency
response
characteristics
of
practical
components
are
considered
,
their
effect
on
stability
does
not
present
the
most
serious
limit
on
the
system
loop
gain
.
The
time
required
for
the
system
to
reach
a
level
position
is
approximately
inversely
proportional
to
the
servo
loop
gain
.
In
addition
,
the
cutoff
frequency
for
input
accelerations
is
approximately
proportional
to
the
servo
loop
gain
;
;
i.e.
,
high
loop
gain
causes
the
system
to
respond
to
horizontal
components
of
accelerations
.
This
problem
usually
determines
the
lower
limit
of
loop
gain
rather
than
response
time
.
It
must
be
noticed
in
Fig.
7-1
that
the
accelerometer
responds
to
any
input
acceleration
.
The
equation
relating
input
acceleration
to
output
platform
angle
is
Af
.
In
practice
,
the
preflight
leveling
process
takes
place
with
the
system
mounted
in
the
airframe
.
When
the
system
is
arranged
for
automatic
leveling
,
the
platform
angles
respond
to
any
horizontal
components
of
acceleration
acting
on
the
accelerometers
.
There
are
many
such
components
of
acceleration
present
due
to
the
effect
of
wind
gusts
,
engine
noise
,
turbulence
around
the
vehicle
,
etc.
.
One
of
the
greatest
problems
associated
with
automatic
leveling
is
establishing
a
true
level
in
the
presence
of
high-level
acceleration
noise
.
One
solution
to
the
problem
is
to
operate
with
a
low
loop
gain
and
to
include
low-pass
filters
.
This
technique
causes
the
system
to
respond
only
to
low
frequency
acceleration
components
such
as
the
platform
tilt
.
Since
a
lower
loop
gain
and
low-pass
filtering
increases
the
response
time
,
a
practical
compromise
must
be
reached
.
One
of
the
most
desirable
solutions
is
achieved
by
the
use
of
a
non-linear
amplifier
for
Af
.
The
amplifier
is
designed
so
that
its
gain
is
large
for
accelerometer
signals
above
a
certain
threshold
level
.
Below
this
level
,
the
amplifier
gain
Af
is
proportional
and
is
of
small
value
,
in
order
to
provide
adequate
noise
filtering
.
The
effect
is
that
the
platform
returns
from
an
off-level
position
at
a
rapid
rate
until
it
is
nearly
level
,
at
which
point
the
platform
is
controlled
by
a
proportional
servo
with
low
enough
frequency
response
so
that
the
noise
has
little
effect
on
the
leveling
process
.
When
the
system
is
on
automatic
leveling
,
the
gyro
drift
is
canceled
by
the
output
of
the
leveling
system
(
amplifier
Af
)
.
The
platform
actually
tilts
off
level
so
that
the
accelerometer
output
,
when
amplified
by
Af
,
will
supply
the
correct
current
to
the
gyro
torquer
to
cancel
the
gyro
drift
.
The
amount
of
platform
dip
required
depends
upon
the
scale
factors
of
the
system
.
7-3
.
Practical
leveling
considerations
.
The
automatic
leveling
system
described
in
this
section
is
readily
adaptable
to
a
gyro-stabilized
platform
consisting
of
three
integrating
gyros
.
The
system
requires
some
switching
of
flight
equipment
circuits
.
However
,
the
leveling
operation
can
be
maintained
and
controlled
remotely
with
no
mechanical
or
optical
contact
with
the
platform
.
This
leveling
system
will
hold
the
platform
on-level
,
automatically
,
as
long
as
the
system
is
actuated
.
A
useful
by-product
of
this
system
is
that
the
information
necessary
to
set
the
gyro
drift
biases
is
available
from
the
currents
necessary
to
hold
the
system
in
level
.
The
leveling
process
can
be
accomplished
manually
,
and
the
results
are
as
satisfactory
as
those
obtained
with
automatic
equipment
.
The
process
consists
in
turning
the
platform
manually
until
the
outputs
of
both
accelerometers
are
zero
.
The
turning
is
accomplished
by
applying
voltage
to
the
gyro
torquers
described
above
.
In
brief
,
the
human
replaces
amplifier
Af
in
Figs.
7-1
and
7-2
.
Manual
leveling
requires
an
appropriate
display
of
the
accelerometer
outputs
.
If
high
accuracy
is
required
in
preflight
leveling
,
it
is
usually
necessary
to
integrate
or
doubly
integrate
the
accelerometer
outputs
(
this
also
minimizes
the
noise
problem
)
.
With
integration
,
the
effect
of
a
small
acceleration
(
or
small
platform
tilt
angle
)
can
be
seen
after
a
time
.
However
,
skill
is
required
on
the
part
of
an
operator
to
level
a
platform
to
any
degree
of
accuracy
.
Also
,
it
requires
more
time
as
compared
to
the
automatic
approach
.
Manual
leveling
is
inconvenient
if
the
platform
must
be
maintained
accurately
level
for
any
prolonged
period
of
time
.
The
operator
must
continually
supply
the
correct
amount
of
turning
current
to
the
gyro
torquers
so
that
the
effect
of
gyro
drift
is
canceled
.
This
process
is
especially
difficult
since
gyro
drifting
is
typically
random
.
7-4
.
Platform
heading
.
Platform
heading
consists
of
orienting
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
accelerometers
parallel
to
the
desired
coordinate
system
of
the
navigator
.
In
simpler
terms
,
it
amounts
to
pointing
the
platform
in
the
proper
direction
.
For
purely
inertial
navigators
,
two
techniques
are
available
to
accomplish
the
platform
heading
:
Use
of
external
or
surveying
equipment
to
establish
proper
heading
;
;
Use
of
the
characteristics
of
the
platform
components
for
an
indication
of
true
heading
.
The
choice
of
the
heading
technique
is
dependent
upon
the
accuracy
requirements
,
field
conditions
,
and
the
time
available
to
accomplish
the
heading
.
7-5
.
External
determination
of
heading
--
surveying
technique
.
With
the
gyro-stabilized
platform
leveled
,
it
can
be
headed
in
the
proper
direction
by
using
surveying
techniques
.
The
platform
accelerometers
must
be
slightly
modified
for
this
procedure
.
Before
the
accelerometers
are
mounted
on
the
platform
,
the
direction
of
their
sensitive
axis
must
be
accurately
determined
.
A
mirror
is
mounted
on
each
accelerometer
so
that
the
plane
of
the
mirror
is
perpendicular
to
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
unit
.
Transit
.
A
precision
transit
is
set
up
so
that
it
is
aligned
with
respect
to
true
north
.
This
can
be
done
to
a
high
degree
of
accuracy
by
existing
surveying
techniques
.
With
the
transit
set
up
,
a
mirror
on
one
of
the
accelerometers
is
sighted
and
the
platform
is
turned
until
it
is
aligned
.
The
sighting
procedure
includes
the
use
of
a
fixture
for
the
transit
to
project
a
beam
of
light
,
which
is
darkened
by
crossed
hairs
,
on
the
accelerometer
mirror
.
When
the
platform
is
aligned
,
the
reflected
image
of
the
crossed
hairs
can
be
seen
exactly
superimposed
upon
the
original
crossed
hairs
.
The
images
can
easily
be
aligned
with
a
high
degree
of
accuracy
.
The
platform
is
turned
as
required
by
supplying
currents
to
the
appropriate
gyro
torquers
.
Although
this
technique
is
simple
and
satisfactory
,
one
practical
difficulty
does
exist
:
the
direction
of
true
north
must
be
known
for
each
launch
point
.
However
,
this
difficulty
is
not
too
serious
if
it
is
realized
that
a
surveying
team
can
establish
a
true
north
base
line
with
a
few
days'
work
.
In
many
installations
,
the
inertial
platform
is
raised
off
the
ground
a
considerable
height
when
it
is
mounted
in
the
vehicle
before
flight
.
With
this
situation
,
it
is
difficult
to
sight
in
on
the
platform
with
surveying
equipment
.
If
the
platform
is
not
too
high
off
the
ground
,
a
transit
can
be
mounted
on
a
stand
to
raise
it
up
to
the
platform
.
Obviously
,
the
heading
accuracy
is
lessened
by
such
techniques
since
errors
are
introduced
because
of
motion
of
the
stand
.
Autocollimator
.
The
transit
can
be
replaced
by
an
autocollimator
.
This
instrument
provides
an
electrical
signal
proportional
to
the
angular
deviations
of
the
platform
and
can
be
used
to
automatically
hold
the
platform
on
true
heading
.
The
electrical
signal
from
the
autocollimator
is
amplified
and
supplied
to
the
Z-gyro
torquer
.
If
the
polarity
is
correct
,
the
platform
will
turn
until
the
heading
error
angle
is
zero
.
Information
is
also
available
from
this
autocollimator
system
to
set
the
drift
bias
for
the
Z-axis
gyro
.
If
the
Z
gyro
is
drifting
,
a
current
generated
by
the
autocollimator
is
delivered
to
the
gyro
torquer
to
cancel
the
drift
.
If
the
drift
error
is
systematic
,
it
can
be
canceled
with
a
bias
circuit
which
can
be
arranged
and
adjusted
to
supply
the
required
compensating
current
.
Electrical
pickoffs
.
It
is
possible
to
locate
an
angular
electrical
pickoff
,
which
will
indicate
the
angular
deviation
between
the
true
heading
direction
and
the
platform
.
Essentially
,
the
stator
or
reference
portion
of
the
pickoff
is
established
with
respect
to
the
true
heading
direction
,
and
the
platform
is
turned
either
manually
or
automatically
until
the
angular
electrical
pickoff
signal
is
reduced
to
zero
.
7-6
.
Gyrocompass
heading
.
Gyrocompass
alignment
is
an
automatic
heading
system
which
depends
upon
the
characteristic
of
one
gyro
to
establish
true
heading
.
For
the
case
of
a
purely
inertial
autonavigator
consisting
of
three
restrained
gyros
,
a
coordinate
system
is
used
where
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
X
accelerometer
is
parallel
to
the
east-west
direction
at
the
base
point
,
and
the
Y
accelerometer
sensitive
axis
is
parallel
to
the
north-south
direction
at
the
base
point
.
The
accelerometers
are
mounted
rigidly
on
the
platform
.
Thus
,
if
one
accelerometer
is
properly
aligned
,
the
other
is
also
.
The
input
axis
of
the
appropriate
gyros
are
parallel
to
the
sensitive
direction
of
the
accelerometers
.
Figure
7-3
shows
a
platform
system
with
the
gyro
vectors
arranged
as
described
above
.
The
platform
is
leveled
and
properly
headed
,
so
that
the
X-gyro
input
axis
is
parallel
to
the
east-west
direction
and
the
Y-gyro
input
axis
is
parallel
to
the
north-south
direction
.
The
input
axis
of
the
X
gyro
,
when
pointing
in
the
east-west
direction
,
is
always
perpendicular
to
the
spin
axis
of
earth
.
If
the
platform
is
not
properly
headed
,
the
X-gyro
input
axis
will
see
a
component
of
the
earth's
rotation
.
The
sensing
of
this
rotation
by
the
X
gyro
can
be
utilized
to
direct
the
platform
into
proper
heading
.
In
Fig.
7-4
,
the
input
axis
of
the
three-axis
platform
is
shown
at
some
point
on
the
earth
.
The
point
is
at
a
latitude
**yl
,
and
the
platform
is
at
an
error
in
heading
east
.
The
earth
is
spinning
at
an
angular
velocity
**zq
equal
to
one
revolution
per
24
hr.
.
When
the
platform
is
level
,
**ye
is
a
rotation
about
the
Z
axis
of
the
platform
Af
.
Since
the
earth
is
rotating
and
the
unleveled
gyro-stabilized
platform
is
fixed
with
respect
to
a
reference
in
space
,
an
observer
on
the
earth
will
see
the
platform
rotating
(
with
respect
to
the
earth
)
.
Thirty-three
Scotty
did
not
go
back
to
school
.
His
parents
talked
seriously
and
lengthily
to
their
own
doctor
and
to
a
specialist
at
the
University
Hospital
--
Mr.
McKinley
was
entitled
to
a
discount
for
members
of
his
family
--
and
it
was
decided
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
take
the
remainder
of
the
term
off
,
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
bed
and
,
for
the
rest
,
do
pretty
much
as
he
chose
--
provided
,
of
course
,
he
chose
to
do
nothing
too
exciting
or
too
debilitating
.
His
teacher
and
his
school
principal
were
conferred
with
and
everyone
agreed
that
,
if
he
kept
up
with
a
certain
amount
of
work
at
home
,
there
was
little
danger
of
his
losing
a
term
.
Scotty
accepted
the
decision
with
indifference
and
did
not
enter
the
arguments
.
He
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
after
a
two-day
checkup
and
he
and
his
parents
had
what
Mr.
McKinley
described
as
a
``
celebration
lunch
''
at
the
cafeteria
on
the
campus
.
Rachel
wore
a
smart
hat
and
,
because
she
had
been
warned
recently
about
smoking
,
puffed
at
her
cigarettes
through
a
long
ivory
holder
stained
with
lipstick
.
Scotty's
father
sat
sprawled
in
his
chair
,
angular
,
alert
as
a
cricket
,
looking
about
at
the
huge
stainless-steel
appointments
of
the
room
with
an
expression
of
proprietorship
.
Teachers
--
men
who
wore
brown
suits
and
had
gray
hair
and
pleasant
smiles
--
came
to
their
table
to
talk
shop
and
to
be
introduced
to
Scotty
and
Rachel
.
Rachel
was
polite
,
Scotty
indifferent
.
They
ate
the
cafeteria
food
with
its
orange
sauces
and
Scotty
gazed
without
interest
at
his
food
,
the
teachers
,
the
heroic
baronial
windows
,
and
the
bright
ranks
of
college
banners
.
His
father
tried
to
make
the
food
a
topic
.
``
The
blueberry
pie
is
good
,
Scotty
.
I
recommend
it
''
.
He
looked
at
his
son
,
his
face
worried
.
Scotty
murmured
,
``
No
,
thanks
''
,
so
softly
his
father
had
to
bend
his
gaunt
height
across
the
table
and
turn
a
round
brown
ear
to
him
.
Scotty
regarded
the
ear
and
the
grizzled
hair
around
it
with
a
moment
of
interest
.
He
said
more
loudly
,
``
I'm
full
,
old
Pop
''
.
He
had
eaten
almost
nothing
on
the
crested
,
three-sectioned
plate
and
had
drunk
about
half
the
milk
in
its
paper
container
.
``
He's
all
right
,
Craig
''
,
Rachel
said
.
``
I
can
fix
him
something
later
in
the
afternoon
when
we
get
home
''
.
Since
his
seizure
,
Scotty
had
had
little
appetite
;
;
yet
his
changed
appearance
,
surprisingly
,
was
one
of
plumpness
.
His
face
was
fuller
;
;
his
lips
and
the
usually
sharp
lines
of
his
jaw
had
become
swollen-looking
.
He
breathed
now
with
his
mouth
open
,
showing
a
whitely
curving
section
of
lower
teeth
;
;
he
kept
his
eyes
,
with
their
puffed
blurred
lids
,
always
lowered
,
though
not
,
apparently
,
focusing
.
Even
his
neck
seemed
thicker
and
,
therefore
,
shorter
.
His
hands
,
which
had
been
as
quick
as
a
pair
of
fluttering
birds
,
were
now
neither
active
nor
really
relaxed
.
They
lay
on
his
lap
,
palms
up
,
stiffly
motionless
,
the
tapered
fingers
a
little
thick
at
the
joints
.
Altogether
he
had
,
since
the
seizure
,
the
appearance
of
a
boy
who
overindulged
in
food
and
took
no
exercise
.
He
looked
lazy
,
spoiled
,
a
little
querulous
.
Rachel
had
little
to
say
.
She
greeted
her
husband's
colleagues
with
smiling
politeness
,
offering
nothing
.
Mr.
McKinley
,
for
all
his
sprawling
and
his
easy
familiarity
,
was
completely
alert
to
his
son
,
eyes
always
on
the
still
face
,
jumping
to
anticipate
Scotty's
desires
.
It
was
a
strained
,
silent
lunch
.
Rachel
said
,
``
I'd
better
get
him
to
bed
''
.
The
doctors
had
suggested
Scotty
remain
most
of
every
afternoon
in
bed
until
he
was
stronger
.
Since
Mr.
McKinley
had
to
give
a
lecture
,
Rachel
and
Scotty
drove
home
alone
in
the
Plymouth
.
They
did
not
speak
much
.
Scotty
gazed
out
at
ugly
gray
slums
and
said
softly
,
``
Look
at
those
stupid
kids
''
.
It
was
a
Negro
section
of
peeling
row
houses
,
store-front
churches
and
ragged
children
.
Rachel
had
to
bend
toward
Scotty
and
ask
him
to
repeat
.
He
said
,
``
Nothing
''
.
And
then
:
``
There
are
lots
of
kids
around
here
''
.
Scotty
looked
at
the
children
,
his
mouth
slightly
opened
,
his
eyes
dull
.
He
felt
tired
and
full
and
calm
.
Thirty-four
the
days
seemed
short
,
perhaps
because
his
routine
was
,
each
day
,
almost
the
same
.
He
rose
late
and
went
down
in
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
to
have
breakfast
either
alone
or
with
Rachel
.
Virginia
treated
him
with
attention
and
tried
to
tempt
his
appetite
with
special
food
:
biscuits
,
cookies
,
candies
--
the
result
of
devoted
hours
in
the
tiled
kitchen
.
She
would
hover
over
him
and
,
looking
like
her
brother
,
anxiously
watch
the
progress
of
Scotty's
fork
or
spoon
.
``
You
don't
eat
enough
,
honey
.
Try
to
get
that
down
''
.
Rachel
,
observing
,
would
say
,
``
He
has
to
rediscover
his
own
capacity
.
It'll
take
time
''
.
Virginia
and
Rachel
talked
to
each
other
quietly
now
,
as
allies
who
are
political
rather
than
natural
might
in
a
war
atmosphere
.
Both
watched
Scotty
constantly
,
Rachel
without
seeming
to
,
Virginia
openly
,
her
eyes
filled
with
concern
.
Scotty
was
neutral
.
He
did
not
resent
their
supervision
or
Virginia's
sometimes
tiring
sympathy
.
He
ate
what
he
felt
like
,
slept
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
pleased
,
and
moved
about
the
draughty
rooms
of
the
house
,
when
he
was
not
in
bed
,
with
slow
,
dubious
steps
,
like
an
elderly
tourist
in
a
cathedral
.
His
energy
was
gone
.
He
was
able
,
now
,
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
chair
in
the
living
room
and
stare
out
at
the
bleak
yard
without
moving
.
His
hands
lay
loosely
,
yet
stiffly
--
they
were
like
wax
hands
:
almost
lifelike
,
not
quite
--
folded
in
his
lap
;
;
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
.
When
he
was
asked
a
question
or
addressed
in
such
a
way
that
some
response
was
inescapable
,
he
would
answer
;
;
if
,
as
often
happened
,
he
had
to
repeat
because
he
had
spoken
too
softly
,
he
would
repeat
his
words
in
the
same
way
,
without
emphasis
or
impatience
,
only
a
little
louder
.
He
had
not
mentioned
Kate
.
He
had
not
even
thought
about
her
much
except
once
or
twice
at
night
in
bed
when
his
slowly
ranging
thoughts
would
abruptly
,
almost
accidentally
,
encounter
her
.
At
these
times
he
felt
a
kind
of
pain
in
his
upper
chest
,
but
it
was
an
objective
pain
,
in
no
way
different
from
others
in
intensity
and
not
different
in
kind
;
;
it
was
like
the
bandaged
wound
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
occasionally
throbbed
;
;
it
was
merely
another
part
of
his
weakness
.
He
was
calm
,
drugged
,
and
lazy
.
He
did
not
care
.
Rachel
mentioned
Kate
.
She
said
,
``
I
notice
the
girl
from
across
the
street
hasn't
bothered
to
phone
or
visit
''
.
Scotty
said
,
``
That's
all
right
.
Kate's
all
right
''
.
He
thought
about
it
briefly
,
then
deliberately
turned
the
talk
to
something
else
.
Once
,
sitting
at
the
front
window
in
his
parents'
room
,
he
saw
Kate
come
out
of
her
house
.
She
was
with
Elizabeth
.
They
were
far
off
and
looked
tiny
.
The
heavy
branches
in
his
front
yard
would
hide
and
then
reveal
them
.
They
turned
at
the
bottom
of
Kate's
steps
and
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
park
.
He
thought
he
saw
--
it
awakened
and
,
for
a
moment
,
interested
him
--
that
Elizabeth
held
a
leash
in
her
hand
and
that
a
round
fuzzy
puppy
was
on
the
end
of
the
leash
.
Then
they
disappeared
and
Scotty
got
up
and
went
into
his
own
room
and
got
into
bed
.
By
the
time
he
was
under
the
covers
he
had
forgotten
about
seeing
Kate
.
The
doctor
,
since
Scotty
was
no
longer
allowed
to
make
his
regular
trips
into
town
to
see
him
,
came
often
and
informally
to
the
house
.
He
would
sit
,
slim-waisted
and
spare
,
on
the
edge
of
Scotty's
bed
,
his
legs
crossed
so
elaborately
that
the
crossed
foot
could
tap
the
floor
.
Scotty
did
not
mind
the
doctor's
unsmiling
teasing
as
he
used
to
.
``
Husky
young
man
''
,
he
said
with
mock
distaste
.
``
I
imagine
you're
always
battling
in
school
''
.
``
I
don't
go
to
school
any
more
''
.
``
Pardon
''
?
?
The
doctor
had
to
bend
close
to
hear
;
;
his
delicate
hand
,
as
veined
as
a
moth's
wing
,
rested
absently
on
Scotty's
chest
.
Scotty
said
the
same
words
more
loudly
.
``
Oh
.
Well
,
we're
taking
a
little
vacation
,
that's
all
''
.
He
turned
unsmilingly
to
Rachel
.
``
I
think
by
the
end
of
next
week
he
could
get
out
in
the
air
a
little
.
He
could
now
but
the
weakness
is
very
definite
;
;
it
would
exhaust
him
further
and
unnecessarily
.
He'll
be
stronger
soon
''
.
His
stethoscope
was
on
the
table
by
Scotty's
bed
and
he
picked
it
up
and
wagged
it
at
Scotty
.
He
said
fussily
,
``
Just
keep
the
cap
on
those
strong
emotions
''
.
The
stethoscope
glinted
silver
in
the
darkening
room
.
``
I'll
drop
by
again
in
a
few
days
''
.
Rachel
stayed
on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
.
She
smoothed
the
covers
on
Scotty's
bed
and
picked
things
up
from
the
floor
.
She
did
not
touch
him
.
Scotty
watched
with
disinterest
.
He
did
not
speak
.
He
had
no
desire
to
.
She
said
,
``
Do
you
think
you'll
miss
school
''
?
?
He
had
noticed
how
formal
and
irritably
exact
Rachel
had
grown
.
He
did
not
care
.
He
felt
her
irritability
did
not
concern
him
,
yet
he
knew
he
would
not
care
even
if
it
did
.
He
shook
his
head
.
``
We've
had
any
number
of
calls
about
you
.
You
could
win
a
popularity
contest
at
that
school
without
any
trouble
.
Miss
Estherson
called
twice
.
She
wants
to
pay
you
a
visit
.
She
says
the
children
miss
you
.
Apparently
you
were
the
light
of
their
lives
''
.
Scotty
shrugged
slightly
.
Rachel
came
close
to
the
bed
,
bent
as
if
she
would
kiss
him
,
then
moved
away
.
She
was
frowning
.
``
That
doctor
annoys
me
''
.
She
seemed
to
speak
to
herself
.
``
Do
you
suppose
his
self-consciousness
is
characteristic
of
the
new
Negro
professionals
or
merely
of
doctors
in
general
''
?
?
She
turned
to
him
again
.
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Charles
--
Sally
--
has
phoned
too
.
She
was
very
worried
''
.
Rachel's
tone
was
dry
.
``
She
didn't
really
say
''
--
She
glanced
away
at
the
floor
,
then
swooped
gracefully
and
picked
up
one
of
Scotty's
slippers
.
``
I
mean
,
do
you
feel
like
seeing
Kate
''
?
?
Scotty
said
,
``
I
don't
know
''
.
It
was
true
.
He
did
not
.
There
was
the
slight
pain
,
but
it
was
no
different
from
the
throbbing
in
his
head
.
``
Well
,
there's
time
,
in
any
case
.
We'll
wait
till
you're
stronger
and
then
talk
about
it
''
.
She
put
the
slipper
neatly
by
its
mate
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
Scotty
said
,
``
Okay
''
.
This
time
Rachel
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
.
Scotty
was
pleased
.
His
father
was
a
constant
visitor
.
Scotty
would
hear
the
front
door
in
the
evening
and
then
his
father's
deep
slow
voice
;
;
it
floated
up
the
stairs
.
``
How's
Scotty
''
?
?
And
Rachel's
or
Virginia's
reply
:
``
better
.
He's
getting
plenty
of
rest
''
.
``
Is
his
appetite
improved
''
?
?
Or
:
``
Does
he
get
exercise
''
?
?
The
exchange
was
almost
invariable
,
and
Scotty
,
in
his
bed
,
could
hear
every
word
of
it
.
He
never
smiled
.
It
required
an
energy
he
no
longer
possessed
to
be
satirical
about
his
father
.
His
father
would
come
upstairs
and
stand
self-consciously
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
look
at
his
son
.
After
a
pause
,
during
which
he
studied
Scotty's
face
as
if
Scotty
were
not
there
and
could
not
study
him
too
,
Mr.
McKinley
would
ask
the
same
questions
he
had
asked
downstairs
.
Scotty
would
reply
softly
and
his
father
,
apologetically
,
would
ask
him
to
repeat
.
``
I'm
eating
more
''
,
he
would
say
.
Or
:
``
I
walk
around
the
house
a
lot
''
.
``
Perhaps
you
should
get
out
a
little
''
.
``
I'm
not
supposed
to
yet
''
.
He
was
not
irritated
.
He
did
not
mind
the
useless
,
kindly
questions
.
He
looked
at
the
lined
face
with
vague
interest
;
;
he
felt
he
was
noting
it
,
as
if
it
were
something
he
might
think
about
when
he
grew
stronger
.
Mr.
McKinley
examined
everything
with
critical
care
,
seeking
something
material
to
blame
for
his
son's
illness
.
``
Have
you
got
enough
blankets
''
?
?
And
another
time
,
without
accusation
:
``
You
never
wore
that
scarf
I
bought
you
''
.
Where
their
sharp
edges
seemed
restless
as
sea
waves
thrusting
themselves
upward
in
angry
motion
,
Papa-san
sat
glacier-like
,
his
smooth
solidity
,
his
very
immobility
defying
all
the
turmoil
about
him
.
``
Our
objective
''
,
the
colonel
had
said
that
day
of
the
briefing
,
``
is
Papa-san
''
.
There
the
objective
sat
,
brooding
over
all
.
Gouge
,
burn
,
blast
,
insult
it
as
they
would
,
could
anyone
really
take
Papa-san
?
?
Between
the
ponderous
hulk
and
himself
,
in
the
valley
over
which
Papa-san
reigned
,
men
had
hidden
high
explosives
,
booby
traps
,
and
mines
.
The
raped
valley
was
a
pregnant
womb
awaiting
abortion
.
On
the
forward
slope
in
front
of
his
own
post
stretched
two
rows
of
barbed
wire
.
At
the
slope's
base
coils
of
concertina
stretched
out
of
eye
range
like
a
wild
tangle
of
children's
hoops
,
stopped
simultaneously
,
weirdly
poised
as
if
awaiting
the
magic
of
the
child's
touch
to
start
them
all
rolling
again
.
Closer
still
,
regular
barricades
of
barbed
wire
hung
on
timber
supports
.
Was
it
all
vain
labor
?
?
Who
would
clean
up
the
mess
when
the
war
was
over
?
?
Smiling
at
his
quixotic
thoughts
,
Warren
turned
back
from
the
opening
and
lit
a
cigarette
before
sitting
down
.
Tonight
a
group
of
men
,
tomorrow
night
he
himself
,
would
go
out
there
somewhere
and
wait
.
If
he
were
to
go
with
White
,
he
would
be
out
there
two
days
,
not
just
listening
in
the
dark
at
some
point
between
here
and
Papa-san
,
but
moving
ever
deeper
into
enemy
land
--
behind
Papa-san
--
itself
.
Was
this
what
he
had
expected
?
?
He
hadn't
realized
that
there
would
be
so
much
time
to
think
,
so
many
lulls
.
Somehow
he
had
forgotten
what
he
must
have
been
told
,
that
combat
was
an
intermittent
activity
.
Now
he
knew
that
the
moment
illuminated
by
the
vision
on
the
train
would
have
to
be
approached
.
It
could
take
place
tomorrow
night
,
or
it
might
occur
months
from
now
.
There
was
just
too
much
time
.
Time
to
become
afraid
.
White's
suggestion
flattered
,
but
he
did
not
like
the
identity
.
He
did
not
spill
over
with
hatred
for
the
enemy
.
He
hadn't
even
seen
him
yet
Pressing
his
cigarette
out
in
the
earth
,
Warren
walked
to
the
slit
and
scanned
the
jagged
hills
.
He
saw
no
life
,
but
still
stood
there
for
a
time
peering
at
the
unlovely
hills
,
his
gaze
continually
returning
to
Papa-san
.
He
had
come
here
in
order
to
test
himself
.
While
most
of
his
beliefs
were
still
unsettled
,
he
knew
that
he
did
not
believe
in
killing
.
Yet
,
he
was
here
.
He
had
come
because
he
could
not
live
out
his
life
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
coward
.
There
were
ten
men
on
the
patrol
which
Sergeant
Prevot
led
out
that
next
night
.
The
beaming
ROK
was
carrying
a
thirty-caliber
machine
gun
;
;
another
man
lugged
the
tripod
and
a
box
of
ammunition
.
Warren
and
White
each
carried
,
in
addition
to
their
own
weapons
and
ammo
,
a
box
of
ammo
for
the
ROK's
machine
gun
.
Others
carried
extra
clips
for
the
Browning
Automatic
Rifle
,
which
was
in
the
hands
of
a
little
Mexican
named
Martinez
.
Prevot
had
briefed
the
two
new
men
that
afternoon
.
``
We
just
sit
quiet
and
wait
''
,
Prevot
had
said
.
``
Be
sure
the
man
nearest
you
is
awake
.
If
Joe
doesn't
show
up
,
we'll
all
be
back
here
at
0600
hours
.
Otherwise
,
we
hold
a
reception
.
Then
we
pull
out
under
our
mortar
and
artillery
cover
,
but
nobody
pulls
out
until
I
say
so
.
Remember
what
I
said
about
going
out
to
get
anybody
left
behind
?
?
That
still
holds
.
We
bring
back
all
dead
and
wounded
''
.
At
2130
hours
they
had
passed
through
the
barbed
wire
at
the
point
of
departure
.
Then
began
the
journey
through
their
own
mine
fields
.
Mines
.
Ours
were
kinder
than
theirs
,
some
said
.
They
set
bouncing
betties
to
jump
and
explode
at
testicle
level
while
we
more
mercifully
had
them
go
off
at
the
head
.
Mines
.
Big
ones
and
little
.
The
crude
wooden
boxes
of
the
enemy
,
our
nicely
turned
gray
metal
disks
.
But
theirs
defied
the
detectors
.
Mines
.
A
foot
misplaced
,
a
leg
missing
.
Mines
.
All
sizes
:
big
ones
,
some
wired
to
set
off
a
whole
field
,
little
ones
,
hand
grenade
size
.
Booby
traps
to
fill
the
head
with
chunks
of
metal
.
Warren
tried
to
shake
off
the
jumble
of
his
fears
by
looking
at
the
sky
.
It
was
dark
.
Prevot
had
said
that
the
searchlights
would
be
bounced
off
the
clouds
at
2230
hours
,
``
which
gives
us
time
to
get
settled
in
position
''
.
Because
they
were
new
men
and
to
be
sure
that
they
didn't
get
lost
,
Prevot
had
placed
Warren
and
White
in
the
center
of
the
patrol
as
it
filed
out
.
His
eyes
now
fixed
on
White's
solid
figure
,
Warren
could
hear
behind
him
the
tread
of
another
.
He
could
also
hear
the
stream
which
he
had
seen
from
his
position
.
They
were
going
to
follow
it
for
part
of
their
journey
.
``
It's
safe
''
,
Prevot
had
said
,
``
and
it
provides
cover
for
our
noise
''
.
Soon
they
were
picking
their
way
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
which
glowed
in
the
night
.
On
their
right
rose
the
embankment
covered
with
brush
and
trees
.
If
a
branch
extended
out
too
far
,
each
man
held
it
back
for
the
next
,
and
if
they
met
a
low
overhang
,
each
warned
the
other
.
Thus
,
stealthily
they
advanced
upstream
;
;
then
they
turned
to
the
right
,
climbed
the
embankment
,
and
walked
into
the
valley
again
.
There
was
no
cover
here
,
only
grass
sighing
against
pant-legs
.
And
with
each
sigh
,
like
a
whip
in
the
hand
of
an
expert
,
the
grass
stripped
something
from
Warren
.
The
gentle
whir
of
each
footstep
left
him
more
naked
than
before
,
until
he
felt
his
unprotected
flesh
tremble
,
chilled
by
each
new
sound
.
The
shapes
of
the
men
ahead
of
him
lacked
solidity
,
as
if
the
whip
had
stripped
them
of
their
very
flesh
.
The
dark
forms
moved
like
mourners
on
some
nocturnal
pilgrimage
,
their
dirge
unsung
for
want
of
vocal
chords
.
The
warped
,
broken
trees
in
the
valley
assumed
wraith-like
shapes
.
Clumps
of
brush
that
they
passed
were
so
many
enchained
demons
straining
in
anger
to
tear
and
gnaw
on
his
bones
.
Looming
over
all
,
Papa-san
leered
down
at
him
,
threatening
a
hundred
hidden
malevolencies
.
Off
in
the
distance
a
searchlight
flashed
on
,
its
beam
slashing
the
sky
.
The
sharp
ray
was
absorbed
by
a
cloud
,
then
reflected
to
the
earth
in
a
softer
,
diffused
radiance
.
Somewhere
over
there
another
patrol
had
need
of
light
.
Warren
thought
of
all
the
men
out
that
night
who
,
like
himself
,
had
left
their
protective
ridge
and
--
fear
working
at
their
guts
--
picked
their
way
into
the
area
beyond
.
From
the
east
to
the
west
coast
of
the
Korean
peninsula
was
a
strip
of
land
in
which
fear-filled
men
were
at
that
same
moment
furtively
crawling
through
the
night
,
sitting
in
sweaty
anticipation
of
any
movement
or
sound
,
or
shouting
amidst
confused
rifle
flashes
and
muzzle
blasts
.
White's
arm
went
up
and
Warren
raised
his
own
.
The
patrol
was
stopping
.
Prevot
came
up
``
.
Take
that
spot
over
there
''
,
he
whispered
,
pointing
to
a
small
clump
of
blackness
.
``
Give
me
your
machine
gun
ammo
''
.
Warren
handed
him
the
metal
box
and
Prevot
quietly
disappeared
down
the
line
.
Lying
in
the
grass
behind
the
brush
clump
,
Warren
looked
about
.
The
others
likewise
had
hidden
themselves
in
the
grass
and
the
brush
.
Over
his
shoulder
he
could
see
Prevot
with
the
machine
gun
crew
.
Even
at
this
short
distance
they
were
only
vague
shapes
,
setting
up
the
machine
gun
on
a
small
knoll
so
that
it
could
fire
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
patrol
.
Warren
eased
his
rifle's
safety
off
and
gently
,
slowly
sneaked
another
clip
of
ammunition
from
one
of
the
cloth
bandoleers
that
marked
the
upper
part
of
his
body
with
an
Aj
.
This
he
placed
within
quick
reach
.
The
walk
and
his
fears
had
served
to
overheat
him
and
his
sweaty
armpits
cooled
at
the
touch
of
the
night
air
.
Although
the
armored
vest
fitted
the
upper
part
of
his
body
snugly
,
he
felt
no
security
.
Figures
seemed
to
crouch
in
the
surrounding
dark
;
;
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
band
of
men
who
seemed
to
advance
and
retreat
even
as
he
watched
.
Certain
this
menace
was
only
imaginary
,
he
yet
stared
in
fascinated
horror
,
his
hand
sticky
against
the
stock
of
his
weapon
.
He
was
aware
of
insistent
inner
beatings
,
as
if
prisoners
within
sought
release
from
his
rigid
body
.
Above
,
the
glowing
ivory
baton
of
their
searchlight
pointed
at
the
clouds
,
diluting
the
valley's
dark
to
a
pallid
light
.
Then
the
figures
which
held
his
attention
became
a
group
of
shattered
trees
,
standing
like
the
grotesques
of
a
medieval
damnation
scene
.
Even
so
,
he
could
not
ease
the
tension
of
his
body
;
;
the
rough
surface
of
the
earth
itself
seemed
to
resist
every
attempt
on
his
part
to
relax
.
Sensing
the
unseen
presence
of
the
other
men
in
the
patrol
,
he
felt
mutely
united
to
these
nine
near-strangers
sharing
this
pinpoint
of
being
with
him
.
He
sensed
something
precious
in
the
perilous
moment
,
something
akin
to
the
knowledge
gained
on
his
bicycle
trip
through
the
French
countryside
,
a
knowledge
imprisoned
in
speechlessness
.
--
In
France
he
had
puzzled
the
meaning
of
the
great
stone
monuments
men
had
thrown
up
to
the
sky
,
and
always
as
he
wandered
,
he
felt
a
stranger
to
their
exultation
.
They
were
poems
in
a
strange
language
,
of
which
he
could
barely
touch
a
meaning
--
enough
to
make
his
being
ache
with
the
desire
for
the
fullness
he
sensed
there
.
Brittany
,
that
stone-gray
mystery
through
which
he
traveled
for
thirty
days
,
sleeping
in
the
barns
of
farmers
or
alongside
roads
,
had
worked
some
subtle
change
in
him
,
he
knew
,
and
it
was
in
Brittany
that
he
had
met
Pierre
.
Pierre
had
no
hands
;
;
they
had
been
severed
at
the
wrists
.
With
leather
cups
fitted
in
his
handlebars
,
he
steered
his
bicycle
.
He
and
Warren
had
traveled
together
for
four
days
.
They
visited
the
shipyards
at
Brest
and
Pierre
had
to
sign
the
register
,
vouching
for
the
integrity
of
the
visiting
foreigner
.
He
took
the
pen
in
his
stumps
and
began
to
write
.
``
Wait
!
!
Wait
''
!
!
Cried
the
guard
who
ran
from
the
hut
to
shout
to
other
men
standing
about
outside
.
They
crowded
the
small
room
and
peered
over
one
another's
shoulders
to
watch
the
handless
man
write
his
name
in
the
book
.
``
C'est
formidable
''
,
they
exclaimed
.
``
Mais
,
oui
.
C'est
merveilleux
''
.
And
then
the
questions
came
,
eager
,
interested
questions
,
and
many
compliments
on
his
having
overcome
his
infirmity
.
``
Doesn't
it
ever
bother
you
''
,
Warren
had
asked
,
``
to
have
people
always
asking
you
about
your
hands
''
?
?
``
Oh
,
the
French
are
a
very
curious
people
''
,
Pierre
had
laughed
.
``
They
are
also
honest
seekers
after
truth
.
Now
the
English
are
painfully
silent
about
my
missing
hands
.
They
refuse
to
mention
or
to
notice
that
they
are
not
there
.
The
Americans
,
like
yourself
,
take
the
fact
for
granted
,
try
to
be
helpful
,
but
don't
ask
questions
.
I'm
used
to
all
three
,
but
I
think
the
French
have
the
healthiest
attitude
''
.
That
was
the
day
that
Pierre
had
told
Warren
about
the
Abbey
of
Solesmes
.
``
You
are
looking
tired
and
there
you
can
rest
.
It
will
be
good
for
you
.
I
think
,
too
''
,
he
said
,
his
dark
eyes
mischievous
,
``
that
you
will
find
there
some
clue
to
the
secret
of
the
cathedrals
about
which
you
have
spoken
''
.
Within
two
weeks
Warren
was
ringing
the
bell
at
the
abbey
gate
.
The
monk
who
opened
the
door
immediately
calmed
his
worries
about
his
reception
:
``
I
speak
English
''
,
the
old
man
said
,
``
but
I
do
not
hear
it
very
well
''
.
He
smiled
and
stuck
a
large
finger
with
white
hairs
sprouting
on
it
into
his
ear
as
though
that
might
help
.
Smiling
at
Warren's
protestations
,
the
old
monk
took
his
grip
from
him
and
led
him
down
a
corridor
to
a
small
parlor
.
``
Will
you
please
wait
in
here
.
Mickie
sat
over
his
second
whisky-on-the-rocks
in
a
little
bar
next
to
the
funeral
parlor
on
Pennsylvania
Avenue
.
Al's
Little
Cafe
was
small
,
dark
,
narrow
,
and
filled
with
the
mingled
scent
of
beer
,
tobacco
smoke
,
and
Italian
cooking
.
Hanging
over
the
bar
was
an
oil
painting
of
a
nude
Al
had
accepted
from
a
student
at
the
Corcoran
Gallery
who
needed
to
eat
and
drink
and
was
broke
.
The
nude
was
small
and
black-haired
and
elfin
,
and
was
called
``
Eloise
''
.
This
was
one
place
where
Moonan
could
go
for
a
drink
in
a
back
booth
without
anyone
noticing
him
,
or
at
least
coming
up
and
hanging
around
and
wanting
to
know
all
the
low-down
.
The
other
patrons
were
taxi
drivers
and
art
students
and
small
shopkeepers
.
The
reporters
had
not
yet
discovered
that
this
was
his
hideaway
.
His
friend
Jane
was
with
him
.
She
was
wise
enough
to
realize
a
man
could
be
good
company
even
if
he
did
weigh
too
much
and
didn't
own
the
mint
.
She
was
the
widow
of
a
writer
who
had
died
in
an
airplane
crash
,
and
Mickie
had
found
her
a
job
as
head
of
the
historical
section
of
the
Treasury
.
This
meant
sorting
out
press
clippings
and
the
like
.
Jane
sat
receptive
and
interested
.
Mickie
had
a
pleasant
glow
as
he
said
,
``
You
see
,
both
of
them
,
I
mean
the
President
and
Jeff
Lawrence
,
are
romantics
.
A
romantic
is
one
who
thinks
the
world
is
divinely
inspired
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
find
the
right
key
,
and
then
divine
justice
and
altruism
will
appear
.
It's
like
focusing
a
camera
;
;
the
distant
ship
isn't
there
until
you
get
the
focus
.
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about
.
I'm
sure
all
girls
feel
this
way
about
men
until
they
live
with
them
.
``
But
when
it
comes
to
war
,
the
Colonel
knows
what
it
is
and
Jeff
doesn't
.
Mr.
Christiansen
knows
that
a
soldier
will
get
the
Distinguished
Service
Medal
for
conduct
that
would
land
him
in
prison
for
life
or
the
electric
chair
as
a
civilian
.
He
had
a
mean
,
unbroken
sheer
bastard
in
his
outfit
,
and
someone
invented
the
name
Trig
for
him
.
That's
to
say
,
he
was
trigger
happy
.
He'd
shoot
at
anything
if
it
was
the
rear
end
of
a
horse
or
his
own
sentry
.
He
was
a
wiry
,
inscrutable
,
silent
country
boy
from
the
red
clay
of
rural
Alabama
,
and
he
spoke
with
the
broad
drawl
that
others
normally
make
fun
of
.
But
not
in
front
of
Trig
.
I
heard
of
some
that
tried
it
back
in
the
States
,
and
he'd
knock
them
clear
across
the
room
.
There'd
been
a
pretty
bad
incident
back
at
the
Marine
base
.
A
New
York
kid
,
a
refugee
from
one
of
the
Harlem
gangs
,
made
fun
of
Trig's
accent
,
and
drew
a
knife
.
Before
the
fight
was
over
,
the
Harlem
boy
had
a
concussion
and
Trig
was
cut
up
badly
.
They
caught
Trig
stealing
liquor
from
the
officers'
mess
,
and
he
got
a
couple
of
girls
in
trouble
.
The
fear
of
punishment
just
didn't
bother
him
.
It
wasn't
there
.
It
was
left
out
of
him
at
birth
.
This
is
why
he
made
such
a
magnificent
soldier
.
He
wasn't
troubled
with
the
ordinary
,
rank-and-file
fear
that
overcomes
and
paralyzes
and
sends
individual
soldiers
and
whole
companies
under
fire
running
in
panic
.
It
just
didn't
occur
to
Trig
that
anything
serious
would
happen
to
him
.
Do
you
get
the
picture
of
the
kind
of
fellow
he
was
''
?
?
Jane
nodded
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
``
All
right
.
There
was
a
sniper's
nest
in
a
mountain
cave
,
and
it
was
picking
off
our
men
with
devilish
accuracy
.
The
Colonel
ordered
that
it
be
wiped
out
,
and
I
suggested
,
'
You
ask
for
volunteers
,
and
promise
each
man
on
the
patrol
a
quart
of
whisky
,
ten
dollars
and
a
week-end
pass
to
Davao
.
Trig
was
one
of
the
five
volunteers
.
The
patrol
snaked
around
in
back
of
the
cave
,
approached
it
from
above
and
dropped
in
suddenly
with
wild
howls
.
You
could
hear
them
from
our
outpost
.
There
was
a
lot
of
shooting
.
We
knew
the
enemy
was
subdued
,
because
a
flare
was
fired
as
the
signal
.
So
we
hurried
over
.
Two
of
our
men
were
killed
,
a
third
was
wounded
.
Trig
and
a
very
black
colored
boy
from
Detroit
had
killed
or
put
out
of
action
ten
guerrillas
by
grenades
and
hand-to-hand
fighting
.
When
we
got
there
,
Trig
and
the
Negro
were
quarreling
over
possession
of
a
gold
crucifix
around
the
neck
of
a
wounded
Filipino
.
The
colored
boy
had
it
,
and
Trig
lunged
at
him
with
a
knife
and
said
,
'
Give
that
to
me
,
you
black
bastard
.
We
don't
'low
nigras
to
walk
on
the
same
sidewalk
with
white
men
where
I
come
from
.
``
The
Negro
got
a
bad
slice
on
his
chest
from
the
knife
wound
''
.
``
What
did
the
Colonel
do
about
the
men
''
?
?
Jane
asked
in
her
placid
,
interested
way
.
Mickie
laughed
.
``
He
recommended
both
of
them
for
the
DSM
and
the
Detroit
fellow
for
the
Purple
Heart
,
too
,
for
a
combat-inflicted
wound
.
So
you
see
Mr.
Christiansen
knows
what
it's
all
about
.
But
not
Jeff
Lawrence
.
When
he
was
in
the
war
,
he
was
in
Law
or
Supplies
or
something
like
that
,
and
an
old
buddy
of
his
told
me
he
would
come
down
on
Sundays
to
the
Pentagon
and
read
the
citations
for
medals
--
just
like
the
one
we
sent
in
for
Trig
--
and
go
away
with
a
real
glow
.
These
were
heroes
nine
feet
tall
to
him
''
.
Jefferson
Lawrence
was
alone
at
the
small
,
perfectly
appointed
table
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
river
.
He
had
dinner
and
sat
there
over
his
coffee
watching
the
winding
pattern
of
traffic
as
it
crossed
the
bridge
and
spread
out
like
a
serpent
with
two
heads
.
Beside
him
was
Mrs.
Dalloway
.
He
thought
how
this
dainty
,
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
Westminster
on
a
day
in
June
,
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
,
the
greetings
from
old
friends
,
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
,
passionate
breath
,
was
so
like
himself
.
He
,
and
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
too
,
had
never
permitted
themselves
the
luxury
of
joys
that
dug
into
the
bone
marrow
of
the
spirit
.
He
had
not
because
he
was
both
poor
and
ambitious
.
Poverty
imposes
a
kind
of
chastity
on
the
ambitious
.
They
cannot
stop
to
grasp
and
embrace
and
sit
in
the
back
seat
of
cars
along
a
dark
country
lane
.
No
,
they
must
look
the
other
way
and
climb
one
more
painful
step
up
the
ladder
.
He
made
the
decision
with
his
eyes
open
,
or
so
he
thought
.
At
any
cost
,
he
must
leave
the
dreary
Pennsylvania
mining
town
where
his
father
was
a
pharmacist
.
And
so
he
had
,
so
he
had
.
At
State
College
,
he
had
no
time
to
walk
among
the
violets
on
the
water's
edge
.
From
his
room
he
could
look
out
in
springtime
and
see
the
couples
hand
in
hand
walking
slowly
,
deliciously
,
across
the
campus
,
and
he
could
smell
the
sweet
vernal
winds
.
He
was
not
stone
.
He
was
not
unmoved
.
He
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
.
He
must
mentally
pull
the
blinds
and
close
the
window
,
so
that
all
that
existed
was
in
the
books
before
him
.
At
law
school
,
the
same
.
More
of
this
stamping
down
of
human
emotion
as
a
young
lawyer
in
New
York
.
By
the
time
he
was
prosperous
enough
--
his
goals
were
high
--
he
was
bald
and
afraid
of
women
.
The
only
one
who
would
have
him
was
his
cripple
,
the
strange
unhappy
woman
who
became
his
wife
.
Perhaps
it
was
right
;
;
perhaps
it
was
just
.
He
had
dared
to
defy
nature
,
to
turn
his
back
to
the
Lorelei
,
and
he
was
punished
.
Like
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
with
her
regrets
about
Peter
Walsh
,
he
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
over
a
youth
too
well
spent
.
If
he
had
had
a
son
,
he
would
tell
him
,
``
Gather
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
This
same
flower
that
smiles
today
tomorrow
will
be
dying
''
.
But
then
his
son
could
afford
it
.
Lawrence
was
waiting
for
Bill
Boxell
.
The
Vice
President
had
called
and
asked
if
he
could
see
the
Secretary
at
his
home
.
He
said
the
matter
was
urgent
.
The
Secretary
was
uneasy
about
the
visit
.
He
did
not
like
Boxell
.
He
suspected
something
underhanded
and
furtive
about
him
.
Lawrence
could
not
put
his
finger
on
it
precisely
,
and
this
worried
him
.
When
you
disliked
or
distrusted
a
man
,
you
should
have
a
reason
.
Human
nature
was
not
a
piece
of
meat
you
could
tell
was
bad
by
its
smell
.
Lawrence
stared
a
minute
at
the
lighted
ribbon
of
traffic
,
hoping
that
a
clue
to
his
dislike
of
the
Vice
President
would
appear
.
It
did
not
.
Therefore
,
he
decided
he
was
unfair
to
the
young
man
and
should
make
an
effort
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
his
point
of
view
.
A
half
hour
later
the
Vice
President
arrived
.
He
looked
very
carefully
at
every
piece
of
furnishing
,
as
though
hoping
to
store
this
information
carefully
in
his
mind
.
He
observed
the
Florentine
vase
in
the
hall
,
the
Renoir
painting
in
the
library
,
as
well
as
the
long
shelves
of
well-bound
volumes
;
;
the
pattern
of
the
Oriental
rug
,
the
delicate
cut-glass
chandelier
.
He
said
to
the
Secretary
,
``
I
understand
you
came
from
a
little
Pennsylvania
town
near
Wilkes-Barre
.
How
did
you
find
out
about
this
''
?
?
He
waved
his
arm
around
at
the
furnishings
.
It
was
not
a
discourteous
question
,
Lawrence
decided
.
This
young
man
had
so
little
time
to
learn
he
had
to
be
curious
;
;
he
had
to
find
out
.
The
Secretary
did
not
tell
him
at
what
cost
,
at
what
loneliness
,
he
learned
these
things
.
He
merely
said
,
``
Any
good
decorator
these
days
can
make
you
a
tasteful
home
''
.
The
Vice
President
said
,
``
If
you
hear
of
any
names
that
would
fix
me
cheap
in
return
for
advertising
they
decorated
the
Vice
President's
home
,
let
me
know
.
I
can
do
business
with
that
kind
''
.
Again
,
Lawrence
thought
a
little
sadly
,
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
.
Boxell
did
not
have
the
chance
to
grow
up
graciously
.
He
had
to
acquire
everything
he
was
going
to
get
in
four
years
.
They
had
brandy
in
the
library
.
Boxell
looked
at
Lawrence
with
a
searching
glance
,
the
kind
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
would
give
a
man
on
trial
.
What
are
your
weaknesses
?
?
Where
will
you
break
?
?
How
best
to
destroy
your
peace
?
?
The
Vice
President
said
with
a
slight
bluster
,
``
There
isn't
anyone
who
loves
the
President
more
than
I
do
.
Old
Chris
is
my
ideal
.
At
the
same
time
,
you
have
to
face
facts
and
realize
that
a
man
who's
been
in
the
Marine
Corps
all
his
life
doesn't
understand
much
about
politics
.
What
does
a
monk
know
about
sex
''
?
?
Lawrence
listened
with
the
practiced
,
deceptive
calm
of
the
lawyer
,
but
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
.
``
So
,
we
have
to
protect
the
old
man
for
his
own
good
.
You
see
what
I
mean
.
Congress
is
full
of
politicians
,
and
if
you
want
to
get
along
with
them
,
you
have
to
be
politic
.
This
is
why
I
say
we
just
can't
go
ahead
and
disarm
the
Germans
and
pull
down
our
own
defenses
.
Let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
today
.
A
fellow
came
up
to
me
,
a
Senator
,
I
don't
have
to
tell
you
his
name
,
and
he
told
me
,
'
I
love
the
President
like
a
brother
,
but
God
damn
it
,
he's
crucifying
me
.
I've
got
a
quarter
of
a
million
Germans
in
my
state
,
and
those
krautheads
tune
in
on
Father
Werther
every
night
,
and
if
he
tells
them
to
go
out
and
piss
in
the
public
square
,
that's
what
they
do
.
He's
telling
them
now
to
write
letters
to
their
Congressmen
opposing
the
disarmament
of
Germany
.
And
another
one
comes
to
me
and
he
says
,
'
Look
here
,
there's
a
mill
in
my
state
employs
five
thousand
people
making
uniforms
for
the
Navy
.
The
Bishop
looked
at
him
coldly
and
said
,
``
Take
it
or
leave
it
''
!
!
Literally
,
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
.
He
was
caught
in
a
machine
.
But
Sojourner
was
not
easily
excited
or
upset
and
said
quite
calmly
:
``
Let's
go
and
see
what
it's
like
''
.
Annisberg
was
about
seventy-five
miles
west
of
Birmingham
,
near
the
Georgia
border
and
on
the
Tallahoosa
River
,
a
small
and
dirty
stream
.
The
city
was
a
center
of
manufacture
,
especially
in
textiles
,
and
also
because
of
the
beauty
of
some
of
its
surroundings
,
a
residence
for
many
owners
of
the
great
industries
in
north
Alabama
.
But
it
had
,
as
was
usual
in
southern
cities
of
this
sort
,
a
Black
Bottom
,
a
low
region
near
the
river
where
the
Negroes
lived
--
servants
and
laborers
huddled
together
in
a
region
with
no
sewage
save
the
river
,
where
streets
and
sidewalks
were
neglected
and
where
there
was
much
poverty
and
crime
.
Wilson
came
by
train
from
Birmingham
and
looked
the
city
over
;
;
the
rather
pleasant
white
city
was
on
the
hill
where
the
chief
stores
were
.
Beyond
were
industries
and
factories
.
Then
they
went
down
to
Black
Bottom
.
In
the
midst
of
this
crowded
region
was
the
Allen
African
Methodist
Episcopal
Church
.
It
was
an
old
and
dirty
wooden
structure
,
sadly
in
need
of
repair
.
But
it
was
a
landmark
.
It
had
been
there
50
years
or
more
and
everybody
in
town
,
black
and
white
,
knew
of
it
.
It
had
just
suffered
a
calamity
,
the
final
crisis
in
a
long
series
of
calamities
.
For
the
old
preacher
who
had
been
there
twenty-five
years
was
dead
,
and
the
city
mourned
him
.
He
was
a
loud-voiced
man
,
once
vigorous
but
for
many
years
now
declining
in
strength
and
ability
.
He
was
stern
and
overbearing
with
his
flock
,
but
obsequious
and
conciliatory
with
the
whites
,
especially
the
rich
who
partly
supported
the
church
.
The
Deacon
Board
,
headed
by
a
black
man
named
Carlson
,
had
practically
taken
over
as
the
pastor
grew
old
,
and
had
its
way
with
the
support
of
the
Amen
corner
.
The
characteristic
thing
about
this
church
was
its
Amen
corner
and
the
weekly
religious
orgy
.
A
knot
of
old
worshippers
,
chiefly
women
,
listened
weekly
to
a
sermon
.
It
began
invariably
in
low
tones
,
almost
conversational
,
and
then
gradually
worked
up
to
high
,
shrill
appeals
to
God
and
man
.
And
then
the
Amen
corner
took
hold
,
re-enacting
a
form
of
group
participation
in
worship
that
stemmed
from
years
before
the
Greek
chorus
,
spreading
down
through
the
African
forest
,
overseas
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
then
here
in
Alabama
.
With
shout
and
slow
dance
,
with
tears
and
song
,
with
scream
and
contortion
,
the
corner
group
was
beset
by
hysteria
and
shivering
,
wailing
,
shouting
,
possession
of
something
that
seemed
like
an
alien
and
outside
force
.
It
spread
to
most
of
the
audience
and
was
often
viewed
by
visiting
whites
who
snickered
behind
handkerchief
and
afterward
discussed
Negro
religion
.
It
sometimes
ended
in
death-like
trances
with
many
lying
exhausted
and
panting
on
chair
and
floor
.
To
most
of
those
who
composed
the
Amen
corner
it
was
a
magnificent
and
beautiful
experience
,
something
for
which
they
lived
from
week
to
week
.
It
was
often
re-enacted
in
less
wild
form
at
the
Wednesday
night
prayer
meeting
.
Wilson
,
on
his
first
Sunday
,
witnessed
this
with
something
like
disgust
.
He
had
preached
a
short
sermon
,
trying
to
talk
man-to-man
to
the
audience
,
to
tell
them
who
he
was
,
what
he
had
done
in
Macon
and
Birmingham
,
and
what
he
proposed
to
do
here
.
He
sympathized
with
them
on
the
loss
of
their
old
pastor
.
But
then
,
at
mention
of
that
name
,
the
Amen
corner
broke
loose
.
He
had
no
chance
to
say
another
word
.
At
the
very
end
,
when
the
audience
was
silent
and
breathless
,
a
collection
was
taken
and
then
slowly
everyone
filed
out
.
The
audience
did
not
think
much
of
the
new
pastor
,
and
what
the
new
pastor
thought
of
the
audience
he
did
not
dare
at
the
time
to
say
.
During
the
next
weeks
he
looked
over
the
situation
.
First
of
all
there
was
the
parsonage
,
an
utterly
impossible
place
for
civilized
people
to
live
in
,
originally
poorly
conceived
,
apparently
not
repaired
for
years
,
with
no
plumbing
or
sewage
,
with
rat-holes
and
rot
.
It
was
arranged
that
he
would
board
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
old
members
of
the
church
,
a
woman
named
Catt
who
,
as
Wilson
afterward
found
,
was
briefly
referred
to
as
The
Cat
because
of
her
sharp
tongue
and
fierce
initiative
.
Ann
Catt
was
a
lonely
,
devoted
soul
,
never
married
,
conducting
a
spotless
home
and
devoted
to
her
church
,
but
a
perpetual
dissenter
and
born
critic
.
She
soared
over
the
new
pastor
like
an
avenging
angel
lest
he
stray
from
the
path
and
not
know
all
the
truth
and
gossip
of
which
she
was
chief
repository
.
Then
Wilson
looked
over
the
church
and
studied
its
condition
.
The
salary
of
the
pastor
had
for
years
been
$500
annually
and
even
this
was
in
arrears
.
Wilson
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
receive
at
least
$2,500
,
but
when
he
mentioned
this
to
the
Deacons
they
said
nothing
.
The
church
itself
must
be
repaired
.
It
was
dirty
and
neglected
.
It
really
ought
to
be
rebuilt
,
and
he
determined
to
go
up
and
talk
to
the
city
banks
about
this
.
Meanwhile
,
the
city
itself
should
be
talked
to
.
The
streets
in
the
colored
section
were
dirty
.
There
was
typhoid
and
malaria
.
The
children
had
nowhere
to
go
and
no
place
to
play
,
not
even
sidewalks
.
The
school
was
small
,
dark
and
ill-equipped
.
The
teacher
was
a
pliant
fool
.
There
were
two
liquor
saloons
not
very
far
from
the
church
,
one
white
,
that
is
conducted
for
white
people
with
a
side
entrance
for
Negroes
;
;
the
other
exclusively
Negro
.
Undoubtedly
,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gambling
in
both
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
church
was
a
quiet
,
well-kept
house
with
shutters
and
recently
painted
.
Wilson
inquired
about
it
.
It
was
called
Kent
House
.
The
deacon
of
the
church
,
Carlson
,
was
its
janitor
.
One
of
the
leading
members
of
the
Amen
corner
was
cook
;
;
there
were
two
or
three
colored
maids
employed
there
.
Wilson
was
told
that
it
was
a
sort
of
hotel
for
white
people
,
which
seemed
to
him
rather
queer
.
Why
should
a
white
hotel
be
set
down
in
the
center
of
Black
Bottom
?
?
But
nevertheless
it
looked
respectable
.
He
was
glad
to
have
it
there
.
The
rest
of
Black
Bottom
was
a
rabbit
warren
of
homes
in
every
condition
of
neglect
,
disrepair
and
careful
upkeep
.
Dives
,
carefully
repaired
huts
,
and
nicely
painted
and
ornamented
cottages
were
jumbled
together
cheek
by
jowl
with
little
distinction
.
The
best
could
not
escape
from
the
worst
and
the
worst
nestled
cosily
beside
the
better
.
The
yards
,
front
and
back
,
were
narrow
;
;
some
were
trash
dumps
,
some
had
flower
gardens
.
Behind
were
privies
,
for
there
was
no
sewage
system
.
After
looking
about
a
bit
,
Wilson
discovered
beyond
Black
Bottom
,
across
the
river
and
far
removed
from
the
white
city
,
a
considerable
tract
of
land
,
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
church
and
the
better
Negro
homes
might
gradually
be
moved
to
this
plot
.
He
talked
about
it
to
the
Presiding
Elder
.
The
Presiding
Elder
looked
him
over
rather
carefully
.
He
was
not
sure
what
kind
of
a
man
he
had
in
hand
.
But
there
was
one
thing
that
he
had
to
stress
,
and
that
was
that
the
contribution
to
the
general
church
expenses
,
the
dollar
money
,
had
been
seriously
falling
behind
in
this
church
,
and
that
must
be
looked
after
immediately
.
In
fact
,
he
intimated
clearly
that
that
was
the
reason
that
Wilson
had
been
sent
here
--
to
make
a
larger
contribution
of
dollar
money
.
Wilson
stressed
the
fact
that
clear
as
this
was
,
they
must
have
a
better
church
,
a
more
business-like
conduct
of
the
church
organization
,
and
an
effort
to
get
this
religious
center
out
of
its
rut
of
wild
worship
into
a
modern
church
organization
.
He
emphasized
to
the
Presiding
Elder
the
plan
of
giving
up
the
old
church
and
moving
across
the
river
.
The
Presiding
Elder
was
sure
that
that
would
be
impossible
.
But
he
told
Wilson
to
``
go
ahead
and
try
''
.
And
Wilson
tried
.
It
did
seem
impossible
.
The
bank
which
held
the
mortgage
on
the
old
church
declared
that
the
interest
was
considerably
in
arrears
,
and
the
real
estate
people
said
flatly
that
the
land
across
the
river
was
being
held
for
an
eventual
development
for
white
working
people
who
were
coming
in
,
and
that
none
would
be
sold
to
colored
folk
.
When
it
was
proposed
to
rebuild
the
church
,
Wilson
found
that
the
terms
for
a
new
mortgage
were
very
high
.
He
was
sure
that
he
could
do
better
if
he
went
to
Atlanta
to
get
the
deal
financed
.
But
when
this
proposal
was
made
to
his
Deacon
Board
,
he
met
unanimous
opposition
.
The
church
certainly
would
not
be
removed
.
The
very
proposition
was
sacrilege
.
It
had
been
here
fifty
years
.
It
was
going
to
stay
forever
.
It
was
hardly
possible
to
get
any
argument
on
the
subject
.
As
for
rebuilding
,
well
,
that
might
be
looked
into
,
but
there
was
no
hurry
,
no
hurry
at
all
.
Wilson
again
went
downtown
to
a
different
banker
,
an
intelligent
young
white
man
who
seemed
rather
sympathetic
,
but
he
shook
his
head
.
``
Reverend
''
,
he
said
,
``
I
think
you
don't
quite
understand
the
situation
here
.
Don't
you
see
the
amount
of
money
that
has
been
invested
by
whites
around
that
church
?
?
Tenements
,
stores
,
saloons
,
some
gambling
,
I
hope
not
too
much
.
The
colored
people
are
getting
employment
at
Kent
House
and
other
places
,
and
they
are
near
their
places
of
employment
.
When
a
city
has
arranged
things
like
this
you
cannot
easily
change
them
.
Now
,
if
I
were
you
I
would
just
plan
to
repair
the
old
church
so
it
would
last
for
five
or
ten
years
.
By
that
time
,
perhaps
something
better
can
be
done
''
.
Then
Wilson
asked
,
``
What
about
this
Kent
House
which
you
mention
?
?
I
don't
understand
why
a
white
hotel
should
be
down
here
''
.
The
young
banker
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
surprise
,
and
then
he
said
flatly
:
``
I'm
afraid
I
can't
tell
you
anything
in
particular
about
Kent
House
.
You'll
have
to
find
out
about
it
on
your
own
.
Hope
to
see
you
again
''
.
And
he
dismissed
the
colored
pastor
.
It
was
next
day
that
Sojourner
came
and
sat
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
.
She
said
,
``
My
dear
,
do
you
know
what
Kent
House
is
''
?
?
``
No
''
,
said
Wilson
,
``
I
don't
.
I
was
just
asking
about
it
.
What
is
it
''
?
?
``
It's
a
house
of
prostitution
for
white
men
with
white
girls
as
inmates
.
They
hire
a
good
deal
of
local
labor
,
including
two
members
of
our
Trustee
Board
.
They
buy
some
supplies
from
our
colored
grocers
and
they
are
patronized
by
some
of
the
best
white
gentlemen
in
town
''
.
Wilson
stared
at
her
.
``
My
dear
,
you
must
be
mistaken
''
.
``
Talk
to
Mrs.
Catt
''
,
she
said
.
And
after
Wilson
had
talked
to
Mrs.
Catt
and
to
others
,
he
was
absolutely
amazed
.
This
,
of
course
,
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
used
to
take
place
in
Southern
cities
--
putting
white
houses
of
prostitution
with
colored
girls
in
colored
neighborhoods
and
carrying
them
on
openly
.
But
it
had
largely
disappeared
on
account
of
protest
by
the
whites
and
through
growing
resentment
on
the
part
of
the
Negroes
as
they
became
more
educated
and
got
better
wages
.
But
this
situation
of
Kent
House
was
more
subtle
.
The
wages
involved
were
larger
and
more
regular
.
The
inmates
were
white
and
from
out
of
town
,
avoiding
local
friction
.
The
backing
from
the
white
town
was
greater
and
there
was
little
publicity
.
Good
wages
,
patronage
and
subscription
of
various
kinds
stopped
open
protest
from
Negroes
.
And
yet
Wilson
knew
that
this
place
must
go
or
he
must
go
.
And
for
him
to
leave
this
job
now
without
accomplishing
anything
would
mean
practically
the
end
of
his
career
in
the
Methodist
church
,
if
not
in
all
churches
.
Payne
dismounted
in
Madison
Place
and
handed
the
reins
to
Herold
.
There
was
a
fog
,
which
increased
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
Two
gas
lamps
were
no
more
than
a
misleading
glow
.
He
might
have
been
anywhere
or
nowhere
.
The
pretence
was
that
he
was
delivering
a
prescription
from
Dr.
Verdi
.
Secretary
of
State
Seward
was
a
sick
man
.
The
idea
had
come
from
Herold
,
who
had
once
been
a
chemist's
clerk
.
The
sick
were
always
receiving
medicines
.
No
one
would
question
such
an
errand
.
The
bottle
was
filled
up
with
flour
.
Before
Payne
loomed
the
Old
Clubhouse
,
Seward's
home
,
where
Key
had
once
been
killed
.
Now
it
would
have
another
death
.
From
the
outside
it
was
an
ordinary
enough
house
of
the
gentry
.
He
clomped
heavily
up
the
stoop
and
rang
the
bell
.
Like
the
bell
at
Mass
,
the
doorbell
was
pitched
too
high
.
It
was
still
Good
Friday
,
after
all
.
A
nigger
boy
opened
the
door
.
Payne
did
not
notice
him
.
He
was
thinking
chiefly
of
Cap
.
If
their
schedules
were
to
synchronize
,
there
was
no
point
in
wasting
time
.
He
pushed
his
way
inside
.
For
a
moment
the
hall
confused
him
.
This
was
the
largest
house
he
had
ever
been
in
,
almost
the
largest
building
,
except
for
a
hotel
.
He
had
no
idea
where
Seward's
room
would
be
.
In
the
half
darkness
the
banisters
gleamed
,
and
the
hall
seemed
enormous
.
Above
him
somewhere
were
the
bedrooms
.
Seward
would
be
up
there
.
He
explained
his
errand
,
but
without
bothering
much
to
make
it
plausible
,
for
he
felt
something
well
up
in
him
which
was
the
reason
why
he
had
fled
the
army
.
He
did
not
really
want
to
kill
,
but
as
in
the
sexual
act
,
there
was
a
moment
when
the
impulse
took
over
and
could
not
be
downed
,
even
while
you
watched
yourself
giving
way
to
it
.
He
was
no
longer
worried
.
Everything
would
be
all
right
.
He
knew
that
in
this
mood
he
could
not
be
stopped
.
Still
,
the
sensation
always
surprised
him
.
It
was
a
thrill
he
felt
no
part
in
.
He
could
only
watch
with
a
sort
of
gentle
dismay
while
his
body
did
these
quick
,
appalling
,
and
efficient
things
.
He
brushed
by
the
idiotic
boy
and
lumbered
heavily
up
the
stairs
.
They
were
carpeted
,
but
made
for
pumps
and
congress
gaiters
,
not
the
great
clodhoppers
he
wore
.
The
sound
of
his
footsteps
was
like
a
muffled
drum
.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
ran
into
somebody
standing
there
angrily
in
a
dressing
gown
.
He
stopped
and
whispered
his
errand
.
Young
Frederick
Seward
held
out
his
hand
.
Panting
a
little
,
Payne
shook
his
head
.
Dr.
Verdi
had
told
him
to
deliver
his
package
in
person
.
Frederick
Seward
said
his
father
was
sleeping
,
and
then
went
through
a
pantomime
at
his
father's
door
,
to
prove
the
statement
.
``
Very
well
''
,
Payne
said
.
``
I
will
go
''
.
He
smiled
,
but
now
that
he
knew
where
the
elder
Seward
was
,
he
did
not
intend
to
go
.
He
pulled
out
his
pistol
and
fired
it
.
It
made
no
sound
.
It
had
misfired
.
Reversing
it
,
he
smashed
the
butt
down
on
Frederick
Seward's
head
,
over
and
over
again
.
It
was
the
first
blow
that
was
always
difficult
.
After
that
,
violence
was
exultantly
easy
.
He
got
caught
up
into
it
and
became
a
different
person
.
Only
afterwards
did
an
act
like
that
become
meaningless
,
so
that
he
would
puzzle
over
it
for
days
,
whereas
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
quite
real
.
The
nigger
boy
fled
down
the
stairs
,
screaming
,
``
Murder
''
.
It
was
not
murder
at
all
.
Payne
was
more
methodical
than
that
.
He
was
merely
clearing
a
way
to
what
he
had
to
do
.
He
ran
for
the
sick
room
,
found
his
pistol
was
broken
,
and
threw
it
away
.
A
knife
would
do
.
From
childhood
he
had
known
all
about
knives
.
Someone
blocked
the
door
from
inside
.
He
smashed
it
in
and
tumbled
into
darkness
.
He
saw
only
dimly
moving
figures
,
but
when
he
slashed
them
they
yelled
and
fled
.
He
went
for
the
bed
,
jumped
on
it
,
and
struck
where
he
could
,
repeatedly
.
It
was
like
finally
getting
into
one's
own
nightmares
to
punish
one's
dreams
.
Two
men
pulled
him
off
.
Nobody
said
anything
.
Payne
hacked
at
their
arms
.
There
was
a
lady
there
,
in
a
nightdress
.
He
would
not
have
wanted
to
hurt
a
lady
.
Another
man
approached
,
this
one
fully
dressed
.
When
the
knife
went
into
his
chest
,
he
went
down
at
once
.
``
I'm
mad
''
,
shouted
Payne
,
as
he
ran
out
into
the
hall
.
``
I'm
mad
''
,
and
only
wished
he
had
been
.
That
would
have
made
things
so
much
easier
.
But
he
was
not
mad
.
He
was
only
dreaming
.
He
clattered
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
.
Somewhere
in
the
fog
,
the
nigger
boy
was
still
yelling
murder
.
One
always
wakes
up
,
even
from
one's
own
dreams
.
The
clammy
air
revived
him
.
Herold
,
he
saw
,
had
fled
.
Well
,
one
did
not
expect
much
of
people
like
Herold
.
He
unhitched
his
horse
,
walked
it
away
,
mounted
,
and
spurred
it
on
.
The
nigger
boy
was
close
behind
him
.
Then
the
nigger
boy
turned
back
and
he
was
alone
.
He
rode
on
and
on
.
He
had
no
idea
where
he
was
.
After
some
time
he
came
to
an
open
field
.
An
open
field
was
better
than
a
building
,
that
was
for
sure
,
so
he
dismounted
,
turned
off
the
horse
,
and
plunged
through
the
grass
.
He
felt
curiously
sleepy
,
the
world
seemed
far
away
;
;
he
knew
he
should
get
to
Cap
,
but
he
didn't
know
how
.
He
was
sure
,
for
he
had
done
as
he
was
told
,
hadn't
he
?
?
Cap
would
find
him
and
take
care
of
him
.
So
choosing
a
good
tree
,
he
clambered
up
into
it
,
found
a
comfortable
notch
,
and
curled
up
in
it
to
sleep
,
like
the
tousled
bear
he
was
,
with
his
hands
across
his
chest
,
as
though
surfeited
with
honey
.
Violence
always
made
him
tired
,
but
he
was
not
frightened
.
In
Boston
,
Edwin
Booth
was
winding
up
a
performance
of
A
New
Way
To
Pay
Old
Debts
.
It
was
a
part
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
did
not
bother
to
think
about
it
any
more
.
Acting
soothed
him
.
On
a
stage
he
always
knew
what
to
do
,
and
tonight
,
to
judge
by
the
applause
,
he
must
be
doing
it
better
than
usual
.
As
Sir
Giles
Overreach
(
how
often
had
he
had
to
play
that
part
,
who
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
)
,
he
raised
his
arm
and
declaimed
:
``
Where
is
my
honour
now
''
?
?
That
was
one
of
the
high
spots
of
the
play
.
The
audience
,
as
usual
,
loved
it
.
He
was
delighted
to
see
them
so
happy
.
If
he
had
any
worries
,
it
was
only
the
small
ones
,
about
Mother
in
New
York
,
and
his
daughter
Edwina
and
what
she
might
be
doing
at
this
hour
,
with
her
Aunt
Asia
,
in
Philadelphia
.
Everyone
is
ambivalent
about
his
profession
,
if
he
has
practised
it
long
enough
,
but
there
were
still
moments
when
he
loved
the
stage
and
all
those
unseen
people
out
there
,
who
might
cheer
you
or
boo
you
,
but
that
was
largely
,
though
not
entirely
,
up
to
you
.
They
made
the
world
seem
friendly
somehow
,
though
he
knew
it
was
not
.
7
,
Wilkes
was
quite
right
about
one
thing
.
Laura
Keene
had
been
in
the
green
room
.
The
commotion
had
brought
her
into
the
wings
.
Since
she
could
not
act
,
one
part
suited
her
as
well
as
any
other
,
and
so
she
was
the
first
person
to
offer
Mr.
Lincoln
a
glass
of
water
,
holding
it
up
to
the
box
,
high
above
her
head
,
to
Miss
Harris
,
who
had
asked
for
it
.
She
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
collect
her
wits
.
It
was
not
so
much
that
the
shot
had
stunned
the
audience
,
as
that
they
had
been
stunned
already
.
Most
of
them
had
seen
Our
American
Cousin
before
,
and
unless
Miss
Keene
was
on
stage
,
there
was
not
much
to
it
.
The
theatre
was
hot
and
they
were
drugged
with
boredom
.
The
stage
had
been
empty
,
except
for
Harry
Hawk
,
doing
his
star
monologue
.
The
audience
was
fond
of
Harry
Hawk
,
he
was
a
dear
,
in
or
out
of
character
,
but
he
was
not
particularly
funny
.
At
the
end
of
the
monologue
the
audience
would
applaud
.
Meanwhile
it
looked
at
the
scenery
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
know
enough
to
turn
you
inside
out
,
you
sockdologizing
old
mantrap
''
!
!
Said
Trenchard
,
otherwise
Hawk
.
There
was
always
a
pause
here
,
before
the
next
line
.
That
was
when
the
gun
went
off
.
Yet
even
that
explosion
did
not
mean
much
.
Guns
were
going
off
all
over
Washington
City
these
days
,
because
of
the
celebrations
,
and
the
theatre
was
not
soundproof
.
Then
the
audience
saw
a
small
,
dim
figure
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
Presidential
box
.
``
Sic
semper
tyrannis
''
,
it
said
mildly
.
Booth
had
delivered
his
line
.
Behind
him
billowed
a
small
pungent
cloud
of
smoke
.
They
strained
forward
.
They
had
not
heard
what
had
been
said
.
They
had
been
sitting
too
long
to
be
able
to
stand
up
easily
.
The
figure
leapt
from
the
box
,
almost
lost
its
balance
,
the
flag
draped
there
tore
in
the
air
,
the
figure
landed
on
its
left
leg
,
fell
on
its
hands
,
and
pressed
itself
up
.
Harry
Hawk
still
had
his
arm
raised
towards
the
wings
.
His
speech
faltered
.
He
did
not
lower
his
arm
.
The
figure
was
so
theatrically
dressed
,
that
it
was
as
though
a
character
from
some
other
play
had
blundered
into
this
one
.
The
play
for
Saturday
night
was
to
be
a
benefit
performance
of
The
Octoroon
.
This
figure
looked
like
the
slave
dealer
from
that
.
But
it
also
looked
like
a
toad
,
hopping
away
from
the
light
.
There
was
something
maimed
and
crazy
about
its
motion
that
disturbed
them
.
Then
it
disappeared
into
the
wings
.
Harry
Hawk
had
not
shifted
position
,
but
he
at
last
lowered
his
arm
.
Mrs.
Lincoln
screamed
.
There
was
no
mistaking
that
scream
.
It
was
what
anyone
who
had
ever
seen
her
had
always
expected
her
to
do
.
Yet
this
scream
had
a
different
note
in
it
.
That
absence
of
an
urgent
self-indulgence
dashed
them
awake
like
a
pail
of
water
.
Clara
Harris
,
one
of
the
guests
in
the
box
,
stood
up
and
demanded
water
.
Her
action
was
involuntary
.
When
something
unexpected
happened
,
one
always
asked
for
water
if
one
were
a
woman
,
brandy
if
one
were
a
man
.
Mrs.
Lincoln
screamed
again
.
In
the
Presidential
box
someone
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
yelled
:
``
He
has
shot
the
President
''
!
!
That
got
everybody
up
.
On
the
stage
,
Harry
Hawk
began
to
weep
.
Laura
Keene
brushed
by
him
with
the
glass
of
water
.
The
crowd
began
to
move
.
In
Washington
City
everyone
lived
in
a
bubble
of
plots
,
and
one
death
might
attract
another
.
It
was
not
exactly
panic
they
gave
way
to
,
but
they
could
not
just
sit
there
.
The
beehive
voices
,
for
no
one
could
bear
silence
,
drowned
out
the
sound
of
Mrs.
Lincoln's
weeping
.
At
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
,
upstairs
,
some
men
tried
to
push
open
the
door
to
the
box
corridor
.
It
would
not
give
.
A
Dr.
Charles
Taft
clambered
up
on
the
stage
and
got
the
actors
to
hoist
him
up
to
the
box
.
In
the
audience
a
man
named
Ferguson
lost
his
head
and
tried
to
rescue
a
little
girl
from
the
mob
,
on
the
same
principle
which
had
led
Miss
Harris
to
demand
water
.
Someone
opened
the
corridor
door
from
the
inside
,
and
called
for
a
doctor
.
Somehow
Dr.
Charles
Leale
was
forced
through
the
mob
and
squeezed
out
into
the
dingy
corridor
.
He
went
straight
to
the
Presidential
box
.
As
usual
,
Mrs.
Lincoln
had
lost
her
head
,
but
nobody
blamed
her
for
doing
so
now
.
There
was
a
little
blood
on
the
hem
of
her
dress
,
for
the
assassin
had
slashed
Miss
Harris's
companion
,
Major
Rathbone
,
with
a
knife
.
Rathbone
said
he
was
bleeding
to
death
.
By
the
look
of
him
he
wasn't
that
far
gone
.
With
a
sneer
,
the
man
spread
his
legs
and
,
a
third
time
,
confronted
them
.
Once
more
,
Katie
reared
,
and
whinnied
in
fear
.
For
a
moment
,
boy
and
mount
hung
in
midair
.
Stevie
twisted
and
,
frantically
,
commanded
the
mare
to
leap
straight
ahead
.
But
the
stranger
was
nimbler
still
.
With
a
bold
arm
,
he
dared
once
more
to
obstruct
them
.
Katie
reared
a
third
time
,
then
,
trembling
,
descended
.
The
stranger
leered
.
Seizing
the
bridle
,
he
tugged
with
all
his
might
and
forced
Katie
to
her
knees
.
It
was
absurd
.
Stevie
could
feel
himself
toppling
.
He
saw
the
ground
coming
up
--
and
the
stranger's
head
.
With
incredible
ferocity
,
he
brought
his
fists
together
and
struck
.
The
blow
encountered
silky
hair
and
hard
bone
.
The
man
uttered
a
weird
cry
,
spun
about
,
and
collapsed
in
the
sand
.
Katie
scrambled
to
her
feet
,
Stevie
agilely
retaining
his
seat
.
Again
Katie
reared
,
and
now
,
wickedly
,
he
compelled
her
to
bring
her
hooves
down
again
and
again
upon
the
sprawled
figure
of
the
stranger
.
He
could
feel
his
own
feet
,
iron-shod
,
striking
repeatedly
until
the
body
was
limp
.
He
gloated
,
and
his
lips
slavered
.
He
heard
himself
chortling
.
They
rode
around
and
around
to
trample
the
figure
into
the
sand
.
Only
the
top
of
the
head
,
with
a
spot
bare
and
white
as
a
clamshell
,
remained
visible
.
Stevie
was
shouting
triumphantly
.
A
train
hooted
.
Instantly
,
he
chilled
.
They
were
pursuing
him
.
He
was
frightened
;
;
his
fists
clutched
so
tightly
that
his
knuckles
hurt
.
Then
Katie
stumbled
,
and
again
he
was
falling
,
falling
!
!
``
Stevie
!
!
Stevie
''
!
!
His
mother
was
nudging
him
,
but
he
was
still
falling
.
His
head
hung
over
the
boards
of
Katie's
stall
;
;
before
it
was
sprawled
the
mangled
corpse
of
the
bearded
stranger
.
``
Stevie
,
wake
up
now
!
!
We're
nearly
there
''
.
He
had
been
dreaming
.
He
was
safe
in
his
Mama's
arms
.
The
train
had
slowed
.
Houses
winked
as
the
cars
rolled
beside
a
little
depot
.
``
Po'
Chavis
''
!
!
The
trainman
called
.
He
came
by
and
repeated
,
``
Po'
Chavis
''
!
!
Chapter
6
Bong
!
!
Bong
!
!
Startled
him
awake
.
The
room
vibrated
as
if
a
giant
hand
had
rocked
it
.
Bong
!
!
A
dull
boom
and
a
throbbing
echo
.
The
walls
bulged
,
the
floor
trembled
,
the
windowpanes
rattled
.
He
stared
at
the
far
morning
,
expecting
a
pendulum
to
swing
across
the
horizon
.
Bong
!
!
He
raced
to
the
window
and
yanked
at
the
sash
.
Bong
!
!
The
wood
was
old
,
the
paint
alligatored
.
Bong
!
!
A
fresh
breeze
saluted
him
.
Six
o'clock
!
!
He
put
his
head
out
.
There
was
the
slate
roof
of
the
church
;
;
ivy
climbed
the
red
brick
walls
like
a
green-scaled
monster
.
The
clock
which
had
struck
presented
an
innocent
face
.
In
the
kitchen
Mama
was
wiping
the
cupboards
.
``
There's
a
tower
and
a
steeple
on
the
church
a
million
feet
high
.
And
the
loudest
clock
in
the
whole
world
''
!
!
``
I
know
,
Stephen
''
,
she
smiled
.
``
They
say
that
our
steeple
is
one
hundred
and
sixty-two
feet
high
.
The
clock
you
heard
strike
--
it's
really
the
town
clock
--
was
installed
last
April
by
Mrs.
Shorter
,
on
her
birthday
''
.
He
dressed
,
and
sped
outdoors
.
He
crossed
Broome
Street
to
Orange
Square
.
The
steeple
leaned
backward
,
while
the
church
advanced
like
a
headless
creature
in
a
long
,
shapeless
coat
.
The
spire
seemed
to
hold
up
the
sky
.
Port
Jervis
,
basking
in
the
foothills
,
was
the
city
of
God
.
The
Dutch
Reformed
Church
,
with
two
steeples
and
its
own
school
was
on
Main
Street
;
;
the
Episcopal
Church
was
one
block
down
Sussex
Street
;
;
the
Catholic
Saint
Mary's
Church
,
with
an
even
taller
steeple
and
a
cross
on
top
,
stood
on
Ball
Street
.
The
Catholics
had
the
largest
cemetery
,
near
the
Neversink
River
where
Main
Street
ran
south
;
;
Stevie
whistled
when
he
passed
these
alien
grounds
.
God
was
everywhere
,
in
the
belfry
,
in
the
steeple
,
in
the
clouds
,
in
the
trees
,
and
in
the
mountains
hulking
on
the
horizon
.
Somewhere
,
beyond
,
where
shadows
lurked
,
must
be
the
yawning
pit
of
which
Papa
preached
and
the
dreadful
Lake
of
Fire
.
So
,
walking
in
awe
,
he
became
familiar
with
God
,
who
resided
chiefly
in
Drew
Centennial
Church
with
its
high
steeple
and
clock
.
There
was
no
church
like
Drew
Church
,
no
preacher
like
Papa
,
who
was
intimate
with
Him
,
and
could
consign
sinners
to
hellfire
.
To
know
God
he
must
follow
in
Papa's
footsteps
.
He
was
fortunate
,
and
proud
.
The
veterans
,
idling
on
their
benches
in
the
Square
,
beneath
the
soldiers'
monument
,
got
to
their
feet
when
Papa
approached
:
``
Morning
,
Reverend
''
!
!
His
being
and
His
will
--
Stevie
could
not
divide
God
from
his
Papa
--
illumined
every
parish
face
,
turned
the
choir
into
a
band
of
angels
,
and
the
pulpit
into
the
tollgate
to
Heaven
.
``
We
have
nine
hundred
and
eleven
members
in
our
charge
''
,
Mama
announced
,
``
and
three
hundred
and
eighty
Sunday-school
scholars
''
.
When
Papa
went
out
to
do
God's
work
,
Stevie
often
accompanied
him
in
the
buggy
,
which
was
drawn
by
Violet
,
the
new
black
mare
.
Although
they
journeyed
westerly
as
far
as
Germantown
,
beyond
the
Erie
roundhouse
and
the
machine
shop
,
and
along
the
Delaware
and
Hudson
Canal
,
and
northward
to
Brooklyn
,
below
Point
Peter
,
he
could
see
the
church
spire
wherever
he
looked
back
.
Sometimes
they
went
south
and
rolled
past
the
tollhouse
--
``
Afternoon
,
Reverend
''
!
!
--
and
crossed
the
suspension
bridge
to
Matamoras
;
;
that
was
Pennsylvania
.
In
the
Delaware
River
,
three
long
islands
were
overgrown
with
greening
trees
and
underbrush
.
South
of
Laurel
Grove
Cemetery
,
and
below
the
junction
of
the
Neversink
and
the
Delaware
,
was
the
Tri-State
Rock
,
from
which
Stevie
could
spy
New
Jersey
and
Pennsylvania
,
as
well
as
New
York
,
simply
by
spinning
around
on
his
heel
.
On
these
excursions
,
Papa
instructed
him
on
man's
chief
end
,
which
was
his
duty
to
God
and
his
own
salvation
.
However
,
a
boy's
lively
eyes
might
rove
.
Where
Cuddleback
Brook
purled
into
the
Neversink
was
a
magnificent
swimming
hole
.
Papa
pointed
a
scornful
finger
at
the
splashing
youth
:
``
Idle
recreation
''
!
!
Stevie
saw
no
idols
;
;
it
troubled
him
that
he
couldn't
always
see
what
Papa
saw
.
He
was
torn
between
the
excitement
in
the
sun-inflamed
waters
and
a
little
engine
chugging
northward
on
the
Monticello
Branch
.
``
Where
you
been
today
''
?
?
Ludie
inquired
every
evening
,
pretending
that
he
did
not
care
.
``
He'll
make
a
preacher
out
of
you
''
!
!
``
No
,
he
won't
''
!
!
Stevie
flared
.
``
Not
me
''
!
!
``
Somebody's
got
to
be
a
preacher
in
the
family
.
He
made
a
will
and
last
testament
before
we
left
Paterson
.
I
heard
them
!
!
Uncle
and
Aunt
Howe
were
the
witnesses
''
.
``
Will
he
die
''
?
?
``
Everybody
does
''
.
Ludie
could
be
hateful
.
To
speak
of
Papa
dying
was
a
sin
.
It
could
never
happen
as
long
as
God
was
alert
and
the
Drew
steeple
stood
guard
with
its
peaked
lance
.
Stevie
was
constantly
slipping
into
the
church
.
He
pulled
with
all
his
strength
at
the
heavy
,
brass-bound
door
,
and
shuffled
along
the
wainscoted
wall
.
The
cold
,
mysterious
presence
of
God
was
all
around
him
.
At
the
end
of
a
shaft
of
light
,
the
pews
appeared
to
be
broad
stairs
in
a
long
dungeon
.
Far
away
,
standing
before
a
curtained
window
in
the
study
room
,
was
his
father
,
hands
tucked
under
his
coattails
,
and
staring
into
the
dark
church
.
The
figure
was
wreathed
in
an
extraordinary
luminescence
.
The
boy
shuddered
at
the
deathly
pale
countenance
with
its
wrinkles
and
gray
hair
.
Would
Papa
really
die
?
?
The
mouth
was
thin-lipped
and
wide
,
the
long
cleft
in
the
upper
lip
like
a
slide
.
When
Papa's
slender
fingers
removed
the
spectacles
,
there
were
red
indentations
on
the
bridge
of
the
strong
nose
.
``
It's
time
you
began
to
think
on
God
,
Stephen
.
Perhaps
one
day
He
will
choose
you
as
He
chose
me
,
long
ago
.
Therefore
,
give
Him
your
affection
and
store
up
His
love
for
you
.
Open
your
heart
to
Him
and
pray
,
Stephen
,
pray
!
!
For
His
mercy
and
His
guidance
to
spare
you
from
evil
and
eternal
punishment
in
the
Lake
of
Fire
''
.
Stevie
had
heard
these
words
many
times
,
yet
on
each
occasion
they
caused
him
to
tremble
.
For
he
feared
the
Lake
of
Fire
.
He
strove
to
think
of
God
and
His
eternal
wrath
;
;
he
must
pray
to
be
spared
.
Papa
was
disappointed
that
none
of
the
brothers
had
heard
the
Call
.
Not
George
,
Townley
,
or
Ted
,
certainly
not
Ludie
.
Burt
was
at
Hackettstown
and
Will
at
Albany
Law
School
,
where
they
surely
could
not
hear
it
.
Someday
God
would
choose
him
.
He
would
hear
the
Call
and
would
run
to
tell
Papa
.
The
stern
face
would
relax
,
the
black-clad
arms
would
embrace
him
,
``
My
son
''
!
!
Yet
how
might
he
know
the
Call
when
it
came
?
?
Probably
,
as
in
Scriptures
,
a
still
,
small
voice
would
whisper
.
It
would
summon
him
once
;
;
if
he
missed
it
,
never
again
.
What
if
it
came
when
he
was
playing
,
or
was
asleep
and
dreaming
?
?
He
must
not
fail
to
hear
it
.
He
was
Papa's
chosen
;
;
therefore
,
nothing
but
good
could
happen
to
him
,
even
in
God's
wrathful
storms
.
When
the
skies
grew
dark
and
thunder
rolled
across
the
valley
,
he
was
unafraid
.
Aggie
might
fly
into
a
closet
,
shut
the
door
and
bury
her
head
in
the
clothes
;
;
he
dared
to
wait
for
the
lightning
.
Lightning
could
strike
you
blind
if
you
were
a
sinner
!
!
But
he
was
good
.
He
clenched
his
fists
and
faced
the
terror
.
Thunder
crashed
;
;
barrels
tumbled
down
the
mountainsides
,
and
bounced
and
bounced
till
their
own
fury
split
them
open
.
Lightning
might
strike
the
steeples
of
the
other
churches
;
;
not
of
Drew
Church
.
A
flash
illumined
the
trees
as
a
crooked
bolt
twigged
in
several
directions
.
Violet
whinnied
from
the
stable
.
He
ran
out
into
the
downpour
,
sped
across
the
yard
and
into
the
buggy
room
.
``
Don't
be
afraid
,
Violet
''
!
!
He
shouted
,
and
was
aghast
at
the
echoes
.
``
Don't
you
be
afraid
''
!
!
He
would
save
her
.
If
there
was
a
fire
or
a
flood
he
would
save
Mama
first
and
Violet
next
.
Drenched
and
shaking
,
he
stood
near
the
sweet-smelling
stall
and
dared
to
pat
her
muzzle
.
``
Don't
you
be
afraid
,
Violet
''
!
!
After
the
storm
,
the
sky
cleared
blue
and
cool
,
and
fragrant
air
swept
the
hills
.
When
the
sun
came
out
,
Stevie
strode
proudly
into
Orange
Square
,
smiling
like
a
landlord
on
industrious
tenants
.
The
fountain
had
brimmed
over
,
the
cannon
were
wet
,
the
soldiers'
monument
glistened
.
Even
before
the
benches
had
dried
,
the
Civil
War
veterans
were
straggling
back
to
their
places
.
The
great
spire
shone
as
if
the
lightning
had
polished
it
.
He
jumped
.
The
pointed
shadow
had
nearly
touched
him
.
He
trailed
Ludie
to
the
baseball
game
in
the
lot
on
Kingston
Street
near
the
Dutch
Reformed
.
``
Go
on
home
''
!
!
Ludie
screeched
at
him
.
``
Someone'll
tell
Papa
''
!
!
No
one
told
on
Ludie
,
not
even
when
he
slipped
live
grasshoppers
into
the
mite-box
.
Ludie
did
as
he
pleased
.
Ludie
took
his
slingshot
and
climbed
to
the
rooftop
to
shoot
at
crows
.
Ludie
chewed
roofer's
tar
.
Ludie
had
a
cigar
box
full
of
marbles
and
shooters
,
and
a
Roman
candle
from
last
Fourth
of
July
.
Ludie
hopped
rides
on
freight
cars
,
and
was
chased
by
Mr.
Yankton
,
the
railroad
guard
.
He
came
home
overheated
,
ran
straight
to
the
ice-chest
,
and
gulped
shivery
cold
water
.
Stevie
envied
him
.
That
Ludie
!
!
He
,
too
,
cocked
his
cap
at
a
jaunty
angle
,
jingled
marbles
in
his
pocket
,
and
swaggered
down
Main
Street
.
On
the
Christophers'
lawn
,
little
girls
in
white
pinafores
were
playing
grownups
at
a
tea
party
.
A
Newfoundland
sat
solemnly
beside
a
doghouse
half
his
size
.
Stevie
yearned
for
a
dog
.
He
wondered
whether
God
had
a
dog
in
the
sky
.
He
meandered
down
Pike
Street
,
past
the
First
National
Bank
with
its
green
window
shades
.
He
crossed
the
tracks
to
Delaware
House
,
where
ladies
in
gay
dresses
and
men
in
straw
boaters
and
waxed
mustaches
crowded
the
verandah
.
A
tall
lady
,
with
a
ruffled
collar
very
low
on
her
bosom
,
turned
insolent
green
eyes
upon
him
.
She
was
taller
than
Aggie
.
She
was
so
beautiful
with
her
rosy
mouth
and
haughty
air
that
she
had
to
be
wicked
.
Fiddles
screeched
;
;
a
piano
tinkled
.
``
P.
J.
''
--
as
Ludie
called
the
town
--
was
crowded
with
summer
people
who
came
to
the
mountains
to
escape
the
heat
in
the
big
cities
.
They
stayed
at
hotels
and
boardinghouses
,
or
at
private
homes
.
Rich
people
went
to
Delaware
House
,
Opera
House
,
American
House
or
Fowler
House
.
If
the
crummy
bastard
could
write
!
!
That's
how
it
should
be
.
It's
those
two
fucken
niggers
!
!
Krist
,
I
wish
they
could
write
!
!
Nigger
pussy
.
He
thought
of
sweet
wet
nigger
pussy
.
Oh
,
sweet
land
of
heaven
,
haint
there
just
nothin
like
sweet
nigger
pussy
!
!
He
thought
of
her
,
the
first
one
.
He
had
caught
her
coming
out
of
the
shack
.
She
was
a
juicy
one
.
Oh
how
they
bounced
!
!
Fresh
,
warm
,
sweet
and
juicy
,
sweet
lovin
sixteen
,
she
was
.
Man
,
how
I
love
nigger
pussy
!
!
The
snow
came
a
little
faster
now
,
he
noted
.
He
thought
of
Joe
Harris
,
the
nigger
who
had
gone
after
his
sister
.
He
chuckled
,
the
memory
vivid
.
Jee-sus
,
We
Fixed
him
!
!
Yooee
,
we
fixed
him
!
!
The
snow
again
.
If
only
the
fucken
weather
wasn't
so
lousy
!
!
Goddamn
niggers
,
Lord
.
What
I
have
to
put
up
with
!
!
Sonuvabitch
,
I
can't
figure
out
what
in
hell
for
they
went
and
put
niggers
in
my
squad
for
.
Only
one
worth
a
shit
,
and
that's
Brandon
.
He
ain't
so
bad
.
His
thoughts
turned
to
other
things
.
The
big
shock
everybody
had
when
they
found
ol
Slater
and
those
others
done
for
.
Kaboom
for
.
He
had
been
pretty
scared
himself
,
wondering
what
the
hell
was
coming
off
.
But
he
soon
saw
which
way
the
ball
was
bouncing
.
Soon
came
back
to
his
senses
.
``
I
soon
came
back
to
my
senses
''
,
he
said
,
aloud
,
to
the
young
blizzard
,
proudly
,
drawing
himself
up
,
as
if
making
a
report
to
some
important
superior
.
I
was
the
first
to
get
my
squad
on
the
ball
,
and
anybody
thinkin
it
was
easy
is
pretty
damn
dumb
.
Look
at
thum
.
That
goddamn
redheader
was
the
worst
.
He
kept
sayin
,
not
me
,
not
me
,
I
don't
wanta
wind
up
like
em
.
But
I
told
him
,
goddammit
.
``
I
told
him
''
,
he
said
aloud
They'll
get
the
guys
that
done
it
.
That'll
put
the
place
back
to
normal
.
Normal
,
by
God
.
Maybe
it's
a
good
thing
it
happened
.
Maybe
they'll
stop
it
now
,
once
for
all
.
Clean
the
place
up
.
They're
doin
it
now
.
I
hear
the
whole
bunch
is
croakin
out
in
the
snow
.
They'll
get
the
guys
that
done
it
.
There
was
something
troubling
him
though
:
as
yet
they
hadn't
Five
days
.
Keerist
.
Prickly
twinges
of
annoyance
ran
through
him
.
His
eyes
blinked
hard
,
snapping
on
and
squashing
some
bad
things
that
were
trying
to
push
their
way
into
him
.
A
tune
began
to
whirl
inside
his
head
.
One
of
his
favorites
:
``
Guitar
Boogie
''
.
It
always
came
on
,
faithfully
,
just
like
a
radio
or
juke
box
,
whenever
he
started
to
worry
too
much
about
something
,
when
the
bad
things
tried
to
push
their
way
into
him
.
The
music
drove
them
off
,
or
away
,
and
he
was
free
to
walk
on
air
in
a
very
few
moments
,
humming
and
jiving
within
,
beating
the
rhythm
within
.
He
glowed
with
anticipation
about
what
would
happen
to
the
culprits
when
they
caught
them
.
Turn
the
bastards
over
to
me
--
to
me
and
my
boys
--
no
nigger
ever
got
what
would
be
comin
to
them
--
reactionary
bastards
.
He
had
never
heard
the
word
reactionary
before
his
life
as
a
POW
began
.
It
was
a
word
he
was
proud
of
,
a
word
that
meant
much
to
him
,
and
he
used
it
with
great
pleasure
,
almost
as
if
it
were
an
exclusive
possession
,
and
more
:
he
sensed
himself
to
be
very
highly
educated
,
four
cuts
above
any
of
the
folks
back
home
.
``
Four
cuts
at
least
''
,
he
chuckled
to
himself
,
``
and
I
owe
it
all
to
them
''
.
The
word
also
made
him
feel
hate
,
sincere
hate
,
for
those
so
labeled
.
He
used
it
very
effectively
when
he
wanted
to
get
his
squad
on
the
ball
.
It
came
up
again
and
again
in
the
discussion
sessions
.
Lousy
Reactionary
bastards
been
tryin
to
fuck
up
the
Program
for
months
.
Months
.
Hired
,
hard
lackeys
of
the
Warmongering
capitalists
.
Not
captured
,
sent
here
.
To
fuck
up
the
program
.
You
guys
remember
that
.
Remember
that
He
heard
himself
haranguing
them
.
He
saw
himself
before
them
delivering
the
speech
.
He
laughed
,
suddenly
,
feeling
a
surge
of
power
telling
him
of
his
hold
over
them
,
seeing
himself
before
them
,
receiving
utmost
respect
and
attention
.
One
day
,
Ching
had
told
him
(
smiling
,
patting
him
on
the
back
)
as
they
walked
to
the
weekly
conference
of
squad
leaders
,
``
Keep
it
up
,
your
squad
is
good
,
one
of
the
best
,
keep
it
up
,
keep
up
the
good
work
''
.
He
would
!
!
That
was
really
something
,
coming
from
Ching
.
``
Really
something
''
,
he
said
,
aloud
.
Dirty
Reactionary
bastards
comin
down
here
in
the
night
and
bumpin
off
ol
Slater
and
those
other
poor
bastards
.
``
They'll
get
them
by
God
and
let
them
bring
them
down
here
to
me
,
just
let
them
,
God
,
I'll
slice
their
balls
right
off
.
''
His
arm
moved
swiftly
,
violently
,
once
,
twice
.
He
felt
intense
satisfaction
.
He
was
tingling
within
.
Before
him
,
mutilated
,
bleeding
to
death
,
they
lay
.
It
was
as
if
it
had
been
done
.
``
Bastards
''
,
he
said
aloud
,
spitting
on
them
.
He
halted
,
and
looked
around
.
Rivers
of
cold
sweat
were
suddenly
unleashed
within
him
.
The
thought
came
back
,
the
one
nagging
at
him
these
past
four
days
.
He
tried
to
stifle
it
.
But
the
words
were
forming
.
He
knew
he
couldn't
.
He
braced
himself
.
Somebody'll
hafta
start
thinkin
.
He
fought
it
,
seeking
to
kill
the
last
few
words
,
but
on
they
came
out
.
He
was
trembling
,
a
strange
feeling
upon
him
,
fully
expecting
some
catastrophe
to
strike
him
dead
on
the
spot
.
But
it
didn't
.
And
he
took
heart
;
;
the
final
word
came
forth
.
Now
he
heard
it
,
fully
;
;
``
bout
takin
his
place
''
He
listened
,
waited
,
nothing
happened
.
He
felt
good
.
His
old
self
.
The
music
arrived
,
taking
him
its
rhythm
.
Stroked
him
,
snaked
all
through
him
,
the
lyrics
lifted
him
,
took
him
from
one
magic
isle
to
another
,
stopping
briefly
at
each
Brandon
.
He
is
good
.
Damn
good
.
But
a
nigger
.
Johnson
.
Jesus
,
the
guy
says
he
is
trying
.
But
he
isn't
with
it
,
not
at
all
with
it
.
When
I
talked
to
Ching
about
it
,
he
said
,
Everyone
can
learn
,
if
he
is
not
a
Reactionary
or
lazy
.
No
one
is
stupid
.
That's
what
he
said
.
He
oughta
know
.
It
is
plain
as
hell
Johnson
is
no
reactionary
.
So
you're
not
tryin
,
Johnson
,
you
bastard
you
.
He
looked
over
at
him
,
lying
there
,
asleep
,
and
he
felt
a
wave
of
revulsion
.
How
he
loathed
him
.
Sleepy-eyed
,
soft-spoken
Johnson
,
Biggest
thorn
in
my
side
of
the
whole
fucken
squad
.
He
was
the
guy
what
always
goofed
at
Question
Time
.
Why
couldn't
they
have
dumped
him
off
on
someone
else
?
?
Why
me
?
?
Why
didn't
the
damn
Reactionaries
bump
him
off
?
?
Why
Slater
?
?
Like
a
particle
drawn
to
a
magnet
he
returned
to
that
which
was
pressing
so
hard
in
his
mind
.
The
music
surged
up
,
but
it
failed
to
check
it
.
Who
is
the
man
to
take
His
place
?
?
The
guy
with
most
on
the
Ball
.
Most
on
the
ball
.
Handle
men
.
Thoroughly
Wised
up
.
Knows
the
score
With
a
supreme
effort
,
he
broke
it
off
.
He
turned
to
the
window
again
.
A
gnawing
and
gnashing
within
him
.
The
snow
was
tumbling
down
furiously
now
.
Huge
glob-flakes
hitting
the
ground
,
piling
higher
and
higher
.
He
stared
at
it
,
amazed
,
alarmed
.
The
whole
fucken
sky's
cavin
in
!
!
Keeeerist
!
!
Lookit
it
!
!
Cover
the
whole
building
,
bury
us
all
,
by
nightfall
.
Jesus
!
!
Somebody
,
got
to
be
somebody
If
I
don't
put
my
two
cents
in
soon
,
somebody
else
will
I
know
they're
waitin
only
for
one
thing
:
for
the
bastards
what
done
it
to
be
nailed
.
Maybe
they
already
got
them
.
He
was
again
tingling
with
pleasure
,
seeing
himself
clearly
in
Slater's
shoes
.
Top
dog
,
sleeping
and
eating
right
there
with
the
Staff
.
Ching
,
Tien
,
all
of
them
.
Top
dog
.
Poor
ol
Slater
.
Jesus
,
imagine
,
the
crummy
bastards
,
they'll
get
em
,
they'll
get
what's
comin
to
em
.
He
whirled
about
suddenly
.
It
was
nothing
,
though
his
heart
was
thumping
wildly
.
Somebody
was
up
.
That
was
all
.
``
Boy
,
you're
stirrin
early
''
,
a
sleepy
voice
said
.
``
Yehhh
''
,
said
Coughlin
,
testily
,
eyeing
him
up
and
down
.
``
Lookit
that
come
down
,
willya
''
,
said
the
man
,
scratching
himself
,
yawning
.
``
Yehhh
''
,
said
Coughlin
,
practically
spitting
on
him
.
The
man
moved
away
.
That's
the
way
.
They'll
toe
the
line
.
Goddamn
it
.
Keep
the
chatter
to
a
minimum
,
short
answers
,
one
word
,
if
possible
.
Less
bull
the
more
you
can
do
with
em
.
That's
Brown's
trouble
.
All
he
does
is
to
bullshit
with
his
squad
,
and
they
are
the
stupidest
bastards
around
.
Just
about
to
get
their
asses
kicked
into
hut
Seven
.
Plenty
of
room
there
now
.
All
those
dumb
8-Balls
croaked
.
You
can
do
anything
with
these
dumb
fucks
if
you
know
how
.
Anything
.
They'd
cut
their
mothers'
belly
open
.
Give
um
the
works
.
See
,
he's
already
snapping
it
up
,
the
dumb
jerk
.
Coughlin
grinned
,
feeling
supremely
on
top
of
things
.
He
watched
the
snow
once
again
.
It
infuriated
him
.
It
made
no
sense
to
him
.
He
whirled
around
,
suddenly
hot
all
over
,
finding
the
man
who
had
been
standing
before
him
a
few
moments
back
,
nailing
him
to
the
spot
on
which
he
now
stood
,
open-mouthed
.
``
You
,
Listen
!
!
--
name
William
Foster's
Four
Internal
Contradictions
in
Capitalism
.
Quick
--
Quick
--
now
''
!
!
The
man
shrank
before
the
hot
fury
,
searching
frantically
for
the
answer
.
Finnegan
woke
up
.
There
was
a
hell
of
a
noise
this
time
of
morning
.
He
stared
out
the
window
.
For
Christ's
sake
!
!
The
whole
fucken
sky's
caved
in
!
!
He
looked
for
the
source
of
the
noise
that
had
awakened
him
.
It
was
that
prick
Coughlin
.
What
the
hell
was
he
up
to
now
?
?
Why
didn't
he
drop
dead
?
?
How
did
they
miss
him
when
they
got
Slater
?
?
How
?
?
Then
he
was
asking
himself
the
usual
early
morning
questions
:
What
the
Hell
am
I
doin
here
?
?
Is
this
a
nut-house
?
?
Am
I
nuts
?
?
Is
this
for
real
?
?
Am
I
dreamin
?
?
From
somewhere
in
the
hut
came
Coughlin's
voice
.
``
How
long
did
you
study
?
?
How
long
,
buddy
''
?
?
``
For
Christ's
sake
''
!
!
A
voice
pleaded
.
``
Don't
Christsake
me
,
buddy
!
!
Just
answer
.
C'mon
--
'mon
!
!
''
I'm
no
hero
.
Did
I
start
the
damn
war
?
?
Automatically
,
Finnegan
started
going
over
today's
lesson
.
Capitalism
rots
from
the
core
.
Did
I
start
the
damn
war
?
?
Who
did
?
?
That's
a
good
one
.
I
thought
I
knew
.
Why
don't
Uncle
Sam
mind
his
own
fucken
business
?
?
I'll
bet
both
together
did
.
I
bet
.
So
fuck
them
both
.
Goddamn
.
Goddammit
.
Just
let
me
go
home
to
Jersey
,
back
to
the
shore
,
oh
,
Jesus
,
the
shore
.
The
waves
breakin
in
on
you
and
your
girl
at
night
there
on
the
warm
beach
in
the
moonlight
.
If
I
hafta
do
this
to
stay
alive
by
God
I'll
do
it
.
I
hated
the
goddamn
army
from
the
first
day
I
got
in
anyhow
.
All
pricks
like
Coughlin
run
it
anyway
,
one
way
or
another
.
Fuck
them
.
He
rolled
over
and
tried
to
shut
out
the
noise
,
now
much
louder
.
He
snuggled
into
the
blanket
.
Brandon
dreamed
.
He
was
sitting
on
top
of
a
log
which
was
spinning
round
and
around
in
the
water
.
A
river
,
wide
as
the
Missouri
,
where
it
ran
by
his
place
.
The
log
was
spinning
.
But
he
was
not
.
So
what
?
?
Why
should
I
be
spinning
just
because
the
goddamn
log
is
spinning
?
?
(
he
asked
this
out
loud
,
but
no
one
heard
it
over
the
other
noise
in
the
hut
)
.
Over
on
the
bank
,
the
west
bank
,
a
man
stood
,
calling
to
him
.
He
couldn't
make
out
what
he
was
saying
.
No
doubt
it
had
to
do
with
the
log
.
Why
should
he
be
concerned
?
?
Rousseau
is
so
persuasive
that
Voltaire
is
almost
convinced
that
he
should
burn
his
books
,
too
.
But
while
the
two
men
are
riding
into
the
country
,
where
they
are
going
to
dinner
,
they
are
attacked
in
the
dark
of
the
forest
by
a
band
of
thieves
,
who
strip
them
of
everything
,
including
most
of
their
clothes
.
``
You
must
be
a
very
learned
man
''
,
says
Voltaire
to
one
of
the
bandits
.
``
A
learned
man
''
?
?
The
bandit
laughs
in
his
face
.
But
Voltaire
perseveres
.
He
goes
to
the
chief
himself
.
``
At
what
university
did
you
study
''
?
?
He
asks
.
He
refuses
to
believe
that
the
bandit
chief
never
attended
a
higher
institution
.
``
To
have
become
so
corrupt
''
,
he
says
,
``
surely
you
must
have
studied
many
arts
and
sciences
''
.
The
chief
,
annoyed
by
these
questions
,
knocks
Voltaire
down
and
shouts
at
him
that
he
not
only
never
went
to
any
school
,
but
never
even
learned
how
to
read
.
When
finally
the
two
bedraggled
men
reach
their
friend's
home
,
Voltaire's
fears
are
once
again
aroused
.
For
it
is
such
a
distinguished
place
,
with
such
fine
works
of
art
and
such
a
big
library
,
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
the
owner
has
become
depraved
by
all
this
culture
.
To
Voltaire's
surprise
,
however
,
their
host
gives
them
fresh
clothes
to
put
on
,
opens
his
purse
to
lend
them
money
and
sits
them
down
before
a
good
dinner
.
Immediately
after
dinner
,
however
,
Rousseau
asks
for
still
another
favor
.
Could
he
have
pen
and
paper
,
please
?
?
He
is
in
a
hurry
to
write
another
essay
against
culture
.
Such
was
the
impromptu
that
Voltaire
gave
to
howls
of
laughter
at
Sans
Souci
and
that
was
soon
circulated
in
manuscript
throughout
the
literary
circles
of
Europe
,
to
be
printed
sometime
later
,
but
with
the
name
of
Timon
of
Athens
,
the
famous
misanthrope
,
substituted
for
that
of
Rousseau
.
How
cruel
!
!
But
at
the
same
time
how
understandable
.
How
could
the
rich
,
for
whom
life
was
made
so
simple
,
ever
understand
the
subterfuges
,
the
lies
,
the
frauds
,
the
errors
,
sins
and
even
crimes
to
which
the
poor
were
driven
in
their
efforts
to
overcome
the
great
advantages
the
rich
had
in
the
race
of
life
?
?
How
,
for
example
,
could
a
Voltaire
understand
the
strange
predicament
in
which
a
Rousseau
would
find
himself
when
,
soon
after
the
furor
of
his
first
Discourse
,
he
acquired
still
another
title
to
fame
?
?
This
time
as
a
musician
.
As
a
composer
.
Ever
since
he
had
first
begun
to
study
music
and
to
teach
it
,
Rousseau
had
dreamed
of
piercing
through
to
fame
as
the
result
of
a
successful
opera
.
But
his
facility
in
this
genre
was
not
great
.
And
his
efforts
to
get
a
performance
for
his
Gallant
Muses
invariably
failed
.
And
for
good
reasons
.
His
operatic
music
had
little
merit
.
But
then
one
day
,
while
on
a
week's
visit
to
the
country
home
of
a
retired
Swiss
jeweler
,
Rousseau
amused
the
company
with
a
few
little
melodies
he
had
written
,
to
which
he
attached
no
great
importance
.
He
was
really
amazed
to
discover
the
other
guests
so
excited
about
these
delicate
little
songs
.
``
Put
a
few
such
songs
together
''
,
they
urged
him
.
``
String
them
onto
some
sort
of
little
plot
,
and
you'll
have
a
delightful
operetta
''
.
He
didn't
believe
them
.
``
Nonsense
''
,
he
said
.
``
This
is
the
sort
of
stuff
I
write
and
then
throw
away
''
!
!
``
Heaven
forbid
''
!
!
Cried
the
ladies
,
enchanted
by
his
music
.
``
You
must
make
an
opera
out
of
this
material
''
.
And
they
wouldn't
leave
off
arguing
and
pleading
until
he
had
promised
.
Oh
,
the
irony
and
the
bitterness
of
it
!
!
That
after
all
his
years
of
effort
to
become
a
composer
,
he
should
now
,
now
when
he
was
still
stoutly
replying
to
the
critics
of
his
Discourse
on
the
Arts
and
Sciences
,
be
so
close
to
a
success
in
music
and
have
to
reject
it
.
Or
at
least
appear
to
reject
it
!
!
But
what
else
could
he
do
?
?
You
couldn't
on
the
one
hand
decry
the
arts
and
at
the
same
time
practice
them
,
could
you
?
?
Well
,
yes
,
perhaps
in
literature
,
since
you
could
argue
that
you
couldn't
keep
silent
about
your
feelings
against
literature
and
so
were
involved
in
spite
of
yourself
.
But
now
music
too
?
?
No
.
That
would
be
too
much
!
!
And
the
fault
,
of
course
,
was
Rameau's
.
The
fault
was
Rameau's
and
that
of
the
whole
culture
of
this
Parisian
age
.
For
it
was
Rameau's
type
of
music
that
he
had
been
trying
to
write
,
and
that
he
couldn't
write
.
These
little
songs
,
however
,
were
sweet
nothings
from
the
heart
,
tender
memories
of
his
childhood
,
little
melodies
that
anyone
could
hum
and
that
would
make
one
want
to
weep
.
But
no
.
He
couldn't
appear
as
a
composer
now
.
That
glory
,
craved
for
so
long
,
was
now
forbidden
to
him
.
Still
,
just
for
the
ladies
,
and
just
for
this
once
,
for
this
one
weekend
in
the
country
,
he
would
make
a
little
piece
out
of
his
melodies
.
The
ladies
were
delighted
and
Jean
Jacques
was
applauded
.
And
everyone
went
to
work
to
learn
the
parts
which
he
wrote
.
But
then
,
after
the
little
operetta
had
been
given
its
feeble
amateur
rendering
,
everyone
insisted
that
it
was
too
good
to
be
lost
forever
,
and
that
the
Royal
Academy
of
Music
must
now
have
the
manuscript
in
order
to
give
it
the
really
first-rate
performance
it
merited
.
Rousseau
was
aware
that
he
must
seem
like
a
hypocrite
,
standing
there
and
arguing
that
he
could
not
possibly
permit
a
public
performance
.
The
ladies
especially
couldn't
understand
what
troubled
him
.
A
contradiction
?
?
Bah
,
what
was
a
contradiction
in
one's
life
?
?
Every
woman
has
had
the
experience
of
saying
no
when
she
meant
yes
,
and
saying
yes
when
she
meant
no
.
Rousseau
had
to
admit
that
though
he
couldn't
agree
to
a
public
performance
,
he
would
indeed
,
just
for
his
own
private
satisfaction
,
dearly
love
to
know
how
his
work
would
sound
when
done
by
professional
musicians
and
by
trained
voices
.
``
I'd
simply
like
to
know
if
it
is
as
good
as
you
kind
people
seem
to
think
''
,
he
said
.
Duclos
,
the
historian
,
pointed
out
to
Jean
Jacques
that
this
was
impossible
.
The
musicians
of
the
Royal
Opera
would
not
rehearse
a
work
merely
to
see
how
it
would
sound
.
Merely
to
satisfy
the
author's
curiosity
.
Rousseau
agreed
.
But
he
recalled
that
Rameau
had
once
had
a
private
performance
of
his
opera
Armide
,
behind
closed
doors
,
just
for
himself
alone
.
Duclos
understood
what
was
bothering
Rousseau
:
that
the
writer
of
the
Prosopopoeia
of
Fabricius
should
now
become
known
as
the
writer
of
an
amusing
little
operetta
.
That
would
certainly
be
paradoxical
.
But
Duclos
thought
he
saw
a
way
out
.
``
Let
me
do
the
submitting
to
the
Royal
Academy
''
,
he
suggested
.
``
Your
name
will
never
appear
.
No
one
will
even
suspect
that
it
is
your
work
''
.
To
that
Rousseau
could
agree
.
But
now
what
crazy
twists
and
turns
of
his
emotions
!
!
Afraid
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
his
work
might
be
turned
down
--
which
would
be
a
blow
to
his
pride
even
though
no
one
knew
he
was
the
author
--
and
that
the
work
would
be
accepted
,
and
then
that
his
violent
feelings
in
the
matter
would
certainly
betray
how
deeply
concerned
he
was
in
spite
of
himself
.
And
how
anxious
this
lover
of
obscurity
was
for
applause
!
!
And
thus
torn
between
his
desire
to
be
known
as
the
composer
of
a
successful
opera
and
the
necessity
of
remaining
true
to
his
proclaimed
desire
for
anonymity
,
Rousseau
suffered
through
several
painful
weeks
.
All
these
emotions
were
screwed
up
to
new
heights
when
,
after
acceptance
and
the
first
rehearsals
,
there
ensued
such
a
buzz
of
excitement
among
Parisian
music
lovers
that
Duclos
had
to
come
running
to
Rousseau
to
inform
him
that
the
news
had
reached
the
superintendent
of
the
King's
amusements
,
and
that
he
was
now
demanding
that
the
work
be
offered
first
at
the
royal
summer
palace
of
Fontainebleau
.
Imagine
the
honor
of
it
!
!
``
What
was
your
answer
''
?
?
Jean
Jacques
asked
,
striving
to
appear
unimpressed
.
``
I
refused
''
,
Duclos
said
.
``
What
else
could
I
do
?
?
Monsieur
De
Cury
was
incensed
,
of
course
.
But
I
said
I
would
first
have
to
get
the
author's
permission
.
And
I
was
certain
he
would
refuse
''
.
How
infuriating
all
this
was
!
!
Why
had
not
this
success
come
to
him
before
he
had
plunged
into
his
Discourse
,
and
before
he
had
committed
himself
to
a
life
of
austerity
and
denial
?
?
Now
,
when
everything
was
opening
up
to
him
--
even
the
court
of
Louis
15
!
!
--
he
had
to
play
a
role
of
self-effacement
.
Back
and
forth
Duclos
had
to
go
,
between
M.
De
Cury
and
Jean
Jacques
and
between
the
Duke
D'Aumont
and
Jean
Jacques
again
,
as
his
little
operetta
,
The
Village
Soothsayer
,
though
still
unperformed
,
took
on
ever
more
importance
.
And
of
course
the
news
of
who
the
composer
was
did
finally
begin
to
get
around
among
his
closest
friends
.
But
they
,
naturally
,
kept
his
secret
well
,
and
the
public
at
large
knew
only
of
a
great
excitement
in
musical
and
court
circles
.
How
titillating
it
was
to
go
among
people
who
did
not
know
him
as
the
composer
,
but
who
talked
in
the
most
glowing
terms
of
the
promise
of
the
piece
after
having
heard
the
first
rehearsals
.
The
furor
was
such
that
people
who
could
not
possibly
have
squirmed
their
way
into
the
rehearsals
were
pretending
that
they
were
intimate
with
the
whole
affair
and
that
it
would
be
sensational
.
And
listening
to
such
a
conversation
one
morning
while
taking
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
a
cafe
,
Rousseau
found
himself
bathed
in
perspiration
,
trembling
lest
his
authorship
become
known
,
and
at
the
same
time
dreaming
of
the
startling
effect
he
would
make
if
he
should
proclaim
himself
suddenly
as
the
composer
.
He
felt
himself
now
,
as
he
himself
says
in
his
Confessions
,
at
a
crucial
point
of
his
life
.
And
that
was
why
,
on
the
day
of
the
performance
,
when
a
carriage
from
the
royal
stables
called
to
take
him
to
the
palace
,
he
did
not
bother
to
shave
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
pleased
that
his
face
showed
a
neglect
of
several
days
.
Seeing
him
in
that
condition
,
and
about
to
enter
the
hall
where
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
the
whole
royal
family
and
all
the
members
of
the
highest
aristocracy
would
be
present
,
Grimm
and
the
Abbe
Raynal
and
others
tried
to
stop
him
.
``
You
can't
go
in
that
way
''
!
!
They
cried
.
``
Why
not
''
?
?
Jean
Jacques
asked
.
``
Who
is
going
to
stop
me
''
?
?
``
You
haven't
dressed
for
the
occasion
''
!
!
They
pointed
out
to
him
.
``
I'm
dressed
as
I
always
am
''
,
Rousseau
said
.
``
Neither
better
nor
worse
''
.
``
At
home
,
yes
''
,
they
argued
.
``
But
here
you
are
in
the
palace
.
There's
the
King
.
And
Madame
De
Pompadour
''
.
``
If
they
are
here
,
then
surely
I
have
the
right
to
be
here
''
,
Rousseau
said
.
``
And
even
more
right
.
Since
I
am
the
composer
''
!
!
``
But
in
such
a
slovenly
condition
''
.
``
What
is
slovenly
about
me
''
?
?
Rousseau
asked
.
``
Is
it
because
of
my
slovenliness
that
hair
grows
on
my
face
?
?
Surely
it
would
grow
there
whether
I
washed
myself
or
not
.
A
hundred
years
ago
I
would
have
worn
a
beard
with
pride
.
And
those
without
beards
would
have
stood
out
as
not
dressed
for
the
occasion
.
Now
times
have
changed
,
and
I
must
pretend
that
hair
doesn't
grow
on
my
face
.
That's
the
fashion
.
And
fashion
is
the
real
king
here
.
Not
Louis
15
,
,
since
even
he
obeys
.
Now
,
if
you
don't
mind
,
I
should
like
to
hear
my
own
piece
performed
''
.
But
of
course
behind
his
boldness
he
didn't
feel
bold
at
all
.
He
trembled
lest
his
piece
should
fail
.
And
this
in
addition
to
his
usual
fear
of
being
among
people
of
high
society
,
his
fear
of
making
some
inane
or
inappropriate
remark
.
And
even
deeper
than
that
:
his
fear
lest
in
this
closed
hall
he
should
suddenly
itch
to
relieve
himself
.
Could
he
walk
out
in
the
midst
of
his
piece
?
?
Here
,
before
the
court
?
?
Before
the
King
?
?
It
was
the
first
time
any
of
us
had
laughed
since
the
morning
began
.
The
rider
from
Concord
was
as
good
as
his
word
.
He
came
spurring
and
whooping
down
the
road
,
his
horse
kicking
up
clouds
of
dust
,
shouting
:
``
They're
a-coming
!
!
By
God
,
they're
a-coming
,
they
are
''
!
!
We
heard
him
before
he
ever
showed
,
and
we
heard
him
yelling
after
he
was
out
of
sight
.
Solomon
Chandler
hadn't
misjudged
the
strength
of
his
lungs
,
not
at
all
.
I
think
you
could
have
heard
him
a
mile
away
,
and
he
was
bursting
at
every
seam
with
importance
.
I
have
observed
that
being
up
on
a
horse
changes
the
whole
character
of
a
man
,
and
when
a
very
small
man
is
up
on
a
saddle
,
he'd
like
as
not
prefer
to
eat
his
meals
there
.
That's
understandable
,
and
I
appreciate
the
sentiment
.
As
for
this
rider
,
I
never
saw
him
before
or
afterwards
and
never
saw
him
dismounted
,
so
whether
he
stood
tall
or
short
in
his
shoes
,
I
can't
say
;
;
but
I
do
know
that
he
gave
the
day
tone
and
distinction
.
The
last
thing
in
the
world
that
resembled
a
war
was
our
line
of
farmers
and
storekeepers
and
mechanics
perched
on
top
of
a
stone
wall
,
and
this
dashing
rider
made
us
feel
a
good
deal
sharper
and
more
alert
to
the
situation
.
We
came
down
off
the
wall
as
if
he
had
toppled
all
of
us
,
and
we
crouched
behind
it
.
I
have
heard
people
talk
with
contempt
about
the
British
regulars
,
but
that
only
proves
that
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
things
of
which
they
are
deplorably
ignorant
.
Whatever
we
felt
about
the
redcoats
,
we
respected
them
in
terms
of
their
trade
,
which
was
killing
;
;
and
I
know
that
I
,
myself
,
was
nauseated
with
apprehension
and
fear
and
that
my
hands
were
soaking
wet
where
they
held
my
gun
.
I
wanted
to
wipe
my
flint
,
but
I
didn't
dare
to
,
the
state
my
hands
were
in
,
just
as
I
didn't
dare
to
do
anything
about
the
priming
.
The
gun
would
fire
or
not
,
just
as
chance
willed
.
I
put
a
lot
more
trust
in
my
two
legs
than
in
the
gun
,
because
the
most
important
thing
I
had
learned
about
war
was
that
you
could
run
away
and
survive
to
talk
about
it
.
The
gunfire
,
which
was
so
near
that
it
seemed
just
a
piece
up
the
road
now
,
stopped
for
long
enough
to
count
to
twenty
;
;
and
in
that
brief
interval
,
a
redcoat
officer
came
tearing
down
the
road
,
whipping
his
horse
fit
to
kill
.
I
don't
know
whether
he
was
after
our
rider
,
who
had
gone
by
a
minute
before
,
or
whether
he
was
simply
scouting
conditions
;
;
but
when
he
passed
us
by
,
a
musket
roared
,
and
he
reared
his
horse
,
swung
it
around
,
and
began
to
whip
it
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
.
He
was
a
fine
and
showy
rider
,
but
his
skill
was
wasted
on
us
.
From
above
me
and
somewhere
behind
me
,
a
rifle
cracked
.
The
redcoat
officer
collapsed
like
a
punctured
bolster
,
and
the
horse
reared
and
threw
him
from
the
saddle
,
except
that
one
booted
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
.
Half
crazed
by
the
weight
dragging
,
the
dust
,
and
the
heat
,
the
horse
leaped
our
wall
,
dashing
out
the
rider's
brains
against
it
,
and
leaving
him
lying
there
among
us
--
while
the
horse
crashed
away
through
the
brush
.
It
was
my
initiation
to
war
and
the
insane
symphony
war
plays
;
;
for
what
had
happened
on
the
common
was
only
terror
and
flight
;
;
but
this
grinning
,
broken
head
,
not
ten
feet
away
from
me
,
was
the
sharp
definition
of
what
my
reality
had
become
.
And
now
the
redcoats
were
coming
,
and
the
gunfire
was
a
part
of
the
dust
cloud
on
the
road
to
the
west
of
us
.
I
must
state
that
the
faster
things
happened
,
the
slower
they
happened
;
;
the
passage
and
rhythm
of
time
changed
,
and
when
I
remember
back
to
what
happened
then
,
each
event
is
a
separate
and
frozen
incident
.
In
my
recollection
,
there
was
a
long
interval
between
the
death
of
the
officer
and
the
appearance
of
the
first
of
the
retreating
redcoats
,
and
in
that
interval
the
dust
cloud
over
the
road
seems
to
hover
indefinitely
.
Yet
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
matter
of
seconds
,
and
then
the
front
of
the
British
army
came
into
view
.
It
was
only
hours
since
I
had
last
seen
them
,
but
they
had
changed
and
I
had
changed
.
In
the
very
front
rank
,
two
men
were
wounded
and
staggered
along
,
trailing
blood
behind
them
.
No
drummers
here
,
no
pipers
,
and
the
red
coats
were
covered
with
a
fine
film
of
dust
.
They
marched
with
bayonets
fixed
,
and
as
fixed
on
their
faces
was
anger
,
fear
,
and
torment
.
Rank
after
rank
of
them
came
down
the
road
,
and
the
faces
were
all
the
same
,
and
they
walked
in
a
sea
of
dust
.
``
Committeemen
,
hold
your
fire
!
!
Hold
your
fire
''
!
!
A
voice
called
,
and
what
made
it
even
more
terrible
and
unreal
was
that
the
redcoat
ranks
never
paused
for
an
instant
,
only
some
of
them
glancing
toward
the
stone
wall
,
from
behind
which
the
voice
came
.
The
front
of
their
column
had
already
passed
us
,
when
another
officer
came
riding
down
the
side
of
the
road
,
not
five
paces
from
where
we
were
.
My
Cousin
Simmons
carried
a
musket
,
but
he
had
loaded
it
with
bird
shot
,
and
as
the
officer
came
opposite
him
,
he
rose
up
behind
the
wall
and
fired
.
One
moment
there
was
a
man
in
the
saddle
;
;
the
next
a
headless
horror
on
a
horse
that
bolted
through
the
redcoat
ranks
,
and
during
the
next
second
or
two
,
we
all
of
us
fired
into
the
suddenly
disorganized
column
of
soldiers
.
One
moment
,
the
road
was
filled
with
disciplined
troops
,
marching
four
by
four
with
a
purpose
as
implacable
as
death
;
;
the
next
,
a
cloud
of
gun
smoke
covered
a
screaming
fury
of
sound
,
out
of
which
the
redcoat
soldiers
emerged
with
their
bayonets
and
their
cursing
fury
.
In
the
course
of
this
,
they
had
fired
on
us
;
;
but
I
have
no
memory
of
that
.
I
had
squeezed
the
trigger
of
my
own
gun
,
and
to
my
amazement
,
it
had
fired
and
kicked
back
into
my
shoulder
with
the
force
of
an
angry
mule
;
;
and
then
I
was
adding
my
own
voice
to
the
crescendo
of
sound
,
hurling
more
vile
language
than
I
ever
thought
I
knew
,
sobbing
and
shouting
,
and
aware
that
if
I
had
passed
water
before
,
it
was
not
enough
,
for
my
pants
were
soaking
wet
.
I
would
have
stood
there
and
died
there
if
left
to
myself
,
but
Cousin
Simmons
grabbed
my
arm
in
his
viselike
grip
and
fairly
plucked
me
out
of
there
;
;
and
then
I
came
to
some
sanity
and
plunged
away
with
such
extraordinary
speed
that
I
outdistanced
Cousin
Simmons
by
far
.
Everyone
else
was
running
.
Later
we
realized
that
the
redcoats
had
stopped
their
charge
at
the
wall
.
Their
only
hope
of
survival
was
to
hold
to
the
road
and
keep
marching
.
We
tumbled
to
a
stop
in
Deacon
Gordon's
cow
hole
,
a
low-lying
bit
of
pasture
with
a
muddy
pool
of
water
in
its
middle
.
A
dozen
cows
mooed
sadly
and
regarded
us
as
if
we
were
insane
,
as
perhaps
we
were
at
that
moment
,
with
the
crazy
excitement
of
our
first
encounter
,
the
yelling
and
shooting
still
continuing
up
at
the
road
,
and
the
thirst
of
some
of
the
men
,
which
was
so
great
that
they
waded
into
the
muddy
water
and
scooped
up
handfuls
of
it
.
Isaac
Pitt
,
one
of
the
men
from
Lincoln
,
had
taken
a
musket
ball
in
his
belly
;
;
and
though
he
had
found
the
strength
to
run
with
us
,
now
he
collapsed
and
lay
on
the
ground
,
dying
,
the
Reverend
holding
his
head
and
wiping
his
hot
brow
.
It
may
appear
that
we
were
cruel
and
callous
,
but
no
one
had
time
to
spend
sympathizing
with
poor
Isaac
--
except
the
Reverend
.
I
know
that
I
myself
felt
that
it
was
a
mortal
shame
for
a
man
to
be
torn
open
by
a
British
musket
ball
,
as
Isaac
had
been
,
yet
I
also
felt
relieved
and
lucky
that
it
had
been
him
and
not
myself
.
I
was
drunk
with
excitement
and
the
smell
of
gunpowder
that
came
floating
down
from
the
road
,
and
the
fact
that
I
was
not
afraid
now
,
but
only
waiting
to
know
what
to
do
next
.
Meanwhile
,
I
reloaded
my
gun
,
as
the
other
men
were
doing
.
We
were
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
,
and
we
could
trace
its
shape
from
the
ribbon
of
powder
smoke
and
dust
that
hung
over
it
.
Wherever
you
looked
,
you
saw
Committeemen
running
across
the
meadows
,
some
away
from
the
road
,
some
toward
it
,
some
parallel
to
it
;
;
and
about
a
mile
to
the
west
a
cluster
of
at
least
fifty
Militia
were
making
their
way
in
our
direction
.
Cousin
Joshua
and
some
others
felt
that
we
should
march
toward
Lexington
and
take
up
new
positions
ahead
of
the
slow-moving
British
column
,
but
another
group
maintained
that
we
should
stick
to
this
spot
and
this
section
of
road
.
I
didn't
offer
any
advice
,
but
I
certainly
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
where
the
officer
lay
with
his
brains
dashed
out
.
Someone
said
that
while
we
were
standing
here
and
arguing
about
it
,
the
British
would
be
gone
;
;
but
Cousin
Simmons
said
he
had
watched
them
marching
west
early
in
the
morning
,
and
moving
at
a
much
brisker
pace
it
had
still
taken
half
an
hour
for
their
column
to
pass
,
what
with
the
narrowness
of
the
road
and
their
baggage
and
ammunition
carts
.
While
this
was
being
discussed
,
we
saw
the
militia
to
the
west
of
us
fanning
out
and
breaking
into
little
clusters
of
two
and
three
men
as
they
approached
the
road
.
It
was
the
opinion
of
some
of
us
that
these
must
be
part
of
the
Committeemen
who
had
been
in
the
Battle
of
the
North
Bridge
,
which
entitled
them
to
a
sort
of
veteran
status
,
and
we
felt
that
if
they
employed
this
tactic
,
it
was
likely
enough
the
best
one
.
Mattathias
Dover
said
:
``
It
makes
sense
.
If
we
cluster
together
,
the
redcoats
can
make
an
advantage
out
of
it
,
but
there's
not
a
blessed
thing
they
can
do
with
two
or
three
of
us
except
chase
us
,
and
we
can
outrun
them
''
.
That
settled
it
,
and
we
broke
into
parties
of
two
and
three
.
Cousin
Joshua
Dover
decided
to
remain
with
the
Reverend
and
poor
Isaac
Pitt
until
life
passed
away
--
and
he
was
hurt
so
badly
he
did
not
seem
for
long
in
this
world
.
I
went
off
with
Cousin
Simmons
,
who
maintained
that
if
he
didn't
see
to
me
,
he
didn't
know
who
would
.
``
Good
heavens
,
Adam
''
,
he
said
,
``
I
thought
one
thing
you'd
have
no
trouble
learning
is
when
to
get
out
of
a
place
''
.
``
I
learned
that
now
''
,
I
said
.
We
ran
east
for
about
half
a
mile
before
we
turned
back
to
the
road
,
panting
from
the
effort
and
soaked
with
sweat
.
There
was
a
clump
of
trees
that
appeared
to
provide
cover
right
up
to
the
road
,
and
the
shouting
and
gunfire
never
slackened
.
Under
the
trees
,
there
was
a
dead
redcoat
,
a
young
boy
with
a
pasty
white
skin
and
a
face
full
of
pimples
,
who
had
taken
a
rifle
ball
directly
between
the
eyes
.
Three
men
were
around
him
.
They
had
stripped
him
of
his
musket
and
equipment
,
and
now
they
were
pulling
his
boots
and
jacket
off
.
Cousin
Simmons
grabbed
one
of
them
by
the
shoulder
and
flung
him
away
.
``
God's
name
,
what
are
you
to
rob
the
dead
with
the
fight
going
on
''
!
!
Cousin
Simmons
roared
.
They
tried
to
outface
him
,
but
Joseph
Simmons
was
as
wide
as
two
average
men
,
and
it
would
have
taken
braver
men
than
these
were
to
outface
him
.
That
summer
the
gambling
houses
were
closed
,
despite
the
threats
of
Pierre
Ameaux
,
a
gaming-card
manufacturer
.
Dancing
was
no
longer
permitted
in
the
streets
.
The
Bordel
and
other
places
of
prostitution
were
emptied
.
The
slit
breeches
had
to
go
.
Drunkenness
was
no
longer
tolerated
.
In
defiance
,
a
chinless
reprobate
,
Jake
Camaret
,
marched
down
the
aisle
in
St.
Peter's
one
Sunday
morning
,
followed
by
one
of
the
women
from
the
Bordel
,
whose
dress
and
walk
plainly
showed
the
lack
of
any
shame
.
Plunking
themselves
down
on
the
front
bench
,
they
turned
to
smirk
at
those
around
them
.
John's
first
impulse
was
to
denounce
their
blasphemy
.
But
the
thought
occurred
that
God
would
want
this
opportunity
used
to
tell
them
about
Him
.
Calmly
he
opened
the
Bible
and
read
of
the
woman
at
the
well
.
He
finished
the
worship
service
as
if
there
had
been
no
brazen
attempt
to
dishonor
God
and
man
.
The
next
morning
,
as
the
clock
struck
nine
,
he
appeared
at
the
Council
meeting
in
the
Town
Hall
and
insisted
that
the
couple
would
have
to
be
punished
if
the
Church
was
to
be
respected
.
``
I
have
told
you
before
,
and
I
tell
you
again
''
,
Monsieur
Favre
said
rudely
.
``
Stick
to
the
preaching
of
the
Gospel
''
!
!
John
stiffened
in
anger
.
``
That
is
the
answer
the
ungodly
will
always
make
when
the
Church
points
its
fingers
at
their
sins
.
I
say
to
you
that
the
Church
will
ever
decry
evil
''
!
!
John's
reply
was
like
a
declaration
of
war
.
Monsieur
Favre
sat
down
in
his
high-backed
stall
,
lips
compressed
,
eyes
glinting
.
Ablard
Corne
,
a
short
man
with
a
rotunda
of
stomach
,
rose
.
Every
eye
was
on
him
as
he
began
to
speak
.
``
What
Master
Calvin
says
is
true
.
How
can
we
have
a
good
city
unless
we
respect
morality
''
?
?
Abel
Poupin
,
a
tall
man
with
sunken
cheeks
and
deep-set
eyes
,
got
to
his
feet
.
``
We
all
know
that
Jake
Camaret
and
the
woman
are
brazenly
living
together
.
It
would
be
well
to
show
the
populace
how
we
deal
with
adulterers
''
.
Philibert
Berthelier
,
the
son
of
the
famous
patriot
,
disagreed
.
``
Do
not
listen
to
that
Frenchman
.
He
is
throttling
the
liberty
my
father
gave
his
life
to
win
''
!
!
John
was
quietly
insistent
.
``
There
can
be
no
compromise
when
souls
are
in
jeopardy
''
.
A
week
later
the
sentence
of
the
Council
was
carried
out
:
Jake
Camaret
and
the
woman
were
marched
naked
through
the
streets
past
a
mocking
populace
.
Before
them
stalked
the
beadle
,
proclaiming
as
he
went
,
``
Thus
the
Council
deals
with
those
who
break
its
laws
--
adulterers
,
thieves
,
murderers
,
and
lewd
persons
.
Let
evildoers
contemplate
their
ways
,
and
let
every
man
beware
''
!
!
John's
thoughts
raced
painfully
into
the
past
as
he
read
the
letter
he
had
just
received
from
his
sister
Mary
.
Charles
had
died
two
weeks
before
,
in
early
November
,
without
being
reconciled
to
the
Church
.
The
canons
,
in
a
body
,
had
tried
to
force
him
on
his
deathbed
to
let
them
give
him
the
last
rites
of
the
Church
,
but
he
had
died
still
proclaiming
salvation
by
faith
.
Burial
had
taken
place
at
night
in
the
ground
at
the
public
crossroads
under
the
gibbet
,
so
that
his
enemies
could
not
find
his
body
and
have
it
dug
up
and
burned
.
The
Abbot
of
St.
Eloi
,
Claude
De
Mommor
,
had
been
a
good
friend
,
but
not
even
he
thought
Charles
deserved
burial
in
hallowed
ground
.
John
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
once
again
the
little
niche
in
his
mother's
bedroom
,
where
she
had
knelt
to
tell
the
good
Virgin
of
her
needs
.
The
blue-draped
Virgin
was
still
there
,
but
no
one
knelt
before
her
now
.
Not
even
Varnessa
;
;
she
,
too
,
prayed
only
to
God
.
For
an
instant
John
longed
for
the
sound
of
the
bells
of
Noyon-la-Sainte
,
the
touch
of
his
mother's
hand
,
the
lilt
of
Charles's
voice
in
the
square
raftered
rooms
,
his
father's
bass
tones
rumbling
to
the
canons
,
and
the
sight
of
the
beloved
bishop
.
But
he
had
to
follow
the
light
.
Unless
God
expected
a
man
to
believe
the
Holy
Scriptures
,
why
had
He
given
them
to
him
?
?
The
white-clad
trees
stood
like
specters
in
the
February
night
.
Snow
buried
the
streets
and
covered
the
slanting
rooftops
,
as
John
trudged
toward
St.
Peter's
.
A
carriage
crunched
by
,
its
dim
lights
filtering
through
the
gloom
.
The
sharp
wind
slapped
at
him
and
his
feet
felt
like
ice
as
the
snow
penetrated
the
holes
of
his
shoes
,
his
only
ones
,
now
patched
with
folded
parchment
.
The
city
had
recently
given
him
a
small
salary
,
but
it
was
not
enough
to
supply
even
necessities
.
As
he
neared
the
square
,
a
round
figure
muffled
in
a
long
,
black
cape
whisked
by
.
John
recognized
Ablard
Corne
and
called
out
a
greeting
.
How
grateful
he
was
to
such
men
!
!
There
were
several
on
the
Council
who
tried
to
live
like
Christians
.
Despite
their
efforts
,
the
problems
seemed
to
grow
graver
all
the
time
.
Quickening
his
steps
,
John
entered
the
vast
church
and
climbed
the
tower
steps
to
the
bells
.
Underneath
the
big
one
,
in
the
silent
moonlight
,
lay
a
dead
pigeon
,
and
on
the
smaller
bell
,
the
Clemence
,
two
gray
and
white
birds
slept
huddled
together
in
the
cold
winter
air
.
John
leaned
upon
the
stone
balustrade
.
He
brushed
back
his
black
hair
,
shoving
it
under
his
pastor's
cap
to
keep
it
from
blowing
in
his
eyes
.
Below
the
moon-splashed
world
rolled
away
to
insurmountable
white
peaks
;
;
above
him
the
deep
blue
sky
glittered
with
stars
.
He
stood
very
still
,
his
arms
at
his
sides
,
staring
up
at
the
heavens
,
then
down
at
the
blinking
lights
below
.
``
How
long
,
my
Lord
?
?
How
long
?
?
I
have
never
asked
for
an
easy
task
,
but
I
am
weary
of
the
strife
''
.
Sleep
was
difficult
these
days
.
Indigestion
plagued
him
.
Severe
headaches
were
frequent
.
Loneliness
tore
through
him
like
a
physical
pain
whenever
he
thought
of
Peter
Robert
,
Nerien
,
Nicholas
Cop
,
Martin
Bucer
,
and
even
the
compromising
Louis
Du
Tillet
.
An
occasional
traveler
from
Italy
brought
news
of
Peter
Robert
,
who
was
now
distributing
his
Bible
among
the
Waldensian
peasants
.
Letters
came
regularly
from
Nerien
,
Nicholas
,
and
Martin
.
He
had
Anthony
and
William
to
confide
in
and
consult
.
But
William
continued
to
find
a
bitter
joy
in
smashing
images
and
tearing
down
symbols
sacred
to
the
Old
Church
.
John
found
it
difficult
,
but
he
held
him
in
check
.
And
Anthony
was
busy
most
of
the
time
courting
this
girl
and
that
.
His
easy
good
looks
made
him
a
favorite
with
the
ladies
.
Geneva
,
instead
of
becoming
the
City
of
God
,
as
John
had
dreamed
,
had
in
the
two
years
since
he
had
been
there
,
continued
to
be
a
godless
place
where
all
manner
of
vice
flourished
.
Refugees
poured
in
,
signing
the
Confession
and
rules
in
order
to
remain
,
and
then
disregarding
them
.
Dice
rolled
,
prostitutes
plied
their
trade
,
thieves
stole
,
murderers
stabbed
,
and
the
ungodly
blasphemed
.
Catholics
who
were
truly
Christians
longed
for
the
simple
penance
of
days
gone
by
.
Libertines
recalled
the
heroism
of
the
past
and
demanded
:
``
Are
we
going
to
allow
the
Protestant
Pope
,
Master
Calvin
,
to
curtail
our
liberty
?
?
Why
,
oh
why
,
doesn't
he
stick
to
preaching
the
Gospel
,
instead
of
meddling
in
civic
affairs
,
politics
,
economics
,
and
social
issues
that
are
no
concern
of
the
Church
''
?
?
And
John's
reply
was
always
the
same
:
``
Anything
that
affects
souls
is
the
concern
of
the
Church
!
!
We
will
have
righteousness
''
!
!
Tears
burned
behind
his
eyes
as
he
prayed
and
meditated
tonight
.
Unless
the
confusion
cleared
,
he
would
not
be
coming
here
much
longer
.
Monsieur
Favre's
threat
would
become
a
reality
,
for
he
continued
to
proclaim
loudly
that
the
city
must
rid
itself
of
``
that
Frenchman
''
.
The
slow
tapping
of
a
cane
on
the
stone
steps
coming
up
to
the
tower
interrupted
his
reverie
.
Faint
at
first
,
the
tapping
grew
until
it
sounded
loud
against
the
wind
.
Eli
Corault
!
!
John
thought
.
What
is
he
doing
here
at
this
hour
?
?
He
started
down
the
steps
to
meet
the
near-blind
preacher
,
who
had
been
one
of
the
early
Gospelers
in
Paris
.
``
John
?
?
Is
that
you
?
?
I
came
to
warn
you
of
a
plot
''
!
!
John
stood
above
him
,
his
face
ashen
.
What
now
?
?
Slowly
,
like
a
man
grown
old
,
he
took
Eli's
hand
and
led
him
below
to
the
tower
study
,
guiding
him
to
a
chair
beside
the
little
hearth
where
a
fire
still
burned
.
``
Plot
''
?
?
John
asked
tiredly
.
``
Monsieur
Favre
just
paid
me
a
visit
.
I
went
to
your
rooms
,
and
Anthony
told
me
you
were
here
.
Two
Anabaptists
,
Caroli
and
Benoit
,
are
to
challenge
you
and
William
to
a
debate
before
the
Council
.
It
is
to
be
a
trap
.
You
know
the
law
:
if
you
lose
the
debate
after
accepting
a
challenge
,
you
will
be
banished
''
!
!
``
What
will
be
the
subject
''
?
?
``
You
are
to
be
accused
of
Arianism
to
confuse
the
religious
who
remain
loyal
''
.
Anger
and
fear
fused
in
John
.
Ever
since
the
fourth
century
a
controversy
had
raged
over
the
person
of
Christ
.
Those
who
refused
to
believe
that
He
was
the
eternal
Son
of
God
were
termed
Arianists
.
Peter
Caroli
had
come
to
Geneva
,
saying
that
he
had
been
a
bishop
of
the
Church
of
Rome
and
had
been
persecuted
in
Paris
for
his
Reformed
faith
.
He
asked
to
be
appointed
a
preacher
.
But
Michael
Sept
had
unmasked
him
,
revealing
he
had
never
been
a
bishop
,
but
was
an
Anabaptist
,
afraid
to
state
his
faith
,
because
he
knew
John
Calvin
had
written
a
book
against
their
belief
that
the
soul
slept
after
death
.
So
John
had
refused
to
agree
to
his
appointment
as
a
preacher
,
and
now
Caroli
sought
revenge
.
John
sighed
.
``
If
William
agrees
,
we
should
insist
on
a
public
debate
''
,
he
said
at
length
.
``
There
is
more
to
the
conspiracy
.
Bern
demands
that
the
Lord's
Supper
be
administered
here
as
it
used
to
be
,
with
unleavened
bread
.
Furthermore
,
Bern
decrees
that
we
must
do
as
we
are
ordered
by
the
Council
,
preach
only
the
word
of
God
and
stop
meddling
in
politics
''
!
!
``
It
was
always
the
spirit
with
Christ
;
;
matters
such
as
leavened
or
unleavened
bread
are
inconsequential
.
Geneva
must
remain
a
sovereign
state
.
We
will
not
yield
to
the
demands
of
Bern
''
!
!
The
firelight
played
over
Eli's
flowing
white
locks
and
rugged
features
.
``
Monsieur
Favre
indicated
that
if
I
would
co-operate
,
after
you
and
William
are
banished
,
following
the
debate
,
I
will
be
given
a
place
of
influence
''
.
``
What
was
your
reply
to
that
''
?
?
``
That
I
would
rather
be
banished
with
two
such
Christians
than
be
made
the
Chief
Syndic
''
!
!
The
following
morning
,
as
John
entered
the
Place
Molard
on
his
way
to
visit
a
sick
refugee
,
he
had
a
premonition
of
danger
.
Then
suddenly
a
group
of
men
and
dogs
circled
him
.
He
wanted
to
run
,
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
,
he
would
be
lost
.
He
stood
very
still
,
his
heart
thumping
wildly
.
On
the
outskirts
of
the
rabble
the
Camaret
brothers
and
Gaspard
Favre
shook
their
fists
.
``
Are
you
going
to
comply
with
the
demands
of
Bern
''
?
?
The
chinless
Jake
called
.
``
Arianist
''
!
!
A
rowdy
with
a
big
blob
of
a
nose
roared
.
``
Heretic
''
!
!
John
lifted
his
hand
for
silence
.
``
Know
this
:
the
ministers
will
not
yield
to
the
demands
of
Bern
''
.
His
voice
shook
a
little
.
Somebody
heaved
a
stone
.
For
an
instant
John
was
stunned
.
When
he
felt
the
side
of
his
head
,
his
fingers
came
away
covered
with
blood
.
Before
he
could
duck
,
another
stone
struck
him
.
And
another
.
``
Let
him
be
now
''
!
!
Pierre
Ameaux
,
the
gaming-card
manufacturer
said
,
his
little
pig
eyes
glaring
.
``
We
have
taught
him
a
lesson
''
.
The
crowd
moved
back
and
John
started
dizzily
down
the
hill
.
Fists
pummeled
him
as
he
staggered
forward
.
Then
he
slipped
and
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
melting
snow
.
At
once
a
bevy
of
dogs
was
snapping
and
snarling
around
him
.
One
,
more
horrible
than
the
rest
,
lunged
,
growling
deep
in
his
throat
,
his
hair
bristling
.
With
great
difficulty
John
clambered
to
his
feet
and
started
to
run
,
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
.
Standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
tent
--
a
rejected
hospital
tent
on
which
the
rain
now
dripped
,
no
longer
drumming
--
Adam
watched
his
own
hands
touch
the
objects
on
the
improvised
counter
of
boards
laid
across
two
beer
barrels
.
There
was
,
of
course
,
no
real
need
to
rearrange
everything
.
A
quarter
inch
this
way
or
that
for
the
hardbake
,
or
the
toffee
,
or
the
barley
sugar
,
or
the
sardines
,
or
the
bitters
,
or
the
condensed
milk
,
or
the
stationery
,
or
the
needles
--
what
could
it
mean
?
?
Adam
watched
his
own
hands
make
the
caressing
,
anxious
movement
that
,
when
rain
falls
and
nobody
comes
,
and
ruin
draws
close
like
a
cat
rubbing
against
the
ankles
,
has
been
the
ritual
of
stall
vendors
,
forever
.
He
recognized
the
gesture
.
He
knew
its
meaning
.
He
had
seen
a
dry
,
old
,
yellowing
hand
reach
out
,
with
that
painful
solicitude
,
to
touch
,
to
rearrange
,
to
shift
aimlessly
,
some
object
worth
a
pfennig
.
Back
in
Bavaria
he
had
seen
that
gesture
,
and
at
that
sight
his
heart
had
always
died
within
him
.
On
such
occasions
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
look
at
the
face
above
the
hand
,
whatever
face
it
might
be
.
Now
the
face
was
his
own
.
He
wondered
what
expression
,
as
he
made
that
gesture
,
was
on
his
face
.
He
wondered
if
it
wore
the
old
anxiety
,
or
the
old
,
taut
stoicism
.
But
there
was
no
need
,
he
remembered
,
for
his
hand
to
reach
out
,
for
his
face
to
show
concern
or
stoicism
.
It
was
nothing
to
him
if
rain
fell
and
nobody
came
.
Then
why
was
he
assuming
the
role
--
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
?
?
What
was
he
expiating
?
?
Or
was
he
now
taking
the
role
--
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
--
because
it
was
the
only
way
to
affirm
his
history
and
identity
in
the
torpid
,
befogged
loneliness
of
this
land
.
This
was
Virginia
.
He
looked
out
of
the
tent
at
the
company
street
.
The
rain
dripped
on
the
freezing
loblolly
of
the
street
.
Beyond
that
misty
gray
of
the
rain
,
he
saw
the
stretching
hutment
,
low
diminutive
log
cabins
,
chinked
with
mud
,
with
doorways
a
man
would
have
to
crouch
to
get
through
,
with
roofs
of
tenting
laid
over
boughs
or
boards
from
hardtack
boxes
,
or
fence
rails
,
with
cranky
chimneys
of
sticks
and
dried
mud
.
The
chimney
of
the
hut
across
from
him
was
surmounted
by
a
beef
barrel
with
ends
knocked
out
.
In
this
heavy
air
,
however
,
that
device
did
not
seem
to
help
.
The
smoke
from
that
chimney
rose
as
sluggishly
as
smoke
from
any
other
,
and
hung
as
sadly
in
the
drizzle
,
creeping
back
down
along
the
sopping
canvas
of
the
roof
.
Over
the
door
was
a
board
with
large
,
inept
lettering
:
home
sweet
home
.
This
was
the
hut
of
Simms
Purdew
,
the
hero
.
The
men
were
huddled
in
those
lairs
.
Adam
knew
the
names
of
some
.
He
knew
the
faces
of
all
,
hairy
or
shaven
,
old
or
young
,
fat
or
thin
,
suffering
or
hardened
,
sad
or
gay
,
good
or
bad
.
When
they
stood
about
his
tent
,
chaffing
each
other
,
exchanging
their
obscenities
,
cursing
command
or
weather
,
he
had
studied
their
faces
.
He
had
had
the
need
to
understand
what
life
lurked
behind
the
mask
of
flesh
,
behind
the
oath
,
the
banter
,
the
sadness
.
Once
covertly
looking
at
Simms
Purdew
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
hated
,
he
had
seen
the
heavy
,
slack
,
bestubbled
jaw
open
and
close
to
emit
the
cruel
,
obscene
banter
,
and
had
seen
the
pale-blue
eyes
go
watery
with
whisky
and
merriment
,
and
suddenly
he
was
not
seeing
the
face
of
that
vile
creature
.
He
was
seeing
,
somehow
,
the
face
of
a
young
boy
,
the
boy
Simms
Purdew
must
once
have
been
,
a
boy
with
sorrel
hair
,
and
blue
eyes
dancing
with
gaiety
,
and
the
boy
mouth
grinning
trustfully
among
the
freckles
.
In
that
moment
of
vision
Adam
heard
the
voice
within
himself
saying
:
I
must
not
hate
him
,
I
must
not
hate
him
or
I
shall
die
.
His
heart
suddenly
opened
to
joy
.
He
thought
that
if
once
,
only
once
,
he
could
talk
with
Simms
Purdew
,
something
about
his
own
life
,
and
all
life
,
would
be
clear
and
simple
.
If
Simms
Purdew
would
turn
to
him
and
say
:
``
Adam
,
you
know
when
I
was
a
boy
,
it
was
a
funny
thing
happened
.
Lemme
tell
you
now
''
--
If
only
Simms
Purdew
could
do
that
,
whatever
the
thing
he
remembered
and
told
.
It
would
be
a
sign
for
the
untellable
,
and
he
,
Adam
,
would
understand
.
Now
,
Adam
,
in
the
gray
light
of
afternoon
,
stared
across
at
the
hut
opposite
his
tent
,
and
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
lying
in
there
in
the
gloom
,
snoring
on
his
bunk
,
with
the
fumes
of
whisky
choking
the
air
.
He
saw
the
sign
above
the
door
of
the
hut
:
home
sweet
home
.
He
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
poncho
coming
up
the
company
street
,
with
an
armful
of
wood
.
It
was
Pullen
James
,
the
campmate
of
Simms
Purdew
.
He
carried
the
wood
,
carried
the
water
,
did
the
cooking
,
cleaning
and
mending
,
and
occasionally
got
a
kick
in
the
butt
for
his
pains
.
Adam
watched
the
moisture
flow
from
the
poncho
.
It
gave
the
rubberized
fabric
a
dull
gleam
,
like
metal
.
Pullen
James
humbly
lowered
his
head
,
pushed
aside
the
hardtack-box
door
of
the
hut
,
and
was
gone
from
sight
.
Adam
stared
at
the
door
and
remembered
that
Simms
Purdew
had
been
awarded
the
Medal
of
Honor
for
gallantry
at
Antietam
.
The
street
was
again
empty
.
The
drizzle
was
slacking
off
now
,
but
the
light
was
grayer
.
With
enormous
interest
,
Adam
watched
his
hands
as
they
touched
and
shifted
the
objects
on
the
board
directly
before
him
.
Into
the
emptiness
of
the
street
,
and
his
spirit
,
moved
a
form
.
The
form
was
swathed
in
an
army
blanket
,
much
patched
,
fastened
at
the
neck
with
a
cord
.
From
under
the
shapeless
huddle
of
blanket
the
feet
moved
in
the
mud
.
The
feet
wore
army
shoes
,
in
obvious
disrepair
.
The
head
was
wrapped
in
a
turban
and
on
top
of
the
turban
rode
a
great
hamper
across
which
a
piece
of
poncho
had
been
flung
.
The
gray
face
stared
straight
ahead
in
the
drizzle
.
Moisture
ran
down
the
cheeks
,
gathered
at
the
tip
of
the
nose
,
and
at
the
chin
.
The
figure
was
close
enough
now
for
him
to
see
the
nose
twitching
to
dislodge
the
drop
clinging
there
.
The
figure
stopped
and
one
hand
was
perilously
freed
from
the
hamper
to
scratch
the
nose
.
Then
the
figure
moved
on
.
This
was
one
of
the
Irish
women
who
had
built
their
own
huts
down
near
the
river
.
They
did
washing
.
Adam
recognized
this
one
.
He
recognized
her
because
she
was
the
one
who
,
in
a
winter
twilight
,
on
the
edge
of
camp
,
had
once
stopped
him
and
reached
down
her
hand
to
touch
his
fly
.
``
Slice
o'
mutton
,
bhoy
''
?
?
She
had
queried
in
her
soft
guttural
.
``
Slice
o'
mutton
''
?
?
Her
name
was
Mollie
.
They
called
her
Mollie
the
Mutton
,
and
laughed
.
Looking
down
the
street
after
her
,
Adam
saw
that
she
had
again
stopped
and
again
removed
one
hand
from
the
basket
.
He
could
not
make
out
,
but
he
knew
that
again
she
was
scratching
her
nose
.
Mollie
the
Mutton
was
scratching
her
nose
.
The
words
ran
crazily
in
his
head
:
Mollie
the
Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
.
Then
the
words
fell
into
a
pattern
:
``
Mollie
the
Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
,
Scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
.
Mollie
the
Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
''
.
The
pattern
would
not
stop
.
It
came
again
and
again
.
He
felt
trapped
in
that
pattern
,
in
the
repetition
.
Suddenly
he
thought
he
might
weep
.
``
What's
the
matter
with
me
''
?
?
He
demanded
out
loud
.
He
looked
wildly
around
,
at
the
now
empty
street
,
at
the
mud
,
at
the
rain
.
``
Oh
,
what's
the
matter
with
me
''
?
?
He
demanded
.
When
he
had
stored
his
stock
in
the
great
oak
chest
,
locked
the
two
big
hasps
and
secured
the
additional
chain
,
tied
the
fly
of
the
tent
,
and
picked
up
the
cash
box
,
he
moved
up
the
darkening
street
.
He
would
consign
the
cash
box
into
the
hands
of
Jed
Hawksworth
,
then
stand
by
while
his
employer
checked
the
contents
and
the
list
of
items
sold
.
Then
he
--
Then
what
?
?
He
did
not
know
.
His
mind
closed
on
that
prospect
,
as
though
fog
had
descended
to
blot
out
a
valley
.
Far
off
,
in
the
dusk
,
he
heard
voices
singing
,
muffled
but
strong
.
In
one
of
the
huts
a
group
of
men
were
huddled
together
,
singing
.
He
stopped
.
He
strained
to
hear
.
He
heard
the
words
:
``
Rock
of
Ages
,
cleft
for
me
,
Let
me
hide
myself
in
Thee
!
!
Let
the
water
and
the
blood
From
Thy
riven
side
flow
!
!
''
He
thought
:
I
am
a
Jew
from
Bavaria
.
He
was
standing
there
,
he
thought
,
in
Virginia
,
in
the
thickening
dusk
,
in
a
costly
greatcoat
that
had
belonged
to
another
Jew
.
That
other
Jew
,
a
young
man
too
,
had
left
that
greatcoat
behind
,
in
a
rich
house
,
and
marched
away
.
He
had
crossed
the
river
which
now
,
beyond
the
woods
yonder
,
was
sliding
darkly
under
the
mist
.
He
had
plunged
into
the
dark
woods
beyond
.
He
had
died
there
.
What
had
that
man
,
that
other
young
Jew
,
felt
as
he
stood
in
the
twilight
and
heard
other
men
,
far
away
,
singing
together
?
?
Adam
thought
of
the
hutments
,
regiment
after
regiment
,
row
after
row
,
the
thousands
of
huts
,
stretching
away
into
the
night
.
He
thought
of
the
men
,
the
nameless
thousands
,
huddling
in
them
.
He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
snoring
on
his
bunk
while
Pullen
James
crouched
by
the
hearth
,
skirmishing
an
undershirt
for
lice
,
and
a
wet
log
sizzled
.
He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
,
who
once
had
risen
at
the
edge
of
a
cornfield
,
a
maniacal
scream
on
his
lips
,
and
swung
a
clubbed
musket
like
a
flail
to
beat
down
the
swirl
of
Rebel
bayonets
about
him
.
He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
rising
up
,
fearless
in
glory
.
He
felt
the
sweetness
of
pity
flood
through
him
,
veining
his
very
flesh
.
Those
men
,
lying
in
the
huts
,
they
did
not
know
.
They
did
not
know
who
they
were
or
know
their
own
worth
.
In
the
pity
for
them
his
loneliness
was
gone
.
Then
he
thought
of
Aaron
Blaustein
standing
in
his
rich
house
saying
:
``
God
is
tired
of
taking
the
blame
.
He
is
going
to
let
History
take
the
blame
for
a
while
''
.
He
thought
of
the
old
man
laughing
under
the
glitter
of
the
great
chandelier
.
He
thought
:
Only
in
my
heart
can
I
make
the
world
hang
together
.
Adam
rose
from
the
crouch
necessary
to
enter
the
hut
.
He
saw
Mose
squatting
by
the
hearth
,
breaking
up
hardtack
into
a
pan
.
A
pot
was
boiling
on
the
coals
.
``
Gonna
give
Ole
Buckra
all
his
money
''
?
?
Mose
asked
softly
.
Adam
nodded
.
``
Yeah
''
,
Mose
murmured
,
``
yeah
.
And
look
what
he
done
give
us
''
.
Adam
looked
at
the
pot
.
``
What
is
it
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
Chicken
''
,
Mose
said
,
and
theatrically
licked
his
lips
.
``
Gre't
big
fat
chicken
,
yeah
''
.
He
licked
his
lips
again
.
Then
:
``
yeah
.
A
chicken
with
six
tits
and
a
tail
lak
a
corkscrew
.
And
it
squealed
for
slop
''
.
Mose
giggled
.
``
Fooled
you
,
huh
?
?
It
is
the
same
ole
same
,
tell
me
its
name
.
It
is
sowbelly
with
tits
on
.
It
is
salt
po'k
.
It
is
salt
po'k
and
skippers
.
That
po'k
,
it
was
so
full
of
skippers
it
would
jump
and
run
and
not
come
when
you
say
,
hoo-pig
.
Had
to
put
my
foot
on
it
to
hole
it
down
while
I
cut
it
up
fer
the
lob-scuse
''
.
He
dumped
the
pan
of
crumbled
hardtack
into
the
boiling
pot
of
lobscouse
.
``
Good
ole
lob-scuse
''
,
he
mumbled
,
and
stirred
the
pot
.
He
stopped
stirring
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
.
``
Know
what
Ole
Buckra
et
tonight
''
?
?
He
demanded
.
``
Know
what
I
had
to
fix
fer
Ole
Him
''
?
?
Adam
shook
his
head
.
``
Chicken
''
,
Mose
said
.
She
was
a
child
too
much
a
part
of
her
environment
,
too
eager
to
grow
and
learn
and
experience
.
Once
,
they
were
at
Easthampton
for
the
summer
(
again
,
Fritzie
said
,
a
good
place
,
even
though
they
were
being
robbed
)
.
One
soft
evening
--
that
marvelous
sea-blessed
time
when
the
sun's
departing
warmth
lingers
and
a
smell
of
spume
and
wrack
haunts
everything
--
Amy
had
picked
herself
off
the
floor
and
begun
to
walk
.
Fritzie
was
on
the
couch
reading
;
;
Laura
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
about
eight
feet
away
.
The
infant
,
in
white
terry-cloth
bathrobe
,
her
face
intense
and
purposeful
,
had
essayed
a
few
wobbly
steps
toward
her
father
.
``
Y'all
wanna
walk
--
walk
''
,
he
said
.
Then
,
gently
,
he
shoved
her
behind
toward
Laura
.
Amy
walked
--
making
it
halfway
across
the
cottage
floor
.
She
lost
not
a
second
,
picking
herself
up
and
continuing
her
pilgrimage
to
Laura
.
Then
Laura
took
her
gently
and
shoved
her
off
again
,
toward
Fritzie
:
Amy
did
not
laugh
--
this
was
work
,
concentration
,
achievement
.
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
making
the
ten-foot
hike
unaided
;
;
soon
she
was
parading
around
the
house
,
flaunting
her
new
skill
.
Some
liar's
logic
,
a
wisp
of
optimism
as
fragile
as
the
scent
of
tropical
blossoms
that
came
through
the
window
(
a
euphoria
perhaps
engendered
by
the
pill
Fritzie
had
given
her
)
,
consoled
her
for
a
moment
.
Amy
had
to
be
safe
,
had
to
come
back
to
them
--
if
only
to
reap
that
share
of
life's
experiences
that
were
her
due
,
if
only
to
give
her
parents
another
chance
to
do
better
by
her
.
Through
the
swathings
of
terror
,
she
jabbed
deceit's
sharp
point
--
Amy
would
be
reborn
,
a
new
child
,
with
new
parents
,
living
under
new
circumstances
.
The
comfort
was
short-lived
,
yet
she
found
herself
returning
to
the
assurance
whenever
her
imagination
forced
images
on
her
too
awful
to
contemplate
without
the
prop
of
illusion
.
Gazing
at
her
husband's
drugged
body
,
his
chest
rising
and
falling
in
mindless
rhythms
,
she
saw
the
grandeur
of
his
fictional
world
,
that
lush
garden
from
which
he
plucked
flowers
and
herbs
.
She
envied
him
.
She
admired
him
.
In
the
darkness
,
she
saw
him
stirring
.
He
seemed
to
be
muttering
,
his
voice
surprisingly
clear
.
``
Y'all
should
have
let
me
take
that
money
out
''
,
Andrus
said
.
``
'nother
minute
I'd
have
been
fine
.
H'all
should
have
let
me
do
it
''
.
Laura
touched
his
hand
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
Fritzie
.
I
should
have
''
.
Tuesday
The
heat
intensified
on
Tuesday
.
Southern
California
gasped
and
blinked
under
an
autumn
hot
spell
,
drier
,
more
enervating
,
more
laden
with
man's
contrived
impurities
than
the
worst
days
of
the
summer
past
.
It
could
continue
this
way
,
hitting
106
and
more
in
the
Valley
,
Joe
McFeeley
knew
,
into
October
.
He
and
Irvin
Moll
were
sipping
coffee
at
the
breakfast
bar
.
Both
had
been
up
since
7:00
--
Irv
on
the
early-morning
watch
,
McFeeley
unable
to
sleep
during
his
four-hour
relief
.
The
night
before
,
they
had
telephoned
the
Andrus
maid
,
Selena
Masters
,
and
she
had
arrived
early
,
bursting
her
vigorous
presence
into
the
silent
house
with
an
assurance
that
amused
McFeeley
and
confounded
Moll
.
The
latter
,
thanking
her
for
the
coffee
,
had
winked
and
muttered
,
``
Sure
'nuff
,
honey
''
.
Selena
was
the
wrong
woman
for
these
crudities
.
With
a
hard
eye
,
she
informed
Moll
:
``
Don't
sure
'nuff
me
,
officer
.
I'm
honey
only
to
my
husband
,
understand
''
?
?
Sergeant
Moll
understood
.
The
maid
was
very
black
and
very
energetic
,
trim
in
a
yellow
pique
uniform
.
Her
speech
was
barren
of
southernisms
;
;
she
was
one
of
Eliot
Sparling's
neutralized
minorities
,
adopting
the
rolling
R's
and
constricted
vowels
of
Los
Angeles
.
Not
seeing
her
dark
intelligent
face
,
one
would
have
gauged
the
voice
as
that
of
a
Westwood
Village
matron
,
ten
years
out
of
Iowa
.
After
she
had
served
the
detectives
coffee
and
toast
(
they
politely
declined
eggs
,
uncomfortable
about
their
tenancy
)
,
she
settled
down
with
a
morning
newspaper
and
began
reading
the
stock
market
quotations
.
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
McFeeley
questioned
her
about
her
whereabouts
the
previous
day
,
any
recollections
she
had
of
people
hanging
around
,
of
overcurious
delivery
boys
or
repairmen
,
of
strange
cars
cruising
the
neighborhood
.
She
answered
him
precisely
,
missing
not
a
beat
in
her
scrutiny
of
the
financial
reports
.
Selena
Masters
,
Joe
realized
,
was
her
own
woman
.
She
was
the
only
kind
of
Negro
Laura
Andrus
would
want
around
:
independent
,
unservile
,
probably
charging
double
what
ordinary
maids
did
for
housework
--
and
doubly
efficient
.
When
the
parents
emerged
from
the
bedroom
a
few
minutes
later
,
the
maid
greeted
them
quietly
.
``
I'm
awful
sorry
about
what's
happened
''
,
Selena
said
.
``
Maybe
today'll
be
a
good-news
day
''
.
She
charged
off
to
the
bedrooms
.
Moll
took
his
coffee
into
the
nursery
.
During
the
night
,
a
phone
company
technician
had
deadened
the
bells
and
installed
red
blinkers
on
the
phones
.
Someone
would
have
to
remain
in
the
office
continually
.
McFeeley
greeted
the
parents
,
then
studied
his
notebook
.
He
wanted
to
take
the
mother
to
headquarters
at
once
and
start
her
on
the
mug
file
.
``
Sleep
well
''
?
?
He
asked
.
Andrus
did
not
answer
him
.
His
face
was
bloated
with
drugging
,
redder
than
normal
.
The
woman
had
the
glassy
look
of
an
invalid
,
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at
all
.
``
Oh
--
we
managed
''
,
she
said
.
``
I'm
a
little
groggy
.
Did
anything
happen
during
the
night
''
?
?
``
Few
crank
calls
''
,
McFeeley
said
.
``
A
couple
of
tips
we're
running
down
--
nothing
promising
.
We
can
expect
more
of
the
same
.
Too
bad
your
number
is
in
the
directory
''
.
``
Didn't
occur
to
me
my
child
would
be
kidnaped
when
I
had
it
listed
''
,
Andrus
muttered
.
He
settled
on
the
sofa
with
his
coffee
,
warming
his
hands
on
the
cup
,
although
the
room
was
heavy
with
heat
.
The
three
had
little
to
say
to
each
other
.
The
previous
night's
horror
--
the
absolute
failure
,
overcast
with
the
intrusions
of
the
press
,
had
left
them
all
with
a
wan
sense
of
uselessness
,
of
play-acting
.
Sipping
their
coffee
,
discussing
the
weather
,
the
day's
shopping
,
Fritzie's
commitments
at
the
network
(
all
of
which
he
would
cancel
)
,
they
avoided
the
radio
,
the
morning
TV
news
show
,
even
the
front
page
of
the
Santa
Luisa
Register
,
resting
on
the
kitchen
bar
.
Kidnaper
spurns
ransom
;
;
Amy
still
missing
.
Once
,
Andrus
walked
by
it
,
hastily
scanned
the
bold
black
headline
and
the
five-column
lead
of
the
article
(
by
Duane
Bosch
,
staff
correspondent
--
age
not
given
)
,
and
muttered
:
``
We
a
buncha
national
celebrities
''
.
McFeeley
told
the
parents
he
would
escort
them
to
police
headquarters
in
a
half
hour
.
Before
that
,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
neighbors
.
He
did
not
want
to
bring
the
Andruses
to
the
station
house
too
early
--
Rheinholdt
had
summoned
a
press
conference
,
and
he
didn't
want
them
subjected
to
the
reporters
again
.
He
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
tell
them
:
no
assurances
,
no
hopeful
hints
at
great
discoveries
that
day
.
When
the
detective
left
,
Andrus
phoned
his
secretary
to
cancel
his
work
and
to
advise
the
network
to
get
a
substitute
director
for
his
current
project
.
Mrs.
Andrus
was
talking
to
the
maid
,
arranging
for
her
to
come
in
every
day
,
instead
of
the
four
days
she
now
worked
.
Outside
,
only
a
handful
of
reporters
remained
.
The
bulk
of
the
press
corps
was
covering
Rheinholdt's
conference
.
In
contrast
to
the
caravan
of
the
previous
night
,
there
were
only
four
cars
parked
across
the
street
.
Two
men
he
did
not
recognize
were
sipping
coffee
and
munching
sweet
rolls
.
He
did
not
see
Sparling
,
or
DeGroot
,
or
Ringel
,
or
any
of
the
feverish
crew
that
had
so
harassed
him
twelve
hours
ago
.
However
,
the
litter
remained
,
augmented
by
several
dozen
lunchroom
suppers
.
The
street
cleaner
had
not
yet
been
around
.
One
of
the
reporters
called
to
him
:
``
Anything
new
,
Lieutenant
''
?
?
And
he
ignored
him
,
skirting
the
parked
cars
and
walking
up
the
path
to
the
Skopas
house
.
When
McFeeley
was
halfway
to
the
door
,
the
proprietor
emerged
--
a
mountainous
,
dark
man
,
his
head
thick
with
resiny
black
hair
,
his
eyes
like
two
of
the
black
olives
he
imported
in
boatloads
.
McFeeley
identified
himself
.
The
master
of
the
house
,
his
nourished
face
unrevealing
,
consented
to
postpone
his
departure
a
few
minutes
to
talk
to
the
detective
.
Inside
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Skopas
had
disclosed
--
in
a
hoarse
whisper
--
the
detective's
errand
,
his
family
gathered
in
a
huddle
,
forming
a
mass
of
dark
flesh
on
and
around
a
brocaded
sofa
which
stood
at
one
side
of
a
baroque
fireplace
.
Flanked
by
marble
urns
and
alabaster
lamps
,
they
seemed
to
be
posing
for
a
tribal
portrait
.
It
was
amazing
how
they
had
herded
together
for
protection
:
an
enormous
matriarch
in
a
quilted
silk
wrapper
,
rising
from
the
breakfast
table
;
;
a
gross
boy
in
his
teens
,
shuffling
in
from
the
kitchen
with
a
sandwich
in
his
hands
;
;
a
girl
in
her
twenties
,
fat
and
sullen
,
descending
the
marble
staircase
;
;
then
all
four
gathering
on
the
sofa
to
face
the
inquisitor
.
They
answered
him
in
monosyllables
,
nods
,
occasionally
muttering
in
Greek
to
one
another
,
awaiting
the
word
from
Papa
,
who
restlessly
cracked
his
knuckles
,
anxious
to
stuff
himself
into
his
white
Cadillac
and
burst
off
to
the
freeway
.
No
,
they
hadn't
seen
anyone
around
;
;
no
,
they
didn't
know
the
Andrus
family
;
;
yes
,
they
had
read
about
the
case
;
;
yes
,
they
had
let
some
reporters
use
their
phone
,
but
they
would
no
longer
.
They
offered
no
opinions
,
volunteered
nothing
,
betrayed
no
emotions
.
Studying
them
,
McFeeley
could
not
help
make
comparison
with
the
Andrus
couple
.
The
Skopas
people
seemed
to
him
of
that
breed
of
human
beings
whose
insularity
frees
them
from
tragedy
.
He
imagined
they
were
the
kind
whose
tax
returns
were
never
examined
(
if
they
were
,
they
were
never
penalized
)
,
whose
children
had
no
unhappy
romances
,
whose
names
never
knew
scandal
.
The
equation
was
simple
:
wealth
brought
them
happiness
,
and
their
united
front
to
the
world
was
their
warning
that
they
meant
to
keep
everything
they
had
,
let
no
one
in
on
the
secrets
.
By
comparison
,
Fritzie
and
Laura
Andrus
were
quivering
fledglings
.
They
possessed
no
outer
fortifications
,
no
hard
shells
of
confidence
;
;
they
had
enough
difficulty
getting
from
day
to
day
,
let
alone
having
an
awful
crime
thrust
upon
them
.
Skopas
expressed
no
curiosity
over
the
case
,
offered
no
expression
of
sympathy
,
made
no
move
to
escort
McFeely
to
the
door
.
All
four
remained
impacted
on
the
sofa
until
he
had
left
.
He
had
spoken
to
Mrs.
.
Emerson
the
previous
day
.
There
remained
a
family
named
Kahler
,
owners
of
a
two-story
Tudor-style
house
on
the
south
side
of
the
Andrus
home
.
Their
names
had
not
come
up
in
any
discussions
with
Laura
,
and
he
had
no
idea
what
they
would
be
like
.
McFeeley
noted
the
immaculate
lawn
and
gardens
:
each
blade
of
grass
cropped
,
bright
and
firm
;
;
each
shrub
glazed
with
good
health
.
The
door
was
answered
by
a
slender
man
in
his
sixties
--
straight-backed
,
somewhat
clerical
in
manner
,
wearing
rimless
glasses
.
When
Joe
identified
himself
,
he
nodded
,
unsmiling
,
and
ushered
him
into
a
sedate
living
room
.
Mrs.
Kahler
joined
them
.
She
had
a
dried-out
quality
--
a
gray
,
lean
woman
,
not
unattractive
.
Both
were
dressed
rather
formally
.
The
man
wore
a
vest
and
a
tie
,
the
woman
had
on
a
dark
green
dress
and
three
strands
of
pearls
.
``
Funny
thing
''
,
Mr.
Kahler
said
,
when
they
were
seated
,
``
when
I
heard
you
ringing
,
I
figured
it
was
that
guy
down
the
block
,
Hausman
''
.
McFeeley
looked
puzzled
.
Kahler
continued
:
``
I
fixed
his
dog
the
other
day
and
I
guess
he's
sore
,
so
I
expected
him
to
come
barging
in
''
.
Mr.
Kahler
went
on
to
explain
how
Hausman's
fox
terrier
had
been
``
making
''
in
his
flower
beds
.
The
dog
refused
to
be
scared
off
,
so
Kahler
had
purchased
some
small
firecrackers
.
He
would
lay
in
wait
in
the
garage
,
and
when
the
terrier
came
scratching
around
,
he'd
let
fly
with
a
cherry
bomb
.
``
Scared
the
hell
out
of
him
''
,
Kahler
grinned
.
``
I
hit
him
in
the
ass
once
''
.
Both
grinned
at
the
detective
.
``
Finally
,
all
I
needed
was
to
throw
a
little
piece
of
red
wood
that
looked
like
a
firecracker
and
that
dumb
dog
would
run
ki-yi-ing
for
his
life
''
.
In
the
dim
underwater
light
they
dressed
and
straightened
up
the
room
,
and
then
they
went
across
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
.
She
was
intimidated
by
the
stove
.
He
found
the
pilot
light
and
turned
on
one
of
the
burners
for
her
.
The
gas
flamed
up
two
inches
high
.
They
found
the
teakettle
.
And
put
water
on
to
boil
and
then
searched
through
the
icebox
.
Several
sections
of
a
loaf
of
dark
bread
;
;
butter
;
;
jam
;
;
a
tiny
cake
of
ice
.
In
their
search
for
what
turned
out
to
be
the
right
breakfast
china
but
the
wrong
table
silver
,
they
opened
every
cupboard
door
in
the
kitchen
and
pantry
.
While
she
was
settling
the
teacart
,
he
went
back
across
the
hall
to
their
bedroom
,
opened
one
of
the
suitcases
,
and
took
out
powdered
coffee
and
sugar
.
She
appeared
with
the
teacart
and
he
opened
the
windows
.
``
Do
you
want
to
call
Eugene
''
?
?
He
didn't
,
but
it
was
not
really
a
question
,
and
so
he
left
the
room
,
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
front
of
the
apartment
,
hesitated
,
and
then
knocked
lightly
on
the
closed
door
of
the
study
.
A
sleepy
voice
answered
.
``
Le
petit
dejeuner
''
,
Harold
said
,
in
an
accent
that
did
credit
to
Miss
Sloan
,
his
high-school
French
teacher
.
At
the
same
time
,
his
voice
betrayed
uncertainty
about
their
being
here
,
and
conveyed
an
appeal
to
whatever
is
reasonable
,
peace-loving
,
and
dependable
in
everybody
.
Since
ordinary
breakfast-table
conversation
was
impossible
,
it
was
at
least
something
that
they
were
able
to
offer
Eugene
the
sugar
bowl
with
their
sugar
in
it
,
and
the
plate
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
that
Eugene
could
return
the
pitcher
of
hot
milk
to
them
handle
first
.
Eugene
put
a
spoonful
of
powdered
coffee
into
his
cup
and
then
filled
it
with
hot
water
.
Stirring
,
he
said
:
``
I
am
sorry
that
my
work
prevents
me
from
doing
anything
with
you
today
''
.
They
assured
him
that
they
did
not
expect
or
need
to
be
entertained
.
Harold
put
a
teaspoonful
of
powdered
coffee
in
his
cup
and
filled
it
with
hot
water
,
and
then
,
stirring
,
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
.
The
chair
creaked
.
Every
time
he
moved
or
said
something
,
the
chair
creaked
again
.
Eugene
was
not
entirely
silent
,
or
openly
rude
--
unless
asking
Harold
to
move
to
another
chair
and
placing
himself
in
the
fauteuil
that
creaked
so
alarmingly
was
an
act
of
rudeness
.
It
went
right
on
creaking
under
his
own
considerable
weight
,
and
all
it
needed
,
Harold
thought
,
was
for
somebody
to
fling
himself
back
in
a
fit
of
laughter
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
.
Through
the
open
window
they
heard
sounds
below
in
the
street
:
cartwheels
,
a
tired
horse's
plodding
step
,
voices
.
Harold
indicated
the
photograph
on
the
wall
and
asked
what
church
the
stone
sculpture
was
in
.
Eugene
told
him
and
he
promptly
forgot
.
They
passed
the
marmalade
,
the
bread
,
the
black-market
butter
,
back
and
forth
.
Nothing
was
said
about
hotels
or
train
journeys
.
Eugene
offered
Harold
his
car
,
to
use
at
any
time
he
cared
to
,
and
when
this
offer
was
not
accepted
,
the
armchair
creaked
.
They
all
three
had
another
cup
of
coffee
.
Eugene
was
in
his
pajamas
and
dressing
gown
,
and
on
his
large
feet
he
wore
yellow
Turkish
slippers
that
turned
up
at
the
toes
.
``
Excuse
me
''
,
he
said
in
Berlitz
English
,
and
got
up
and
left
them
,
to
bathe
and
dress
.
The
first
shrill
ring
of
the
telephone
brought
Harold
out
into
the
hall
.
He
realized
that
he
had
no
idea
where
the
telephone
was
.
At
that
moment
the
bathroom
door
flew
open
and
Eugene
came
out
,
with
his
face
lathered
for
shaving
,
and
strode
down
the
hall
,
tying
the
sash
of
his
dressing
gown
as
he
went
.
The
telephone
was
in
the
study
but
the
ringing
came
from
the
hall
.
Between
the
telephone
and
the
wall
plug
there
was
sixty
feet
of
cord
,
and
when
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
,
Eugene
carried
the
instrument
with
him
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
,
to
his
bathroom
,
where
it
rang
three
more
times
while
he
was
shaving
and
in
the
tub
.
Before
he
left
the
apartment
he
knocked
on
their
door
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
them
.
Harold
shook
his
head
.
``
Sabine
called
a
few
minutes
ago
''
,
Eugene
said
.
``
She
wants
you
and
Barbara
to
have
dinner
with
her
tomorrow
night
''
.
He
handed
Harold
a
key
to
the
front
door
,
and
cautioned
him
against
leaving
it
unlocked
while
they
were
out
of
the
apartment
.
When
enough
time
had
elapsed
so
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
his
returning
for
something
he
had
forgotten
,
Harold
went
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
looking
into
one
room
after
another
.
In
the
room
next
to
theirs
was
a
huge
cradle
,
of
mahogany
,
ornately
carved
and
decorated
with
gold
leaf
.
It
was
the
most
important-looking
cradle
he
had
ever
seen
.
Then
came
their
bathroom
,
and
then
a
bedroom
that
,
judging
by
the
photographs
on
the
walls
,
must
belong
to
Mme
Cestre
.
A
young
woman
who
looked
like
Alix
,
with
her
two
children
.
Alix
and
Eugene
on
their
wedding
day
.
Matching
photographs
in
oval
frames
of
Mme
Bonenfant
and
an
elderly
man
who
must
be
Alix's
grandfather
.
Mme
Vienot
,
considerably
younger
and
very
different
.
The
schoolboy
.
And
a
gray-haired
man
whose
glance
--
direct
,
lifelike
,
and
mildly
accusing
--
was
contradicted
by
the
gilt
and
black
frame
.
It
was
the
kind
of
frame
that
is
only
put
around
the
photograph
of
a
dead
person
.
Professor
Cestre
,
could
it
be
?
?
With
the
metal
shutters
closed
,
the
dining
room
was
so
dark
that
it
seemed
still
night
in
there
.
One
of
the
drawing-room
shutters
was
partly
open
and
he
made
out
the
shapes
of
chairs
and
sofas
,
which
seemed
to
be
upholstered
in
brown
or
russet
velvet
.
The
curtains
were
of
the
same
material
,
and
there
were
some
big
oil
paintings
--
portraits
in
the
style
of
Lancret
and
Boucher
.
Though
,
taken
individually
,
the
big
rooms
were
,
or
seemed
to
be
,
square
,
the
apartment
as
a
whole
formed
a
triangle
.
The
apex
,
the
study
where
Eugene
slept
,
was
light
and
bright
and
airy
and
cheerful
.
The
window
looked
out
on
the
Place
Redoute
--
it
was
the
only
window
of
the
apartment
that
did
.
Looking
around
slowly
,
he
saw
a
marble
fireplace
,
a
desk
,
a
low
bookcase
of
mahogany
with
criss-crossed
brass
wire
instead
of
glass
panes
in
the
doors
.
The
daybed
Eugene
had
slept
in
,
made
up
now
with
its
dark-brown
velours
cover
and
pillows
.
The
portable
record
player
with
a
pile
of
classical
records
beside
it
.
Beethoven's
Fifth
was
the
one
on
top
.
Da-da-da-dum
Music
could
not
be
Eugene's
passion
.
Besides
,
the
records
were
dusty
.
He
tried
the
doors
of
the
bookcase
.
Locked
.
The
titles
he
could
read
easily
through
the
criss-crossed
wires
:
works
on
theology
,
astral
physics
,
history
,
biology
,
political
science
.
No
poetry
.
No
novels
.
He
moved
over
to
the
desk
and
stood
looking
at
the
papers
on
it
but
not
touching
anything
.
The
clock
on
the
mantel
piece
was
scandalized
and
ticked
so
loudly
that
he
glanced
at
it
over
his
shoulder
and
then
quickly
left
the
room
.
The
concierge
called
out
to
them
as
they
were
passing
through
the
foyer
.
Her
quarters
were
on
the
right
as
you
walked
into
the
building
,
and
her
small
front
room
was
clogged
with
heavy
furniture
--
a
big
,
round
,
oak
dining
table
and
chairs
,
a
buffet
,
with
a
row
of
unclaimed
letters
inserted
between
the
mirror
and
its
frame
.
The
suitcases
had
come
while
they
were
out
,
and
had
been
put
in
their
room
,
the
concierge
said
.
He
waited
until
they
were
inside
the
elevator
and
then
said
:
``
Now
what
do
we
do
''
?
?
``
Call
the
Vouillemont
,
I
guess
''
.
``
I
guess
''
.
Rather
than
sit
around
waiting
for
the
suitcases
to
be
delivered
,
they
had
gone
sight-seeing
.
They
went
to
the
Flea
Market
,
expecting
to
find
the
treasures
of
Europe
,
and
found
instead
a
duplication
of
that
long
double
row
of
booths
in
Tours
.
Cheap
clothing
and
junk
of
every
sort
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
.
They
looked
,
even
so
.
Looked
at
everything
.
Barbara
bought
some
cotton
aprons
,
and
Harold
bought
shoestrings
.
They
had
lunch
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
overlooking
the
intersection
of
two
broad
,
busy
,
unpicturesque
streets
,
and
coming
home
they
got
lost
in
the
Metro
;
;
it
took
them
over
an
hour
to
get
back
to
the
station
where
they
should
have
changed
,
in
order
to
take
the
line
that
went
to
the
Place
Redoute
.
It
was
the
end
of
the
afternoon
when
he
took
the
huge
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
into
the
keyhole
.
When
he
opened
the
door
,
there
stood
Eugene
,
on
his
way
out
of
the
apartment
.
He
was
wearing
sneakers
and
shorts
and
an
open-collared
shirt
,
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
little
black
bag
.
He
did
not
explain
where
he
was
going
,
and
they
did
not
ask
.
Instead
,
they
went
on
down
the
hall
to
their
room
.
``
Do
you
think
he
could
be
having
an
affair
''
?
?
Barbara
asked
,
as
they
heard
the
front
door
close
.
``
Oh
no
''
,
Harold
said
,
shocked
.
``
Well
,
this
is
France
,
after
all
''
.
``
I
know
,
but
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
.
He's
probably
spending
the
evening
with
friends
''
.
``
And
for
that
he
needs
a
little
bag
''
?
?
They
went
shopping
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
bought
two
loaves
of
bread
with
the
ration
coupons
they
had
been
given
in
Blois
,
and
some
cheese
,
and
a
dozen
eggs
,
and
a
bag
of
oranges
from
a
peddler
in
the
Place
Redoute
--
the
first
oranges
they
had
seen
since
they
landed
.
They
had
Vermouth
,
sitting
in
front
of
a
cafe
.
When
they
got
home
Harold
was
grateful
for
the
stillness
in
the
apartment
,
and
thought
how
,
under
different
circumstances
,
they
might
have
stayed
on
here
,
in
these
old-fashioned
,
high-ceilinged
rooms
that
reminded
him
of
the
Irelands'
apartment
in
the
East
Eighties
.
They
could
have
been
perfectly
happy
here
for
ten
whole
days
.
He
went
down
the
hall
to
Eugene's
bathroom
,
to
turn
on
the
hot-water
heater
,
and
on
the
side
of
the
tub
he
saw
a
pair
of
blue
wool
swimming
trunks
.
He
felt
them
.
They
were
damp
.
He
reached
out
and
felt
the
bath
towel
hanging
on
the
towel
rack
over
the
tub
.
Damp
also
.
He
looked
around
the
room
and
then
called
out
:
``
Come
here
,
quick
''
?
?
``
What
is
it
''
?
?
Barbara
asked
,
standing
in
the
doorway
.
``
I've
solved
the
mystery
of
the
little
bag
.
There
it
is
and
there
is
what
was
in
it
.
But
where
do
people
go
swimming
in
Paris
?
?
That
boat
in
the
river
,
maybe
''
.
``
What
boat
''
?
?
``
There's
a
big
boat
anchored
near
the
Place
De
La
Concorde
,
with
a
swimming
pool
in
it
--
didn't
you
notice
it
?
?
But
if
he
has
time
to
go
swimming
,
he
had
time
to
be
with
us
''
.
She
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.
``
I
know
''
,
he
said
,
reading
her
mind
.
``
I
don't
know
what
I'm
going
to
do
with
you
''
.
``
It's
because
we
are
in
France
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
know
so
few
people
.
So
something
like
this
matters
more
than
it
would
at
home
.
Also
,
he
was
so
nice
when
he
was
nice
''
.
``
All
because
I
didn't
feel
like
dancing
''
.
``
I
don't
think
it
was
that
,
really
''
.
``
Then
what
was
it
''
?
?
``
I
don't
know
.
I
wish
I
did
.
The
tweed
coat
,
maybe
.
The
thing
about
Eugene
is
that
he's
very
proud
''
.
And
the
thing
about
hurt
feelings
,
the
wet
bathing
suit
pointed
out
,
is
that
the
person
who
has
them
is
not
quite
the
innocent
party
he
believes
himself
to
be
.
For
instance
--
what
about
all
those
people
Harold
Rhodes
went
toward
unhesitatingly
,
as
if
this
were
the
one
moment
they
would
ever
have
together
,
their
one
chance
of
knowing
each
other
?
?
Fortunately
,
the
embarrassing
questions
raised
by
objects
do
not
need
to
be
answered
,
or
we
would
all
have
to
go
sleep
in
the
open
fields
.
And
in
any
case
,
answers
may
clarify
but
they
do
not
change
anything
.
He
brought
with
him
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
,
of
about
a
hundred
pounds'
weight
.
They
took
Jesus's
body
,
then
,
and
wrapped
it
in
winding-clothes
with
the
spices
;
;
that
is
how
the
Jews
prepare
a
body
for
burial
.
Listed
as
present
at
the
Descent
were
Mary
,
Mary's
sister
,
Mary
Magdalene
,
John
,
Joseph
of
Arimathea
,
Nicodemus
.
Search
as
he
might
,
he
could
find
no
place
where
the
Bible
spoke
of
a
moment
when
Mary
could
have
been
alone
with
Jesus
.
Mostly
the
scene
was
crowded
with
mourners
,
such
as
the
dramatic
Dell'Arca
Lamentation
in
Bologna
,
where
the
grief-stricken
spectators
had
usurped
Mary's
last
poignant
moment
.
In
his
concept
there
could
be
no
one
else
present
.
His
first
desire
was
to
create
a
mother
and
son
alone
in
the
universe
.
When
might
Mary
have
had
that
moment
to
hold
her
child
on
her
lap
?
?
Perhaps
after
the
soldiers
had
laid
him
on
the
ground
,
while
Joseph
of
Arimathea
was
at
Pontius
Pilate's
asking
for
Christ's
body
,
Nicodemus
was
gathering
his
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
,
and
the
others
had
gone
home
to
mourn
.
Those
who
saw
his
finished
Pieta
would
take
the
place
of
the
biblical
witnesses
.
They
would
feel
what
Mary
was
undergoing
.
There
would
be
no
halos
,
no
angels
.
These
would
be
two
human
beings
,
whom
God
had
chosen
.
He
felt
close
to
Mary
,
having
spent
so
long
concentrating
on
the
beginning
of
her
journey
.
Now
she
was
intensely
alive
,
anguished
;
;
her
son
was
dead
.
Even
though
he
would
later
be
resurrected
,
he
was
at
this
moment
dead
indeed
,
the
expression
on
his
face
reflecting
what
he
had
gone
through
on
the
cross
.
In
his
sculpture
therefore
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
project
anything
of
what
Jesus
felt
for
his
mother
;
;
only
what
Mary
felt
for
her
son
.
Jesus'
inert
body
would
be
passive
,
his
eyes
closed
.
Mary
would
have
to
carry
the
human
communication
.
This
seemed
right
to
him
.
It
was
a
relief
to
shift
in
his
mind
to
technical
problems
.
Since
his
Christ
was
to
be
life
size
,
how
was
Mary
to
hold
him
on
her
lap
without
the
relationship
seeming
ungainly
?
?
His
Mary
would
be
slender
of
limb
and
delicate
of
proportion
,
yet
she
must
hold
this
full-grown
man
as
securely
and
convincingly
as
she
would
a
child
.
There
was
only
one
way
to
accomplish
this
:
by
design
,
by
drawing
diagrams
and
sketches
in
which
he
probed
the
remotest
corner
of
his
mind
for
creative
ideas
to
carry
his
concept
.
He
started
by
making
free
sketches
to
loosen
up
his
thinking
so
that
images
would
appear
on
paper
.
Visually
,
these
approximated
what
he
was
feeling
within
himself
.
At
the
same
time
he
started
walking
the
streets
,
peering
at
the
people
passing
or
shopping
at
the
stalls
,
storing
up
fresh
impressions
of
what
they
looked
like
,
how
they
moved
.
In
particular
he
sought
the
gentle
,
sweet-faced
nuns
,
with
head
coverings
and
veils
coming
to
the
middle
of
their
foreheads
,
remembering
their
expressions
until
he
reached
home
and
set
them
down
on
paper
.
Discovering
that
draperies
could
be
designed
to
serve
structural
purposes
,
he
began
a
study
of
the
anatomy
of
folds
.
He
improvised
as
he
went
along
,
completing
a
life-size
clay
figure
,
then
bought
yards
of
an
inexpensive
material
from
a
draper
,
wet
the
lightweight
cloth
in
a
basin
and
covered
it
over
with
clay
that
Argiento
brought
from
the
bank
of
the
Tiber
,
to
the
consistency
of
thick
mud
.
No
fold
could
be
accidental
,
each
turn
of
the
drapery
had
to
serve
organically
,
to
cover
the
Madonna's
slender
legs
and
feet
so
that
they
would
give
substantive
support
to
Christ's
body
,
to
intensify
her
inner
turmoil
.
When
the
cloth
dried
and
stiffened
,
he
saw
what
adjustments
had
to
be
made
.
``
So
that's
sculpture
''
,
commented
Argiento
wryly
,
when
he
had
sluiced
down
the
floor
for
a
week
,
``
making
mud
pies
''
.
Michelangelo
grinned
.
``
See
,
Argiento
,
if
you
control
the
way
these
folds
are
bunched
,
like
this
,
or
made
to
flow
,
you
can
enrich
the
body
attitudes
.
They
can
have
as
much
tactile
appeal
as
flesh
and
bone
''
.
He
went
into
the
Jewish
quarter
,
wanting
to
draw
Hebraic
faces
so
that
he
could
reach
a
visual
understanding
of
how
Christ
might
have
looked
.
The
Jewish
section
was
in
Trastevere
,
near
the
Tiber
at
the
church
of
San
Francesco
a
Ripa
.
The
colony
had
been
small
until
the
Spanish
Inquisition
of
1492
drove
many
Jews
into
Rome
.
Here
,
for
the
most
part
,
they
were
well
treated
,
as
a
``
reminder
of
the
Old
Testament
heritage
of
Christianity
''
;
;
many
of
their
gifted
members
were
prominent
in
the
Vatican
as
physicians
,
musicians
,
bankers
.
The
men
did
not
object
to
his
sketching
them
while
they
went
about
their
work
,
but
no
one
could
be
persuaded
to
come
to
his
studio
to
pose
.
He
was
told
to
ask
for
Rabbi
Melzi
at
the
synagogue
on
Saturday
afternoon
.
Michelangelo
found
the
rabbi
in
the
room
of
study
,
a
gentle
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
luminous
grey
eyes
,
robed
in
black
gabardine
with
a
skullcap
on
his
head
.
He
was
reading
from
the
Talmud
with
a
group
of
men
from
his
congregation
.
When
Michelangelo
explained
why
he
had
come
,
Rabbi
Melzi
replied
gravely
:
``
The
Bible
forbids
us
to
bow
down
to
or
to
make
graven
images
.
That
is
why
our
creative
people
give
their
time
to
literature
,
not
to
painting
or
sculpture
''
.
``
But
,
Rabbi
Melzi
,
you
don't
object
to
others
creating
works
of
art
''
?
?
``
Not
at
all
.
Each
religion
has
its
own
tenets
''
.
``
I
am
carving
a
Pieta
from
white
Carrara
marble
.
I
wish
to
make
Jesus
an
authentic
Jew
.
I
cannot
accomplish
this
if
you
will
not
help
me
''
.
The
rabbi
said
thoughtfully
,
``
I
would
not
want
my
people
to
get
in
trouble
with
the
Church
''
.
``
I
am
working
for
the
Cardinal
of
San
Dionigi
.
I'm
sure
he
would
approve
''
.
``
What
kind
of
models
would
you
prefer
''
?
?
``
Workmen
.
In
their
mid-thirties
.
Not
bulky
laborers
,
but
sinewy
men
.
With
intelligence
.
And
sensitivity
''
.
Rabbi
Melzi
smiled
at
him
with
infinitely
old
but
merry
eyes
.
``
Leave
me
your
address
.
I
will
send
you
the
best
the
quarter
has
to
offer
''
.
Michelangelo
hurried
to
Sangallo's
solitary
bachelor
room
with
his
sketches
,
asked
the
architect
to
design
a
stand
which
would
simulate
the
seated
Madonna
.
Sangallo
studied
the
drawings
and
improvised
a
trestle
couch
.
Michelangelo
bought
some
scrap
lumber
.
Together
he
and
Argiento
built
the
stand
,
covering
it
with
blankets
.
His
first
model
arrived
at
dusk
.
He
hesitated
for
a
moment
when
Michelangelo
asked
him
to
disrobe
,
so
Michelangelo
gave
him
a
piece
of
toweling
to
wrap
around
his
loins
,
led
him
to
the
kitchen
to
take
off
his
clothes
.
He
then
draped
him
over
the
rough
stand
,
explained
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
recently
dead
,
and
was
being
held
on
his
mother's
lap
.
The
model
quite
plainly
thought
Michelangelo
crazy
;
;
only
the
instructions
from
his
rabbi
kept
him
from
bolting
.
But
at
the
end
of
the
sitting
,
when
Michelangelo
showed
him
the
quick
,
free
drawings
,
with
the
mother
roughed
in
,
holding
her
son
,
the
model
grasped
what
Michelangelo
was
after
,
and
promised
to
speak
to
his
friends
.
He
worked
for
two
hours
a
day
with
each
model
sent
by
the
rabbi
.
Mary
presented
quite
a
different
problem
.
Though
this
sculpture
must
take
place
thirty-three
years
after
her
moment
of
decision
,
he
could
not
conceive
of
her
as
a
woman
in
her
mid-fifties
,
old
,
wrinkled
,
broken
in
body
and
face
by
labor
or
worry
.
His
image
of
the
Virgin
had
always
been
that
of
a
young
woman
,
even
as
had
his
memory
of
his
mother
.
Jacopo
Galli
introduced
him
into
several
Roman
homes
.
Here
he
sketched
,
sitting
in
their
flowing
gowns
of
linen
and
silk
,
young
girls
not
yet
twenty
,
some
about
to
be
married
,
some
married
a
year
or
two
.
Since
the
Santo
Spirito
hospital
had
taken
only
men
,
he
had
had
no
experience
in
the
study
of
female
anatomy
;
;
but
he
had
sketched
the
women
of
Tuscany
in
their
fields
and
homes
.
He
was
able
to
discern
the
body
lines
of
the
Roman
women
under
their
robes
.
He
spent
concentrated
weeks
putting
his
two
figures
together
:
a
Mary
who
would
be
young
and
sensitive
,
yet
strong
enough
to
hold
her
son
on
her
lap
;
;
and
a
Jesus
who
,
though
lean
,
was
strong
even
in
death
a
look
he
remembered
well
from
his
experience
in
the
dead
room
of
Santo
Spirito
.
He
drew
toward
the
composite
design
from
his
meticulously
accurate
memory
,
without
need
to
consult
his
sketches
.
Soon
he
was
ready
to
go
into
a
three-dimensional
figure
in
clay
.
Here
he
would
have
free
expression
because
the
material
could
be
moved
to
distort
forms
.
When
he
wanted
to
emphasize
,
or
get
greater
intensity
,
he
added
or
subtracted
clay
.
Next
he
turned
to
wax
because
there
was
a
similarity
of
wax
to
marble
in
tactile
quality
and
translucence
.
He
respected
each
of
these
approach
techniques
,
and
kept
them
in
character
:
his
quill
drawings
had
a
scratchiness
,
suggesting
skin
texture
;
;
the
clay
he
used
plastically
to
suggest
soft
moving
flesh
,
as
in
an
abdomen
,
in
a
reclining
torso
;
;
the
wax
he
smoothed
over
to
give
the
body
surface
an
elastic
pull
.
Yet
he
never
allowed
these
models
to
become
fixed
in
his
mind
;
;
they
remained
rough
starting
points
.
When
carving
he
was
charged
with
spontaneous
energy
;
;
too
careful
or
detailed
studies
in
clay
and
wax
would
have
glued
him
down
to
a
mere
enlarging
of
his
model
.
The
true
surge
had
to
be
inside
the
marble
itself
.
Drawing
and
models
were
his
thinking
.
Carving
was
action
.

.
The
arrangement
with
Argiento
was
working
well
,
except
that
sometimes
Michelangelo
could
not
figure
who
was
master
and
who
apprentice
.
Argiento
had
been
trained
so
rigorously
by
the
Jesuits
that
Michelangelo
was
unable
to
change
his
habits
:
up
before
dawn
to
scrub
the
floors
,
whether
they
were
dirty
or
not
;
;
water
boiling
on
the
fire
for
washing
laundry
every
day
,
the
pots
scoured
with
river
sand
after
each
meal
.
``
Argiento
,
this
is
senseless
''
,
he
complained
,
not
liking
to
work
on
the
wet
floors
,
particularly
in
cold
weather
.
``
You're
too
clean
.
Scrub
the
studio
once
a
week
.
That's
enough
''
.
``
No
''
,
said
Argiento
stolidly
.
``
Every
day
.
Before
dawn
.
I
was
taught
''
.
``
And
God
help
anyone
who
tries
to
unteach
you
''
!
!
Grumbled
Michelangelo
;
;
yet
he
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
grumble
about
,
for
Argiento
made
few
demands
on
him
.
The
boy
was
becoming
acquainted
with
the
contadini
families
that
brought
produce
into
Rome
.
On
Sundays
he
would
walk
miles
into
the
campagna
to
visit
with
them
,
and
in
particular
to
see
their
horses
.
The
one
thing
he
missed
from
his
farm
in
the
Po
Valley
was
the
animals
;
;
frequently
he
would
take
his
leave
of
Michelangelo
by
announcing
:
``
Today
I
go
see
the
horses
''
.
It
took
a
piece
of
bad
luck
to
show
Michelangelo
that
the
boy
was
devoted
to
him
.
He
was
crouched
over
his
anvil
in
the
courtyard
getting
his
chisels
into
trim
,
when
a
splinter
of
steel
flew
into
his
eye
and
imbedded
itself
in
his
pupil
.
He
stumbled
into
the
house
,
eyes
burning
like
fire
.
Argiento
made
him
lie
down
on
the
bed
,
brought
a
pan
of
hot
water
,
dipped
some
clean
white
linen
cloth
and
applied
it
to
extract
the
splinter
.
Though
the
pain
was
considerable
Michelangelo
was
not
too
concerned
.
He
assumed
he
could
blink
the
splinter
out
.
But
it
would
not
come
.
Argiento
never
left
his
side
,
keeping
the
water
boiled
,
applying
hot
compresses
throughout
the
night
.
By
the
second
day
Michelangelo
began
to
worry
;
;
and
by
the
second
night
he
was
in
a
state
of
panic
:
he
could
see
nothing
out
of
the
afflicted
eye
.
At
dawn
Argiento
went
to
Jacopo
Galli
.
Galli
arrived
with
his
family
surgeon
,
Maestro
Lippi
.
The
surgeon
carried
a
cage
of
live
pigeons
.
He
told
Argiento
to
take
a
bird
out
of
the
cage
,
cut
a
large
vein
under
its
wing
,
let
the
blood
gush
into
Michelangelo's
injured
eye
.
The
surgeon
came
back
at
dusk
,
cut
the
vein
of
a
second
pigeon
,
again
washed
out
the
eye
.
Beth
was
very
still
and
her
breath
came
in
small
jerking
gasps
.
The
thin
legs
twitched
convulsively
once
,
then
Kate
felt
the
little
body
stiffening
in
her
arms
and
heard
one
strangled
sound
.
The
scant
flesh
grew
cool
beneath
her
frantic
hands
.
The
child
was
gone
.
When
Juanita
awoke
,
Kate
was
still
rocking
the
dead
child
,
still
crooning
in
disbelief
,
``
No
,
no
,
oh
,
no
!
!
''
They
put
Kate
to
bed
and
wired
Jonathan
and
sent
for
the
young
Presbyterian
minister
.
He
sat
beside
Kate's
bed
with
the
others
throughout
the
morning
,
talking
,
talking
of
God's
will
,
while
Kate
lay
staring
angrily
at
him
.
When
he
told
her
God
had
called
the
child
to
Him
,
she
rejected
his
words
rebelliously
.
Few
of
the
neighbors
came
,
but
Mrs.
Tussle
came
,
called
by
tragedy
.
``
It
always
comes
in
threes
''
,
she
sighed
heavily
.
``
Trouble
never
comes
but
in
threes
''
.
They
held
the
funeral
the
next
morning
from
the
crossroads
church
and
buried
the
little
box
in
the
quiet
family
plot
.
Kate
moved
through
all
the
preparations
and
services
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
.
She
would
not
accept
the
death
of
such
a
little
child
.
``
God
called
her
to
Him
''
,
the
minister
had
said
.
God
would
not
do
that
,
Kate
thought
stubbornly
.
Jonathan's
letter
came
,
as
she
knew
it
would
,
and
he
had
accepted
their
child's
death
as
another
judgment
from
God
against
both
Kate
and
himself
.
In
blind
panic
of
grief
she
accepted
Jonathan's
dictum
,
and
believed
in
her
desperation
that
she
had
been
cursed
by
God
.
She
held
Jonathan's
letter
,
his
words
burning
like
a
brand
,
and
knew
suddenly
that
the
bonds
between
them
were
severed
.
She
had
nothing
left
but
her
duty
to
his
land
and
his
son
.
Joel
came
and
sat
mutely
with
her
,
sharing
her
pain
and
anguish
,
averting
his
eyes
from
the
ice
packs
on
her
bosom
.
Juanita
and
Mrs.
Tussle
kept
Kate
in
bed
a
week
until
her
milk
dried
.
When
she
returned
to
life
in
the
big
house
she
felt
shriveled
of
all
emotion
save
dedication
to
duty
.
She
disciplined
herself
daily
to
do
what
must
be
done
.
She
had
even
steeled
herself
to
keep
Juanita
upstairs
in
the
nurse's
room
off
the
empty
nursery
,
although
the
girl
tried
to
insist
on
moving
back
to
the
quarters
to
spare
Kate
remembrance
of
the
baby's
death
.
Juanita
drooped
about
the
place
,
wearing
a
haunted
,
brooding
look
,
which
Kate
attributed
to
the
baby's
death
,
until
the
day
a
letter
came
for
her
addressed
to
``
Miss
Juanita
Fitzroy
''
,
bearing
a
Grafton
postmark
.
Seeing
the
slanting
hand
,
Kate
knew
uneasily
that
it
was
from
the
Yankee
colonel
.
The
Federal
forces
had
taken
Parkersburg
and
Grafton
from
the
Rebels
and
were
moving
to
take
all
the
mountains
.
Kate
tried
to
contain
her
curiosity
and
foreboding
at
what
the
letter
portended
,
at
what
involvement
existed
for
Juanita
.
Uncle
Randolph
and
Joel
had
replanted
the
bottom
lands
with
difficulty
,
for
more
of
the
slaves
,
including
Annie
,
had
sneaked
off
when
the
soldiers
broke
camp
.
Joel
worked
like
a
field
hand
in
the
afternoons
after
school
.
He
had
been
at
lessons
in
the
schoolhouse
since
they
returned
from
Harpers
Ferry
.
Kate
felt
she
had
deserted
the
boy
in
her
own
loss
.
She
loved
him
and
missed
his
company
.
Uncle
Randolph
had
been
riding
out
every
evening
on
some
secret
business
of
his
own
.
What
it
was
Kate
could
not
fathom
.
He
claimed
to
be
visiting
the
waterfront
saloon
at
the
crossroads
to
play
cards
and
drink
with
his
cronies
,
but
Kate
had
not
smelled
brandy
on
him
since
Mrs.
Lattimer's
funeral
.
Joel
knew
what
he
was
about
,
however
.
``
You're
gonna
get
caught
''
,
she
heard
Joel
say
to
Uncle
Randolph
by
the
pump
one
morning
.
``
Not
this
old
fox
''
,
chuckled
Uncle
Randolph
.
``
Everybody
knows
I'm
just
a
harmless
,
deaf
old
man
who
takes
to
drink
.
I
aim
to
keep
a
little
whisky
still
back
in
the
ridge
for
my
pleasure
''
.
``
Whiskey
still
,
my
foot
''
,
said
Joel
.
``
You're
back
there
riding
with
the
guerrillas
,
the
Moccasin
Rangers
''
.
``
Hush
''
,
said
Uncle
Randolph
,
smiling
,
``
or
I'll
give
you
another
black
eye
''
.
He
patted
the
eye
Joel
had
had
blackened
in
a
fight
over
being
Rebel
at
the
crossroads
some
days
back
.
Kate
had
no
idea
what
they
were
talking
of
,
although
she
had
seen
the
blue
lights
and
strange
fires
burning
and
winking
on
the
ridges
at
night
,
had
heard
horsemen
on
the
River
Road
and
hill
trails
through
the
nights
till
dawn
.
Stranger
,
Uncle
Randolph
began
riding
home
nights
with
a
jug
strapped
to
his
saddle
,
drunkenly
singing
``
Old
Dan
Tucker
''
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
Hearing
his
voice
ring
raucously
up
from
the
road
,
Kate
would
await
him
anxiously
and
watch
perplexed
as
he
walked
into
the
house
,
cold
sober
.
What
he
was
about
became
clear
to
her
with
the
circulation
of
another
broadside
proclamation
by
General
McClellan
,
threatening
reprisals
against
Rebel
guerrillas
.
She
was
taken
up
in
worry
for
the
reckless
old
man
.
Kate
drew
more
and
more
on
her
affection
for
Joel
through
the
hot
days
of
summer
work
.
She
had
taken
him
out
of
the
schoolhouse
and
closed
the
school
for
the
summer
,
after
she
saw
Miss
Snow
crack
Joel
across
the
face
with
a
ruler
for
letting
a
snake
loose
in
the
schoolroom
.
Kate
had
walked
past
the
school
on
her
morning
chores
and
had
seen
the
whole
incident
,
had
seen
Joel's
burning
humiliation
before
Miss
Snow's
cold
,
bespectacled
wrath
.
He
had
the
hardest
pains
of
growing
before
him
now
,
as
he
approached
twelve
.
These
would
be
his
hardest
years
,
she
knew
,
and
he
missed
his
father
desperately
.
She
tried
to
find
some
way
to
draw
him
out
,
to
help
him
.
Whenever
she
found
time
,
she
went
blackberry
picking
with
him
,
and
they
would
come
home
together
,
mouths
purple
,
arms
and
faces
scratched
,
tired
enough
to
forget
grief
for
another
day
.
He
tended
the
new
colts
Beau
had
sired
.
He
helped
Kate
and
Juanita
enlarge
the
flower
garden
in
the
side
yard
,
where
they
sometimes
sat
in
the
still
evenings
watching
the
last
fat
bees
working
against
the
summer's
purple
dusk
.
No
one
went
much
to
the
crossroads
now
except
Uncle
Randolph
.
They
stayed
in
their
own
world
on
the
bluff
,
waiting
for
letters
and
the
peddler
,
bringing
the
news
.
Jonathan
wrote
grimly
of
the
destruction
of
Harpers
Ferry
before
they
abandoned
it
;
;
of
their
first
engagement
at
Falling
Waters
after
Old
Jack's
First
Brigade
had
destroyed
all
the
rolling
stock
of
the
B
&
O
Railroad
.
The
men
were
restive
,
he
wrote
,
ready
to
take
the
battle
to
the
enemy
as
Jackson
wished
.
The
peddler
came
bawling
his
wares
and
told
them
of
the
convention
in
Wheeling
,
Which
had
formed
a
new
state
government
by
declaring
the
government
at
Richmond
in
the
east
illegal
because
they
were
traitors
.
Dangling
his
gaudy
trinkets
before
them
,
he
told
of
the
Rebel
losses
in
the
mountains
,
at
Cheat
and
Rich
mountains
both
,
and
the
Federal
march
on
Beverly
.
``
Cleaned
all
them
Rebs
out'n
the
hills
,
they
did
!
!
They
won't
never
git
over
inter
loyal
western
Virginia
,
them
traitors
!
!
The
Federals
is
making
everybody
take
the
oath
of
loyalty
around
these
parts
too
''
,
he
crowed
.
After
he
had
gone
,
Kate
asked
Uncle
Randolph
proudly
,
``
Would
you
take
their
oath
''
?
?
And
the
old
man
had
given
a
sly
and
wicked
laugh
and
said
,
``
Hell
,
yes
!
!
I
think
I've
taken
it
about
fifty
times
already
''
!
!
Winking
at
Joel's
look
of
shock
.
Her
mother
wrote
Kate
of
her
grief
at
the
death
of
Kate's
baby
and
at
Jonathan's
decision
to
go
with
the
South
``
And
,
dear
Kate
''
,
she
wrote
,
``
poor
Dr.
Breckenridge's
son
Robert
is
now
organizing
a
militia
company
to
go
South
,
to
his
good
father's
sorrow
.
Maj.
Anderson
of
Fort
Sumter
is
home
and
recruiting
volunteers
for
the
U.S.
Army
.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
state
legislature
voted
us
neutral
,
John
Hunt
Morgan
is
openly
flying
the
Confederate
flag
over
his
woolen
factory
''
!
!
Rumor
of
a
big
battle
spread
like
a
grassfire
up
the
valley
.
Accounts
were
garbled
at
the
telegraph
office
when
they
sent
old
George
down
to
Parkersburg
for
the
news
.
``
All
dey
know
down
dere
is
it
were
at
Manassas
Junction
and
it
were
a
big
fight
''
,
the
old
man
told
them
.
In
the
next
few
days
they
had
cause
to
rejoice
.
It
had
been
a
big
battle
,
and
the
Confederate
forces
had
won
.
Jonathan
and
Ben
were
not
on
the
lists
of
the
dead
or
on
that
of
the
missing
.
Kate
and
Mrs.
Tussle
waited
for
letters
anxiously
.
Joel
went
to
the
crest
of
a
hill
behind
the
house
and
lit
an
enormous
victory
bonfire
to
celebrate
.
When
Kate
hurried
in
alarm
to
tell
him
to
put
it
out
,
she
saw
other
dots
of
flames
among
the
western
Virginia
hills
from
the
few
scattered
fires
of
the
faithful
.
They
all
prayed
now
that
the
North
would
realize
that
peace
must
come
,
for
Virginia
had
defended
her
land
victoriously
.
The
week
after
Manassas
the
sound
of
horses
in
the
yard
brought
Kate
up
in
shock
from
an
afternoon's
rest
when
she
saw
the
Federal
soldiers
from
her
upstairs
window
.
They
had
already
lost
most
of
their
corn
,
she
thought
.
Were
they
to
be
insulted
again
because
of
the
South's
great
victory
?
?
She
remembered
McClellan's
last
proclamation
as
she
hurried
fearfully
down
the
stairs
.
At
the
landing
she
saw
Juanita
,
her
face
flushed
pink
with
excitement
,
run
down
the
hall
from
the
kitchen
to
the
front
door
.
Juanita
stopped
just
inside
the
open
door
,
her
hand
to
her
mouth
.
As
Kate
came
swiftly
down
the
stairs
to
the
hall
she
saw
Colonel
Marsh
framed
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
set
in
the
same
vulnerable
look
Juanita
wore
.
Kate
greeted
him
gravely
,
uneasy
with
misgivings
at
his
visit
.
``
What
brings
you
here
again
,
Colonel
Marsh
''
?
?
She
asked
,
taking
him
and
Juanita
into
the
parlor
where
the
shutters
were
closed
against
the
afternoon
sun
.
``
I
stopped
to
say
goodbye
,
Mrs.
Lattimer
,
and
to
tell
you
how
sorry
I
was
to
hear
about
your
baby
.
I
wish
our
doctor
could
have
saved
her
''
.
``
It
was
a
terrible
loss
to
me
''
,
said
Kate
quietly
,
feeling
the
pain
twist
again
at
the
mention
,
knowing
now
that
Juanita
must
have
written
to
him
at
Grafton
.
``
Where
will
you
go
now
that
you're
leaving
Parkersburg
''
?
?
She
asked
him
,
seeing
Juanita's
eyes
grow
bleak
.
``
As
you
know
,
General
McClellan
has
been
occupying
Beverly
.
He
has
notified
me
that
he
has
orders
to
go
to
Washington
to
take
over
the
Army
of
the
Potomac
.
I
am
to
go
to
Washington
to
serve
with
him
''
.
``
When
are
you
to
leave
''
?
?
Kate
asked
,
watching
them
both
now
anxiously
.
Their
eyes
betrayed
too
much
of
their
emotions
,
she
thought
sadly
.
``
Tomorrow
.
Would
you
permit
Juanita
to
walk
about
the
grounds
with
me
for
a
short
spell
,
Mrs.
Lattimer
''
?
?
``
Stay
here
in
the
parlor
where
it's
cool
''
,
she
said
,
trying
to
be
calm
.
It
would
be
better
for
Joel
and
Uncle
Randolph
and
Mrs.
Tussle
not
to
see
them
.
Kate
went
back
and
reminded
the
kitchen
women
of
the
supper
preparations
.
Then
she
took
iced
lemonade
to
Marsh's
young
aide
where
he
sat
in
the
cool
of
the
big
trees
around
the
flower
garden
.
When
Marsh
called
to
his
aide
and
the
pair
rode
off
down
the
River
Road
where
the
gentians
burned
blue
,
Juanita
was
shaken
and
trying
not
to
cry
.
She
sought
Kate
out
upstairs
,
her
lips
trembling
.
``
He
wants
me
to
go
with
him
tomorrow
''
,
she
told
Kate
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
''
?
?
Kate
asked
,
uneasy
at
the
gravity
of
the
girl's
dilemma
.
``
I
could
go
with
him
.
He
knows
me
as
your
niece
,
which
,
of
course
,
I
am
.
But
I
am
a
slave
!
!
You
own
me
.
It's
your
decision
''
,
said
Juanita
,
holding
her
face
very
still
,
trying
to
contain
the
bitterness
of
her
voice
as
she
enunciated
her
words
too
distinctly
.
``
No
,
the
decision
is
yours
.
I
have
held
your
papers
of
manumission
since
I
married
Mr.
Lattimer
''
.
The
red
glow
from
the
cove
had
died
out
of
the
sky
.
The
two
in
the
bed
knew
each
other
as
old
people
know
the
partners
with
whom
they
have
shared
the
same
bed
for
many
years
,
and
they
needed
to
say
no
more
.
The
things
left
unsaid
they
both
felt
deeply
,
and
with
a
sigh
they
fell
back
on
the
well-stuffed
pillows
.
Anita
put
out
the
remaining
candles
with
a
long
snuffer
,
and
in
the
smell
of
scented
candlewick
,
the
comforting
awareness
of
each
other's
bodies
,
the
retained
pattern
of
dancers
and
guests
remembered
,
their
minds
grew
numb
and
then
empty
of
images
.
They
slept
--
Mynheer
with
a
marvelously
high-pitched
snoring
,
the
damn
seahorse
ivory
teeth
watching
him
from
a
bedside
table
.
In
the
ballroom
below
,
the
dark
had
given
way
to
moonlight
coming
in
through
the
bank
of
French
windows
.
It
was
a
delayed
moon
,
but
now
the
sky
had
cleared
of
scudding
black
and
the
stars
sugared
the
silver-gray
sky
.
Martha
Schuyler
,
old
,
slow
,
careful
of
foot
,
came
down
the
great
staircase
,
dressed
in
her
best
lace-drawn
black
silk
,
her
jeweled
shoe
buckles
held
forward
.
``
Well
,
I'm
here
at
last
''
,
she
said
,
addressing
the
old
portraits
on
the
walls
.
``
I
don't
hear
the
music
.
I
am
getting
deaf
,
I
must
admit
it
''
.
She
came
to
the
ballroom
and
stood
on
the
two
carpeted
steps
that
led
down
to
it
.
``
Where
is
everyone
?
?
I
say
,
where
is
everyone
?
?
Peter
,
you
lummox
,
you've
forgot
to
order
the
musicians
''
.
She
stood
there
,
a
large
old
woman
,
smiling
at
the
things
she
would
say
to
him
in
the
morning
,
this
big
foolish
baby
of
a
son
.
There
were
times
now
,
like
this
,
when
she
lost
control
of
the
time
count
and
moved
freely
back
and
forth
into
three
generations
.
Was
it
a
birthday
ball
?
?
When
Peter
had
reached
his
majority
at
eighteen
?
?
Or
was
it
her
own
first
ball
as
mistress
of
this
big
house
,
a
Van
Rensselaer
bride
from
way
upstate
near
Albany
,
from
Rensselaerwyck
.
And
this
handsome
booby
,
staring
and
sweating
,
was
he
her
bridegroom
?
?
Martha
picked
up
the
hem
of
her
gown
and
with
eyes
closed
she
slowly
began
to
dance
a
stately
minuet
around
the
ballroom
.
David
Cortlandt
was
tired
beyond
almost
the
limits
of
his
flesh
.
He
had
ridden
hard
from
Boston
,
and
he
was
not
used
to
horseback
.
Now
,
driving
the
horse
and
sulky
borrowed
from
Mynheer
Schuyler
,
he
felt
as
if
every
bone
was
topped
by
burning
oil
and
that
every
muscle
was
ready
to
dissolve
into
jelly
and
leave
his
big
body
helpless
and
unable
to
move
.
The
road
leading
south
along
the
river
was
shaded
with
old
trees
,
and
in
the
moonlight
the
silvery
landscape
was
like
a
setting
for
trolls
and
wood
gods
rather
than
the
Hudson
River
Valley
of
his
boyhood
memories
.
He
slapped
the
reins
on
the
back
of
the
powerful
gray
horse
and
held
on
as
the
sulky's
wheels
hit
a
pothole
and
came
out
with
a
jolt
and
went
on
.
He
would
cross
to
Manhattan
,
to
Harlem
Heights
,
before
morning
.
There
a
certain
farmhouse
was
a
station
for
the
Sons
of
Liberty
.
He
would
send
on
by
trusted
messenger
the
dispatches
with
their
electrifying
news
.
And
he
would
sleep
,
sleep
,
and
never
think
of
roads
and
horses'
sore
haunches
,
of
colonial
wars
.
Strange
how
everything
here
fitted
back
into
his
life
,
even
if
he
had
been
away
so
long
.
Mynheer
,
Sir
Francis
,
the
valley
society
,
the
very
smell
of
the
river
on
his
right
purling
along
to
the
bay
past
fish
weirs
and
rocks
,
and
ahead
the
sleepy
ribbon
of
moon-drenched
road
.
A
mist
was
walking
on
the
water
,
white
as
cotton
,
but
with
a
blending
and
merging
grace
.
Ahead
there
was
a
stirring
of
sudden
movement
at
a
crossroads
.
David
reached
for
the
pair
of
pistols
in
the
saddlebags
at
his
feet
.
He
pulled
out
one
of
them
and
cocked
it
.
A
strange
wood
creature
came
floating
up
from
a
patch
of
berry
bushes
.
It
was
a
grotesque
hen
,
five
or
six
feet
tall
.
It
had
the
features
of
a
man
bewhiskered
by
clumps
of
loose
feathers
.
It
ran
,
this
apocalyptic
beast
,
on
two
thin
legs
,
and
its
wings
--
were
they
feathered
arms
?
?
--
flapped
as
it
ran
.
Its
groin
was
bloody
.
Black
strips
of
skin
hung
from
it
.
The
horse
shied
at
the
dreadful
thing
and
flared
its
nostrils
.
David
took
a
firm
hand
with
it
.
The
creature
in
feathers
looked
around
and
David
saw
the
mad
eyes
,
glazed
with
an
insane
fear
.
The
ungainly
bird
thing
ran
away
,
and
to
David
its
croaking
sounded
like
the
crowing
of
a
tormented
rooster
.
Then
it
was
gone
.
He
drove
on
,
wary
and
shaken
.
The
Sons
were
out
tonight
.
Chapter
10
New
York
lay
bleaching
in
the
summer
sun
,
and
the
morning
fish
hawk
,
flying
in
the
heated
air
,
saw
below
him
the
long
triangular
wedge
of
Manhattan
Island
.
It
was
thickly
settled
by
fifteen
thousand
citizens
and
laid
out
into
pig-infested
streets
,
mostly
around
the
Battery
,
going
bravely
north
to
Wall
Street
,
but
giving
up
and
becoming
fields
and
farms
in
the
region
of
Harlem
Heights
.
From
there
it
looked
across
at
Westchester
County
and
the
Hudson
River
where
the
manor
houses
,
estates
,
and
big
farms
of
the
original
(
non-Indian
)
landowners
began
.
On
the
east
side
of
the
island
of
Manhattan
the
indifferent
hawk
knew
the
East
River
that
connected
New
York
Bay
with
Long
Island
Sound
.
On
the
western
tip
of
Long
Island
protruded
Brooklyn
Heights
.
It
commanded
a
view
over
Manhattan
and
the
harbor
.
A
fringe
of
housing
and
gardens
bearded
the
top
of
the
heights
,
and
behind
it
were
sandy
roads
leading
past
farms
and
hayfields
.
Husbandry
was
bounded
by
snake-rail
fences
,
and
there
were
grazing
cattle
.
On
the
shores
north
and
south
,
the
fishers
and
mooncursers
--
smugglers
--
lived
along
the
churning
Great
South
Bay
and
the
narrow
barrier
of
sand
,
Fire
Island
.
The
morning
hawk
,
hungry
for
any
eatable
,
killable
,
digestible
item
,
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ring
of
anchored
ships
that
lay
off
the
shores
in
the
bay
,
sheltered
by
the
Jersey
inlets
.
They
often
threw
tidbits
overboard
.
The
larger
ships
were
near
Paulus
Hook
,
already
being
called
,
by
a
few
,
Jersey
City
.
These
were
the
ships
of
His
Majesty's
Navy
,
herding
the
hulks
of
the
East
Indies
merchants
and
the
yachts
and
ketches
of
the
loyalists
.
The
news
of
battle
on
Breed's
Hill
had
already
seeped
through
,
and
New
York
itself
was
now
left
in
the
hands
of
the
local
Provincial
Congress
.
The
fish
hawk
,
his
wings
not
moving
,
circled
and
glided
lower
.
The
gilt
sterns
of
the
men-of-war
becoming
clearer
to
him
,
the
sides
of
the
wooden
sea
walls
alternately
painted
yellow
and
black
,
the
bronze
cannon
at
the
ports
.
The
captain's
gig
of
H.M.S.
Mercury
was
being
rowed
to
H.M.S.
Neptune
.
On
shore
``
the
freed
slaves
to
despotism
''
--
the
town
dwellers
--
watched
the
ships
and
waited
.
The
chevaux
de
frise
,
those
sharp
stakes
and
barriers
around
the
fort
at
the
Battery
,
pointed
to
a
conflict
between
the
town
and
sea
power
rolling
in
glassy
swells
as
the
tide
came
in
.
Across
the
bay
the
Palisades
were
heavy
in
green
timber
;
;
their
rock
paths
led
down
to
the
Hudson
.
Below
in
the
open
bay
facing
Manhattan
was
Staten
Island
,
gritty
with
clam
shells
and
mud
flats
behind
which
nested
farms
,
cattle
barns
,
and
berry
thickets
.
Along
Wappinger
Creek
in
Dutchess
County
,
past
the
white
church
at
Fishkill
,
past
Verplanck's
Point
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Hudson
,
to
the
white
salt-crusted
roads
of
the
Long
Island
Rockaways
there
was
a
watching
and
an
activity
of
preparing
for
something
explosive
to
happen
.
Today
,
tomorrow
,
six
months
,
even
perhaps
a
year
The
fish
hawk
flew
on
and
was
lost
from
sight
.
The
British
ships
rolled
at
anchor
,
sent
out
picket
boats
and
waited
for
orders
from
London
.
Waited
for
more
ships
,
more
lobster-backed
infantry
,
and
asked
what
was
to
be
done
with
a
war
of
rebellion
?
?
David
Cortlandt
,
having
slept
away
a
day
and
a
night
,
came
awake
in
a
plank
farmhouse
on
the
Harlem
River
near
Spuyten
Duyvil
.
He
looked
out
through
windowpanes
turned
a
faint
violet
by
sun
and
weather
,
looked
out
at
King's
Bridge
toward
Westchester
.
The
road
seemed
animated
with
a
few
more
wagons
than
usual
;
;
a
carriage
raising
up
the
choking
June
dust
,
and
beyond
,
in
a
meadow
,
a
local
militia
company
drilling
with
muskets
,
Kentuck'
rifles
,
every
kind
of
horse
pistol
,
old
sword
,
or
cutlass
.
The
wraith-like
events
of
the
last
few
days
flooded
David's
mind
and
he
rubbed
his
unshaved
chin
and
felt
again
the
ache
in
his
kidneys
caused
by
his
saddle
odyssey
from
Boston
.
Pensive
,
introspective
,
he
ached
.
He
had
sent
the
dispatches
downtown
to
the
proper
people
and
had
slept
.
Now
there
was
more
to
do
.
Orders
not
written
down
had
to
be
transmitted
to
the
local
provincial
government
.
He
scratched
his
mosquito-plagued
neck
.
From
the
saddlebags
,
hung
on
a
Hitchcock
chair
,
David
took
out
a
good
English
razor
,
a
present
from
John
Hunter
.
He
found
tepid
water
in
a
pitcher
and
a
last
bit
of
soap
,
and
he
lathered
his
face
and
stood
stropping
the
razor
on
his
broad
leather
belt
,
its
buckle
held
firm
by
a
knob
of
the
bedpost
.
He
hoped
he
was
free
of
self-deception
.
Here
he
was
,
suddenly
caught
up
in
the
delirium
of
a
war
,
in
the
spite
and
calumny
of
Whigs
and
Tories
.
There
would
be
great
need
soon
for
his
skill
as
surgeon
,
but
somehow
he
had
not
planned
to
use
his
knowledge
merely
for
war
.
David
Cortlandt
had
certain
psychic
intuitions
that
this
rebellion
was
not
wholly
what
it
appeared
on
the
surface
.
He
knew
that
many
were
using
it
for
their
own
ends
.
But
it
did
not
matter
.
He
stropped
the
razor
slowly
;
;
what
mattered
was
that
a
new
concept
of
Americans
was
being
born
.
That
some
men
did
not
want
it
he
could
understand
.
The
moral
aridity
of
merchants
made
them
loyal
usually
to
their
ledgers
.
Yet
some
,
like
Morris
Manderscheid
,
would
bankrupt
themselves
for
the
new
ideas
.
Unique
circumstances
would
test
us
all
,
he
decided
.
Injury
and
ingratitude
would
occur
.
No
doubt
John
Hancock
would
do
well
now
;
;
war
was
a
smugglers'
heaven
.
And
what
of
that
poor
tarred
and
feathered
wretch
he
had
seen
on
the
road
driving
down
from
Schuyler's
?
?
Things
like
that
would
increase
rather
than
be
done
away
with
.
One
had
to
believe
in
final
events
or
one
was
stranded
in
the
abyss
of
nothing
.
He
saw
with
John
Hunter
now
that
the
perfectability
of
man
was
a
dream
.
Life
was
a
short
play
of
tenebrous
shadows
.
David
began
to
shave
with
great
sweeping
strokes
.
Time
plays
an
essential
part
in
our
mortality
,
and
suddenly
for
no
reason
he
could
imagine
(
or
admit
)
the
image
of
Peg
laughing
filled
his
mind
--
so
desirable
,
so
lusty
,
so
full
of
nuances
of
pleasure
and
joy
.
He
drove
sensual
patterns
off
,
carefully
shaving
his
long
upper
lip
.
It
is
harder
,
he
muttered
,
to
meditate
on
man
(
or
woman
)
than
on
God
.
David
finished
shaving
,
washed
his
face
clean
of
lather
,
and
combed
and
retied
his
hair
.
He
was
proud
that
he
had
never
worn
a
wig
.
More
and
more
of
the
colonials
were
wearing
their
own
hair
and
not
using
powder
.
He
felt
cheerful
again
,
refreshed
;
;
presentable
in
his
wide-cut
brown
suit
,
the
well-made
riding
boots
.
It
is
so
easy
to
falsify
sentiment
.
In
the
meadow
below
,
militia
officers
shouted
at
their
men
and
on
King's
Bridge
two
boys
sat
fishing
.
