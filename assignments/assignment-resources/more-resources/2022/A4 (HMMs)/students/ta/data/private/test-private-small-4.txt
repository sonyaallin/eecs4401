The
world
awaits
Mr.
Khrushchev's
choice
of
alternatives
.
A
vote
for
educational
TV
The
Senate's
overwhelming
(
64-13
)
vote
to
support
locally
controlled
educational
TV
efforts
should
be
emulated
in
the
lower
house
.
Twice
previously
the
Senate
has
approved
measures
backing
ETV
and
the
House
has
let
them
die
.
But
this
year
prospects
may
be
better
.
The
House
communications
subcommittee
is
expected
to
report
out
a
good
bill
calling
for
the
states
to
match
federal
funds
.
This
year's
Senate
measure
would
provide
each
state
and
the
District
of
Columbia
with
$1,000,000
to
be
used
in
support
of
private
,
state
,
or
municipal
ETV
efforts
.
The
funds
would
be
used
for
equipment
,
not
for
land
,
buildings
,
or
operation
.
The
relatively
few
communities
that
have
educational
stations
have
found
them
of
considerable
value
.
But
,
lacking
money
from
commercial
sponsors
,
the
stations
have
had
difficulties
meeting
expenses
or
improving
their
service
.
Other
communities
--
the
ones
to
be
aided
most
by
the
Senate
bill
--
have
had
difficulty
starting
such
stations
because
of
the
high
initial
cost
of
equipment
.
A
good
man
departs
.
Goodby
,
Mr.
Sam
.
Sam
Rayburn
was
a
good
man
,
a
good
American
,
and
,
third
,
a
good
Democrat
.
He
was
all
of
these
rolled
into
one
sturdy
figure
;
;
Mr.
Speaker
,
Mr.
Sam
,
and
Mr.
Democrat
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
The
House
was
his
habitat
and
there
he
flourished
,
first
as
a
young
representative
,
then
as
a
forceful
committee
chairman
,
and
finally
in
the
post
for
which
he
seemed
intended
from
birth
,
Speaker
of
the
House
,
and
second
most
powerful
man
in
Washington
.
Mr.
Rayburn
was
not
an
easy
man
to
classify
or
to
label
.
He
was
no
flaming
liberal
,
yet
the
New
Deal
,
the
Fair
Deal
and
the
New
Frontier
needed
him
.
He
was
not
a
rear-looking
conservative
,
yet
partisans
of
that
persuasion
will
miss
him
as
much
as
any
.
Two
of
the
vital
qualities
demanded
of
a
politician
by
other
politicians
are
that
he
always
keep
a
confidence
and
that
he
keep
his
word
.
Sam
Rayburn
took
unnumbered
secrets
with
him
to
the
grave
,
for
he
was
never
loquacious
,
and
his
word
,
once
given
,
was
not
subject
to
retraction
.
