Meditations
from
a
fallout
shelter
Time
was
when
the
house
of
delegates
of
the
American
Bar
association
leaned
to
the
common
sense
side
.
But
the
internationalists
have
taken
over
the
governing
body
of
the
bar
,
and
when
the
lads
met
in
St.
Louis
,
it
was
not
to
grumble
about
the
humidity
but
to
vote
unanimously
that
the
United
Nations
was
scarcely
less
than
wonderful
,
despite
an
imperfection
here
and
there
.
It
was
,
the
brief
writers
decided
,
``
man's
best
hope
for
a
peaceful
and
law
abiding
world
''
.
Peace
,
it's
wonderful
,
and
``
world
law
''
,
it's
wonderful
,
too
,
and
shouldn't
we
get
an
international
covenant
extending
it
into
space
,
before
the
Russians
put
some
claim
jumper
on
the
moon
?
?
Meanwhile
,
in
Moscow
,
Khrushchev
was
adding
his
bit
to
the
march
of
world
law
by
promising
to
build
a
bomb
with
a
wallop
equal
to
100
million
tons
of
TNT
,
to
knock
sense
into
the
heads
of
those
backward
oafs
who
can't
see
the
justice
of
surrendering
West
Berlin
to
communism
.
A
nuclear
pacifier
of
these
dimensions
--
roughly
some
six
and
a
half
times
bigger
than
anything
the
United
States
has
triggered
experimentally
--
would
certainly
produce
a
bigger
bang
,
and
,
just
for
kicks
,
Khrushchev
might
use
it
to
propel
the
seminar
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
St.
Louis
to
the
moon
,
where
there
wouldn't
even
be
any
beer
to
drink
.
While
he
was
at
it
,
the
philosopher
of
the
Kremlin
contributed
an
additional
assist
to
the
rule
of
reason
by
bellowing
at
those
in
the
west
who
can't
appreciate
coexistence
thru
suicide
.
``
Fools
''
,
he
bayed
,
``
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
''
?
?
The
only
response
we
can
think
of
is
the
humble
one
that
at
least
we
aren't
playing
the
marimba
with
our
shoes
in
the
United
Nations
,
but
perhaps
the
heavy
domes
in
the
house
of
delegates
can
improve
on
this
feeble
effort
.
Another
evidence
of
the
spreading
rule
of
reason
was
provided
from
Mexico
City
with
the
daily
hijacking
of
an
American
plane
by
a
demented
Algerian
with
a
gun
.
The
craft
made
the
familiar
unwelcome
flight
to
Havana
,
where
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
Castro
rushed
to
the
airport
to
express
mortification
to
the
Colombian
foreign
minister
,
a
passenger
,
who
is
not
an
admirer
of
old
Ten
O'Clock
Shadow
.
