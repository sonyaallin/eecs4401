It
might
be
added
that
as
he
kept
his
word
so
he
expected
that
others
keep
theirs
.
The
demonstration
of
his
power
was
never
flamboyant
or
theatrical
.
His
leadership
was
not
for
audiences
.
A
growl
,
a
nod
,
was
usually
enough
.
When
it
was
not
,
one
of
the
great
dramas
of
Washington
would
be
presented
.
He
would
rise
in
the
well
of
the
House
,
his
chin
upon
his
chest
,
his
hands
gripping
the
side
of
a
desk
,
and
the
political
and
legislative
chatter
would
subside
into
silence
.
He
spoke
briefly
,
sensibly
,
to
the
point
and
without
oratorical
flourishes
.
He
made
good
,
plain
American
common
sense
and
the
House
usually
recognized
it
and
acted
upon
it
.
These
public
efforts
were
rare
because
Mr.
Rayburn
normally
did
his
counseling
,
persuading
and
educating
long
before
an
issue
reached
its
test
on
the
House
floor
.
He
expected
Democrats
to
do
their
duty
when
it
had
been
patiently
pointed
out
to
them
.
With
his
long
service
he
had
a
long
memory
,
an
excellent
thing
in
a
political
leader
.
He
was
,
of
course
,
in
the
House
for
a
very
long
time
.
There
are
only
two
men
remaining
in
Congress
who
,
with
Rayburn
,
voted
for
the
declaration
of
war
against
Germany
in
1917
.
To
almost
two
generations
of
Americans
it
must
have
seemed
as
though
the
existence
of
Mr.
Sam
coincided
with
that
of
the
House
.
And
it
was
the
House
he
loved
.
To
be
presiding
officer
of
it
was
the
end
of
his
desire
and
ambition
.
The
Senate
to
him
was
not
the
``
upper
body
''
and
he
corrected
those
who
said
he
served
``
under
''
the
president
.
He
served
``
with
''
him
.
Sound
the
roll
of
those
with
whom
he
served
and
who
preceded
him
in
death
.
Woodrow
Wilson
,
with
whom
he
began
his
years
in
Washington
,
Warren
G.
Harding
,
Calvin
Coolidge
,
FDR
,
with
whom
he
managed
a
social
revolution
.
And
those
still
with
us
,
Herbert
C.
Hoover
,
Harry
S.
Truman
,
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
and
John
F.
Kennedy
.
He
was
a
fighter
for
those
of
his
own
party
.
Mr.
Truman
has
only
to
recall
the
``
hopeless
''
campaign
of
1948
to
remember
what
a
loyal
partisan
he
was
and
the
first
experience
of
Mr.
Kennedy
with
Congress
would
have
been
sadder
than
it
was
had
not
Mr.
Sam
been
there
.
