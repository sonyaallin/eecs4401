To
have
one's
intentions
deliberately
or
unintentionally
misunderstood
is
always
a
waste
of
time
.
Until
our
Moscow
experience
,
I
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
prepare
any
argument
formally
or
informally
.
Artists
simply
do
not
talk
to
each
other
in
that
fashion
;
;
and
,
furthermore
,
I
could
not
presume
the
implication
that
I
spoke
for
American
artists
as
a
group
.
To
save
time
,
some
clarification
seemed
necessary
.
The
following
is
a
statement
read
to
a
large
and
friendly
group
of
your
fellow
artists
in
Leningrad
:
``
We
have
come
to
your
land
with
the
express
intention
of
understanding
and
respecting
your
ideas
and
your
ways
.
Our
presence
here
should
also
be
considered
further
,
sincere
evidence
of
the
attempts
by
our
people
and
their
chosen
government
to
seek
any
and
all
possible
ways
to
effect
closer
,
peaceful
ties
among
all
people
.
We
are
quite
convinced
that
one
of
the
main
hopes
for
the
future
depends
upon
the
informal
contacts
and
exchanges
of
ideas
between
individuals
.
In
spite
of
the
relatively
short
period
of
time
that
we
have
experienced
among
you
,
we
have
already
seen
many
indications
of
your
character
and
spirit
.
We
are
acutely
aware
that
yours
is
a
society
which
,
in
spite
of
several
wars
and
many
privations
,
has
developed
itself
into
one
of
the
foremost
nations
of
the
world
.
Your
past
history
is
resplendent
with
the
fruits
of
the
intellect
.
Your
present
history
is
equally
admirable
for
its
industrial
and
scientific
achievements
.
We
have
come
to
you
to
experience
something
of
your
way
of
life
while
also
attempting
to
acquaint
you
with
that
of
ours
.
While
we
,
as
American
artists
,
believe
deeply
in
the
universal
character
of
all
intellectual
activity
,
we
would
be
less
than
honest
with
you
,
or
ourselves
,
if
we
failed
to
state
a
specific
attitude
toward
our
own
society
as
well
as
the
international
community
as
a
whole
.
In
stating
this
position
,
we
should
like
to
make
it
clear
to
you
that
we
cannot
expect
artists
and
intellectuals
in
other
lands
to
share
our
opinion
in
every
respect
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
we
prize
the
diversity
among
our
own
people
so
much
that
we
will
not
presume
to
speak
for
all
other
American
artists
.
But
certainly
,
all
will
agree
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
knowledge
and
search
for
similarities
between
you
and
us
,
but
rather
the
thoughtful
exploration
and
acceptance
of
our
differences
which
may
lead
us
to
our
respective
and
desired
goals
with
a
minimum
of
misunderstanding
.
Like
yourselves
,
we
have
pride
and
love
for
our
country
.
To
many
of
us
,
this
is
a
land
to
which
we
or
our
parents
fled
from
totalitarian
terror
in
order
to
live
in
dignified
freedom
.
As
artists
we
feel
the
same
obligation
,
as
do
other
individuals
,
in
considering
ourselves
responsible
citizens
of
a
great
nation
.
The
Sane
Society
is
an
ambitious
work
.
Its
scope
is
as
broad
as
the
question
:
What
does
it
mean
to
live
in
modern
society
?
?
A
work
so
broad
,
even
when
it
is
directed
by
a
leading
idea
and
informed
by
a
moral
vision
,
must
necessarily
``
fail
''
.
Even
a
hasty
reader
will
easily
find
in
it
numerous
blind
spots
,
errors
of
fact
and
argument
,
important
exclusions
,
areas
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
,
undue
emphases
on
trivia
,
examples
of
broad
positions
supported
by
flimsy
evidence
,
and
the
like
.
Such
books
are
easy
prey
for
critics
.
Nor
need
the
critic
be
captious
.
A
careful
and
orderly
man
,
who
values
precision
and
a
kind
of
tough
intellectual
responsibility
,
might
easily
be
put
off
by
such
a
book
.
It
is
a
simple
matter
,
for
one
so
disposed
,
to
take
a
work
like
The
Sane
Society
and
shred
it
into
odds
and
ends
.
The
thing
can
be
made
to
look
like
the
cluttered
attic
of
a
large
and
vigorous
family
--
a
motley
jumble
of
discarded
objects
,
some
outworn
and
some
that
were
never
useful
,
some
once
whole
and
bright
but
now
chipped
and
tarnished
,
some
odd
pieces
whose
history
no
one
remembers
,
here
and
there
a
gem
,
everything
fascinating
because
it
suggests
some
part
of
the
human
condition
--
the
whole
adding
up
to
nothing
more
than
a
glimpse
into
the
disorderly
history
of
the
makers
and
users
.
That
could
be
easily
done
,
but
there
is
little
reason
in
it
.
It
would
come
down
to
saying
that
Fromm
paints
with
a
broad
brush
,
and
that
,
after
all
,
is
not
a
conclusion
one
must
work
toward
but
an
impression
he
has
from
the
outset
.
I
mention
these
features
of
the
book
because
they
are
inherent
in
the
book's
character
and
therefore
must
be
mentioned
.
It
would
be
superfluous
to
build
a
critique
around
them
.
There
are
more
substantial
criticisms
to
be
made
of
Fromm's
account
of
capitalist
civilization
.
It
is
worthwhile
to
recall
that
Fromm's
treatment
has
both
descriptive
and
normative
aspects
.
Since
I
have
already
discussed
his
moral
position
,
that
discussion
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
following
pages
,
which
will
focus
on
the
empirical
and
analytic
side
of
Fromm's
treatment
.
I
shall
first
indicate
a
couple
of
weaknesses
in
Fromm's
analysis
,
then
argue
that
,
granted
these
weaknesses
,
he
still
has
much
left
that
is
valuable
,
and
,
finally
,
raise
the
general
question
of
a
philosophical
versus
a
sociological
approach
to
the
question
of
alienation
.
Almost
no
empirical
work
has
been
done
on
the
problem
of
alienation
.
Despite
its
rather
long
intellectual
history
,
alienation
is
still
a
promising
hypothesis
and
not
a
verified
theory
.
The
idea
has
received
much
attention
in
philosophy
,
in
literature
,
and
in
a
few
works
of
general
social
criticism
,
such
as
The
Sane
Society
.
What
is
missing
is
work
that
would
answer
,
presumably
by
the
use
of
survey
methods
and
Guttman-type
attitude
scales
,
such
questions
as
these
:
What
are
the
components
of
the
feeling-state
described
as
alienation
?
?
How
widespread
is
alienation
?
?
What
is
its
incidence
among
the
various
classes
and
subgroups
of
the
population
?
?
Taking
alienation
as
a
dependent
variable
,
with
what
socio-structural
factors
is
it
most
highly
associated
?
?
Considered
as
an
independent
variable
,
how
does
it
affect
behavior
in
various
sectors
of
life
?
?
Until
such
work
is
done
,
there
must
remain
the
nagging
suspicion
that
alienation
may
be
little
more
than
an
expression
of
the
malaise
of
the
intellectual
,
who
,
rejected
by
and
in
turn
rejecting
the
larger
society
,
projects
his
own
fear
and
despair
onto
the
broader
social
screen
.
I
am
not
suggesting
that
Fromm
ought
to
do
this
kind
of
work
.
Nor
do
I
think
that
alienation
is
nothing
more
than
a
projection
of
the
malaise
of
the
intellectual
.
I
am
saying
only
that
until
a
fuller
and
different
kind
of
evidence
comes
in
,
any
discussion
of
alienation
must
be
understood
to
have
certain
important
limitations
.
Until
such
evidence
appears
,
we
must
make
do
with
the
evidence
we
have
.
Here
,
perhaps
,
Fromm
is
vulnerable
,
for
he
does
not
always
use
the
best
and
most
recent
evidence
available
,
and
he
sometimes
selects
and
interprets
the
evidence
in
rather
special
ways
.
Three
examples
follow
.
Fromm's
analysis
of
alienation
in
the
sphere
of
production
centers
around
the
concepts
of
the
bureaucratization
of
the
corporation
,
the
separation
of
ownership
from
control
,
and
the
broad
(
and
thus
from
the
point
of
view
of
corporate
control
,
ineffective
)
dispersion
of
stock
ownership
.
For
all
these
points
he
relies
exclusively
on
Berle
and
Means's
study
of
1932
,
The
Modern
Corporation
And
Private
Property
.
The
broad
conclusions
of
that
pioneering
work
remain
undisturbed
,
but
subsequent
research
has
expanded
and
somewhat
altered
their
empirical
support
,
has
suggested
important
revisions
in
the
general
analytic
frame
of
reference
,
and
has
sharpened
the
meaning
of
particular
analytic
concepts
in
this
area
.
Fromm
seems
unaware
of
these
developments
.
Another
example
is
his
very
infrequent
use
of
the
large
amount
of
data
from
surveys
designed
to
discover
what
and
how
people
actually
do
feel
and
think
on
a
broad
range
of
topics
:
he
cites
such
survey-type
findings
just
three
times
.
Moreover
,
the
conclusions
he
draws
from
the
findings
are
not
always
the
only
ones
possible
.
For
example
,
he
cites
the
following
data
from
two
studies
on
job
satisfaction
:
in
the
first
study
,
85
per
cent
of
professionals
and
executives
,
64
per
cent
of
white
collar
people
,
and
41
per
cent
of
factory
workers
expressed
satisfaction
with
their
jobs
;
;
in
the
second
study
,
the
percentages
were
86
for
professionals
,
74
for
managerial
persons
,
42
for
commercial
employees
,
56
for
skilled
workers
,
and
48
for
semi-skilled
workers
.
He
concludes
that
these
data
show
a
``
remarkably
high
''
percentage
of
consciously
dissatisfied
and
unhappy
persons
among
factory
and
clerical
workers
.
Starting
from
other
value
premises
than
Fromm's
,
some
analysts
might
conclude
that
the
percentages
really
tell
us
very
little
at
all
,
while
others
might
even
conclude
that
the
figures
are
remarkably
low
.
Eric
Hoffer
,
for
example
,
once
said
that
America
was
a
paradise
--
the
only
one
in
the
history
of
the
world
--
for
workingmen
and
small
children
.
What
matters
is
that
while
Fromm's
reading
of
the
data
is
not
the
only
one
possible
,
it
is
precisely
the
one
we
would
expect
from
a
writer
who
earnestly
believes
that
every
man
can
and
ought
to
be
happy
and
satisfied
.
Fromm
also
cites
a
poll
on
attitudes
toward
work
restriction
conducted
by
the
Opinion
Research
Corporation
in
1945
,
in
which
49
per
cent
of
manual
workers
said
a
man
ought
to
turn
out
as
much
as
he
could
in
a
day's
work
,
while
41
per
cent
said
he
should
not
do
his
best
but
should
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
.
Fromm
says
these
data
show
that
job
dissatisfaction
and
resentment
are
widespread
.
That
is
one
way
to
read
the
findings
,
but
again
there
are
other
ways
.
One
might
use
such
findings
to
indicate
the
strength
of
informal
primary
associations
in
the
factory
,
an
interpretation
which
would
run
counter
to
Fromm's
theory
of
alienation
.
Or
,
he
might
remind
Fromm
that
the
41
per
cent
figure
is
really
astonishingly
low
:
after
all
,
the
medieval
guild
system
was
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
100
per
cent
of
the
workers
ought
to
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
;
;
and
today's
trade
unions
announce
pretty
much
the
same
view
.
In
view
of
these
shortcomings
in
both
the
amount
and
the
interpretation
of
survey-type
findings
on
public
opinion
,
and
considering
the
criticisms
which
can
be
brought
against
Fromm's
philosophical
anthropology
,
such
a
passage
as
the
following
cannot
be
taken
seriously
.
``
Are
people
happy
,
are
they
as
satisfied
,
unconsciously
,
as
they
believe
themselves
to
be
?
?
Considering
the
nature
of
man
,
and
the
conditions
for
happiness
,
this
can
hardly
be
so
''
.
The
ambiguities
suggested
above
stem
from
a
more
basic
difficulty
in
Fromm's
style
of
thought
.
He
seems
to
use
the
term
alienation
in
two
different
ways
.
Sometimes
he
uses
it
as
a
subjective
,
descriptive
term
,
and
sometimes
as
an
objective
,
diagnostic
one
.
That
is
,
sometimes
it
is
used
to
describe
felt
human
misery
,
and
other
times
it
is
postulated
to
explain
unfelt
anxiety
and
discontent
.
The
failure
to
keep
these
two
usages
distinct
presents
hazards
to
the
reader
.
It
also
permits
Fromm
to
do
some
dubious
things
with
empirical
findings
.
When
alienation
is
used
as
an
objective
and
diagnostic
category
,
for
example
,
it
becomes
clear
that
Fromm
would
have
to
say
that
awareness
of
alienation
goes
far
toward
conquering
it
.
(
He
,
in
effect
,
does
say
this
in
his
discussion
of
the
pseudo-happiness
of
the
automaton
conformist
.
)
Starting
from
this
,
and
accepting
his
estimate
of
the
iniquities
of
modern
society
,
it
would
follow
that
the
really
disturbing
evidence
of
alienation
would
be
that
of
a
work-satisfaction
survey
which
reported
widespread
,
stated
worker
satisfaction
,
rather
than
widespread
,
stated
worker
dissatisfaction
.
The
point
is
that
in
a
system
such
as
Fromm's
which
recognizes
unconscious
motivations
,
and
which
rests
on
certain
ethical
absolutes
,
empirical
data
can
be
used
to
support
whatever
proposition
the
writer
is
urging
at
the
moment
.
Thus
,
in
the
example
cited
above
Fromm
rests
his
whole
case
on
the
premise
that
the
workers
are
being
deprived
unconsciously
,
unknowingly
,
of
fulfillment
,
and
then
supports
this
with
survey
data
reporting
conscious
,
experienced
frustrations
.
He
has
his
cake
and
eats
it
too
:
if
the
workers
say
they
are
dissatisfied
,
this
shows
conscious
alienation
;
;
if
they
say
they
are
satisfied
,
this
shows
unconscious
alienation
.
This
sort
of
manipulation
is
especially
troublesome
in
Fromm's
work
because
,
although
his
system
is
derived
largely
from
certain
philosophic
convictions
,
he
asserts
that
it
is
based
on
empirical
findings
drawn
both
from
social
science
and
from
his
own
consulting
room
.
While
the
``
empirical
psychoanalytic
''
label
which
Fromm
claims
sheds
no
light
on
the
validity
of
his
underlying
philosophy
,
it
does
increase
the
marketability
of
his
product
.
The
final
example
of
the
failure
to
use
available
evidence
,
though
evidence
of
a
different
kind
from
that
which
has
so
far
been
considered
,
comes
from
Fromm's
treatment
of
some
other
writers
who
have
dealt
with
the
same
themes
.
In
a
brief
chapter
dealing
with
``
Various
Other
Diagnoses
''
,
he
quotes
isolated
passages
from
some
writers
whose
views
seem
to
corroborate
his
own
,
and
finds
it
``
most
remarkable
that
a
critical
view
of
twentieth-century
society
was
already
held
by
a
number
of
thinkers
living
in
the
nineteenth
.
''
He
finds
it
equally
``
remarkable
that
their
critical
diagnosis
and
prognosis
should
have
so
much
in
common
among
themselves
and
with
the
critics
of
the
twentieth
century
''
.
There
is
nothing
remarkable
about
this
at
all
.
It
is
largely
a
matter
of
finding
passages
that
suit
one's
purposes
.
There
is
a
difference
between
evidence
and
illustration
,
and
Fromm's
citation
of
the
other
diagnosticians
fits
the
latter
category
.
Glance
at
the
list
:
Burckhardt
,
Tolstoy
,
Proudhon
,
Thoreau
,
London
,
Marx
,
Tawney
,
Mayo
,
Durkheim
,
Tannenbaum
,
Mumford
,
A.
R.
Heron
,
Huxley
,
Schweitzer
,
and
Einstein
.
This
is
a
delightfully
motley
collection
.
One
can
make
them
say
the
same
thing
only
by
not
listening
to
them
very
carefully
and
hearing
only
what
one
wants
to
hear
.
The
method
of
selection
Fromm
uses
achieves
exactly
that
.
Furthermore
,
the
list
is
interesting
for
its
omissions
.
It
omits
,
for
example
,
practically
the
whole
line
of
great
nineteenth
century
English
social
critics
,
nearly
all
the
great
writers
whose
basic
position
is
religious
,
and
all
those
who
are
with
more
or
less
accuracy
called
Existentialists
.
Of
course
,
the
list
also
excludes
all
writers
who
are
fairly
``
optimistic
''
about
the
modern
situation
;
;
these
,
almost
by
definition
,
are
spokesmen
for
an
alienated
ideology
.
It
is
not
hard
to
find
that
concurrence
of
opinion
which
Fromm
finds
so
remarkable
when
you
ignore
all
who
hold
a
different
opinion
.
Turning
from
these
problems
of
the
use
of
evidence
,
one
meets
another
type
of
difficulty
in
Fromm's
analysis
,
which
is
his
loose
and
ambiguous
use
of
certain
important
terms
.
One
such
instance
has
already
been
presented
:
his
use
of
alienation
.
The
only
other
one
I
shall
mention
here
is
his
use
of
the
term
capitalism
.
For
Fromm
,
capitalism
is
the
enemy
,
the
root
of
all
evil
.
It
is
of
course
useful
to
have
a
sovereign
cause
on
one's
social
criticism
,
for
it
makes
diagnosis
and
prescription
much
easier
than
they
might
otherwise
be
.
If
one
characteristic
distinguishes
Boris
Godunov
,
it
is
the
consistency
with
which
every
person
on
the
stage
--
including
the
chorus
--
comes
alive
in
the
music
.
Much
of
this
lifelike
quality
results
from
Mussorgsky's
care
in
basing
his
vocal
line
on
natural
speech
inflections
.
In
this
he
followed
a
path
that
led
back
to
the
very
source
of
opera
;
;
such
composers
as
Monteverdi
,
Lully
and
Purcell
,
with
the
same
goal
in
mind
,
had
developed
styles
of
recitative
sensitively
attuned
to
their
own
languages
.
Through
long
experimentation
in
his
songs
,
Mussorgsky
developed
a
Russian
recitative
as
different
from
others
as
the
language
itself
.
Giving
most
of
his
musical
continuity
to
the
orchestra
,
he
lets
the
speech
fall
into
place
as
if
by
coincidence
,
but
controlling
the
pace
and
emphasis
of
the
words
.
The
moments
of
sung
melody
,
in
the
usual
sense
,
come
most
often
when
the
character
is
actually
supposed
to
be
singing
,
as
in
folk
songs
and
liturgical
chants
.
Otherwise
Mussorgsky
reserves
his
vocal
melodies
for
prolonged
expressions
of
emotion
--
Boris'
first
monologue
,
for
example
.
Even
then
,
the
flexibility
of
the
phrasing
suggests
that
the
word
comes
first
in
importance
.
Aside
from
Boris
himself
,
one
need
but
examine
the
secondary
roles
to
place
Mussorgsky
among
the
masters
of
musical
portraiture
.
Even
those
who
appear
in
only
one
or
two
scenes
are
full
personalities
,
defined
with
economical
precision
.
Consider
the
four
monks
who
figure
prominently
in
the
action
:
Pimen
,
Varlaam
,
Missail
and
the
Jesuit
Rangoni
.
Under
no
circumstances
could
we
mistake
one
for
the
other
;
;
each
musical
setting
has
an
individual
touch
.
Pimen
is
an
old
man
,
weak
in
body
--
his
voice
rarely
rises
to
a
full
forte
--
but
firm
and
clear
of
mind
.
His
calmness
offers
contrast
to
Grigori's
youthful
excitement
.
A
quiet
but
sturdy
theme
,
somewhat
folklike
in
character
,
appears
whenever
the
old
monk
speaks
of
the
history
he
is
recording
or
of
his
own
past
life
:
This
theme
comes
to
represent
the
outer
world
,
the
realm
of
battles
and
banquets
--
seen
from
a
distance
,
quite
distinct
from
the
quieter
spiritual
life
in
the
monastery
.
It
changes
and
develops
according
to
the
text
;
;
it
introduces
Pimen
when
he
comes
before
Boris
in
the
last
act
.
Once
he
has
been
identified
,
however
,
a
new
melody
is
used
to
accompany
his
narrative
,
a
bleak
motif
with
barren
octaves
creating
a
rather
ancient
effect
:
An
imaginative
storyteller
,
Pimen
takes
on
the
character
he
describes
,
as
if
he
were
experiencing
the
old
shepherd's
blindness
and
miraculous
cure
.
Here
the
composer
uses
a
favorite
device
of
his
,
the
intensification
of
the
mood
through
key
relationships
.
The
original
D
minor
seems
to
symbolize
blindness
,
inescapable
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
move
away
from
it
.
As
the
child
addresses
the
shepherd
in
a
dream
,
light
--
in
the
form
of
the
major
mode
--
begins
to
appear
,
and
at
the
moment
of
the
miracle
we
hear
a
clear
and
shining
D
major
.
Varlaam
and
Missail
always
appear
together
and
often
sing
together
,
in
a
straightforward
,
rhythmically
vigorous
idiom
that
distinguishes
them
from
the
more
subtle
and
well-educated
Pimen
.
Their
begging
song
might
easily
be
a
folk
melody
:
The
same
could
be
said
for
the
song
to
which
they
make
their
entrance
in
the
final
scene
.
Apparently
their
origin
is
humble
,
their
approach
to
life
direct
and
unsophisticated
.
Whatever
learning
they
may
have
had
in
their
order
doesn't
disturb
them
now
.
Missail
is
the
straight
man
,
not
very
talkative
,
mild-mannered
when
he
does
speak
.
Varlaam
is
loud
,
rowdy
,
uninhibited
in
his
pleasures
and
impatient
with
anyone
who
is
not
the
same
.
A
rough
ostinato
figure
,
heard
first
in
the
introduction
to
the
inn
scene
,
characterizes
him
amusingly
and
reappears
whenever
he
comes
into
the
action
:
The
Song
Of
Kazan
,
in
which
this
figure
becomes
a
wild-sounding
accompaniment
,
fills
in
the
picture
of
undisciplined
high
spirits
.
The
phrasing
is
irregular
,
and
the
abrupt
key
changes
have
a
primitive
forcefulness
.
(
We
can
imagine
how
they
startled
audiences
of
the
1870's
.
)
Varlaam's
music
begins
to
ramble
as
he
feels
the
effects
of
the
wine
,
but
he
pulls
himself
together
when
the
need
arises
.
Both
monks
respond
to
the
guard's
challenge
with
a
few
phrases
of
their
begging
song
;
;
a
clever
naturalistic
touch
is
Varlaam's
labored
reading
of
the
warrant
.
As
the
knack
gradually
comes
back
to
him
,
his
rhythm
becomes
steadier
,
with
the
rigid
monotony
of
an
unskilled
reader
.
For
the
only
time
in
the
opera
,
words
are
not
set
according
to
their
natural
inflection
;
;
to
do
so
would
have
spoiled
the
dramatic
point
of
the
scene
.
Musically
and
dramatically
,
Rangoni
is
as
far
removed
from
the
conventional
monk
as
Varlaam
.
His
music
shows
a
sensuality
coupled
with
an
eerie
quality
that
suggest
somehow
a
blood-kinship
with
Dappertutto
in
Offenbach's
Hoffman
.
His
speech
shows
none
of
the
native
accent
of
the
Russian
characters
;
;
in
spite
of
the
Italian
name
,
he
sounds
French
.
His
personality
appears
more
striking
by
contrast
with
Marina
,
who
is
--
perhaps
purposely
--
rather
superficially
characterized
.
Rangoni's
first
entrance
is
a
musical
shock
,
a
sudden
open
fifth
in
a
key
totally
unrelated
to
what
has
preceded
it
.
The
effect
is
as
if
he
had
materialized
out
of
nowhere
.
He
speaks
quietly
,
concealing
his
authority
beneath
a
smooth
humility
,
just
as
the
shifting
harmonies
that
accompany
him
all
but
hide
the
firm
pedal
point
beneath
them
.
He
addresses
Marina
with
great
deference
,
calling
her
``
Princess
''
at
first
;
;
it
is
only
after
he
has
involved
her
emotions
in
his
scheme
that
he
uses
her
given
name
,
placing
himself
by
implication
in
the
position
of
a
solicitous
father
.
Curiously
,
this
scene
is
a
close
parallel
to
one
that
Verdi
was
writing
at
the
same
time
,
the
scene
between
Amonasro
and
Aida
.
Rangoni
and
Amonasro
have
the
same
purpose
--
forcing
the
girl
to
charm
the
man
she
loves
into
serving
her
country's
cause
--
and
their
tactics
are
much
the
same
.
Rangoni
begins
by
describing
the
sad
state
of
the
Church
;
;
this
brings
a
reaction
of
distress
from
Marina
.
The
music
becomes
ethereal
as
he
calls
up
a
vision
of
her
own
sainthood
:
it
is
she
,
he
tells
her
,
who
can
bring
the
truth
to
Russia
and
convert
the
heretics
.
As
if
in
a
trance
,
she
repeats
his
words
--
then
realizes
,
with
a
shock
,
her
own
audacity
.
This
is
no
assignment
for
a
frivolous
girl
,
she
assures
him
.
Now
Rangoni
comes
to
the
point
,
and
we
hear
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
long
,
downward
chromatic
scale
that
will
become
the
characteristic
motif
of
his
sinister
power
.
It
is
a
phrase
as
arresting
as
a
magician's
gesture
,
with
a
piquant
turn
of
harmony
giving
an
effect
of
strangeness
.
Another
theme
,
sinuously
chromatic
,
appears
as
he
directs
her
to
gain
power
over
Grigori
by
any
means
,
even
at
the
cost
of
her
honor
.
Coming
from
a
priest
,
the
music
sounds
as
odd
as
the
advice
:
Marina
rebels
at
this
suggestion
.
Her
pride
is
as
much
at
stake
as
her
virtue
;
;
she
is
the
unattainable
beauty
,
the
princess
who
turns
away
suitors
by
the
dozen
.
Indignantly
she
denounces
Rangoni
for
his
evil
thoughts
and
orders
him
to
leave
her
.
At
once
the
Jesuit
pulls
out
all
the
stops
.
To
music
of
a
menacing
darkness
,
he
describes
the
powers
of
Satan
gaining
control
of
the
girl
,
poisoning
her
soul
with
pride
and
destroying
her
beauty
.
The
combined
threat
of
hell-fire
and
ugliness
is
too
much
for
her
,
and
she
falls
terrified
at
his
feet
.
With
another
sudden
change
of
mood
,
he
is
again
calm
and
protective
,
exhorting
her
to
trust
and
obey
him
as
God's
spokesman
--
and
the
chromatic
scale
descends
in
ominous
contradiction
.
Whatever
the
source
of
Rangoni's
power
,
Marina
is
his
captive
now
;
;
we
are
reminded
of
this
at
the
end
of
the
next
scene
,
when
his
theme
cuts
through
the
warmth
of
the
love
duet
,
again
throwing
a
chill
over
the
atmosphere
.
The
most
unusual
feature
of
Boris
,
however
,
is
the
use
of
the
greatest
character
of
all
,
the
chorus
.
This
is
the
real
protagonist
of
the
drama
;
;
the
conflict
is
not
Boris
versus
Grigori
or
Shuiski
or
even
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
child
,
but
Boris
versus
the
Russian
people
.
Mussorgsky
makes
this
quite
clear
by
the
extent
to
which
choral
scenes
propel
the
action
.
Boris'
first
entrance
seems
almost
a
footnote
to
the
splendor
of
the
Coronation
Scene
,
with
its
dazzling
confusion
of
tonalities
.
We
have
a
brief
glimpse
of
the
Tsar's
public
personality
,
the
``
official
Boris
''
,
but
our
real
focus
is
on
the
excitement
of
the
crowd
--
a
significant
contrast
with
its
halfhearted
acclamation
in
the
opening
scene
,
its
bitter
resentment
and
fury
in
the
final
act
.
One
reason
for
the
unique
vitality
of
the
chorus
is
its
great
variety
in
expression
.
It
rarely
speaks
as
a
unit
.
Even
in
its
most
conventional
appearance
,
the
guests'
song
of
praise
to
Marina
,
there
are
a
few
female
dissenters
criticizing
the
princess
for
her
coldness
.
In
many
passages
--
for
example
,
the
council
of
boyars
--
each
section
of
the
chorus
becomes
a
character
group
with
a
particular
opinion
.
Hot
arguments
arise
between
tenors
and
basses
,
who
will
sing
in
harmony
only
when
they
agree
on
an
idea
.
The
opening
scene
shows
this
method
at
its
most
individual
.
Mussorgsky
paints
a
telling
picture
of
the
common
people
,
those
who
must
suffer
the
effects
of
their
rulers'
struggle
for
power
without
understanding
the
causes
.
They
are
held
in
control
by
force
,
but
barely
.
They
will
kneel
and
plead
for
Boris'
leadership
in
a
strangely
intense
song
,
its
phrases
irregularly
broken
as
if
gasping
for
breath
,
but
when
the
police
with
their
cudgels
move
away
,
they
mock
and
grumble
and
fight
among
themselves
.
There
is
a
quick
change
from
the
plaintive
song
to
a
conversational
tone
.
``
Hey
,
Mityukh
''
,
asks
one
group
,
``
what
are
we
shouting
about
''
?
?
And
Mityukh
,
apparently
the
intellectual
leader
of
the
crowd
,
replies
that
he
has
no
notion
.
The
jokes
and
arguments
grow
louder
until
the
police
return
;
;
then
the
people
strike
up
their
song
with
even
more
fervor
than
before
,
ending
it
with
a
wail
of
despair
.
Mussorgsky
frequently
uses
liturgical
music
with
considerable
dramatic
force
.
In
Pimen's
cell
the
soft
prayers
of
the
monks
,
heard
from
offstage
,
not
only
help
to
set
the
scene
but
emphasize
the
contrast
between
young
Grigori's
thoughts
and
his
situation
.
This
is
especially
striking
between
Pimen's
quiet
exit
and
Grigori's
vehement
outburst
against
Boris
.
Again
,
as
Boris
feels
himself
nearing
death
,
a
procession
files
into
the
hall
singing
a
hymn
,
its
modal
harmonies
adding
a
churchly
touch
to
the
grim
atmosphere
:
The
words
are
hardly
calculated
to
put
the
Tsar's
mind
at
ease
.
They
echo
the
words
with
which
he
has
described
his
own
vision
of
the
dying
child
who
``
trembles
and
begs
for
mercy
--
and
there
is
no
mercy
''
.
The
living
as
well
as
the
dead
now
accuse
him
;
;
this
final
reminder
of
his
guilt
is
the
fatal
one
.
One
of
the
outstanding
assets
of
the
present
production
is
the
restoration
of
the
St.
Basil's
scene
,
usually
omitted
from
performances
and
rarely
included
in
a
published
score
.
Though
brief
,
it
has
a
sharp
dramatic
edge
and
great
poignancy
.
In
addition
,
it
is
an
important
link
in
the
plot
,
giving
us
a
revealing
glimpse
of
the
people's
attitude
toward
Boris
and
the
false
Dimitri
.
The
mayhem
in
the
forest
of
Kromy
is
a
natural
sequel
.
The
St.
Basil's
scene
opens
with
little
groups
of
beggars
milling
around
the
square
,
the
ever
present
police
keeping
them
under
scrutiny
.
In
the
orchestra
we
hear
first
a
hushed
,
hesitant
pizzicato
figure
,
then
the
insistent
``
police
''
motif
as
it
appeared
in
the
opening
scene
.
The
service
is
over
,
and
a
number
of
people
come
from
the
church
with
their
spokesman
Mityukh
in
the
lead
.
They
bring
the
news
that
the
Pretender
has
been
excommunicated
;
;
this
is
met
with
scorn
by
the
hearers
,
who
claim
that
Mityukh
is
lying
or
drunk
.
(
Mussorgsky
cleverly
contrasts
the
two
groups
by
their
orchestral
accompaniment
,
solemn
chords
or
mocking
staccatos
.
)
There
is
still
more
news
,
Mityukh
announces
:
they
have
prayed
for
the
soul
of
the
Tsarevich
.
So
far
these
remarks
,
like
most
criticisms
of
Hardy
,
have
tacitly
assumed
that
his
poetry
is
all
of
a
piece
,
one
solid
mass
of
verse
expressing
a
sensibility
at
a
single
stage
of
development
.
For
critics
,
Hardy
has
had
no
poetic
periods
--
one
does
not
speak
of
early
Hardy
or
late
Hardy
,
or
of
the
London
or
Max
Gate
period
,
but
simply
of
Hardy
,
as
of
a
poetic
monolith
.
This
seems
odd
when
one
recalls
that
he
wrote
poetry
longer
than
any
other
major
English
poet
:
``
Domicilium
''
is
dated
``
between
1857
and
1860
''
;
;
``
Seeing
The
Moon
Rise
''
is
dated
August
,
1927
.
One
might
expect
that
in
a
poetic
career
of
seventy-odd
years
,
some
changes
in
style
and
method
would
have
occurred
,
some
development
taken
place
.
This
is
not
,
however
,
the
case
,
and
development
is
a
term
which
we
can
apply
to
Hardy
only
in
a
very
limited
sense
.
In
a
time
when
poetic
style
,
and
poetic
belief
as
well
,
seem
in
a
state
of
continual
flux
,
Hardy
stands
out
as
a
poet
of
almost
perverse
consistency
.
Though
he
struggled
with
philosophy
all
his
life
,
he
never
got
much
beyond
the
pessimism
of
his
twenties
;
;
the
``
sober
opinion
''
of
his
letter
to
Noyes
,
written
when
Hardy
was
eighty
years
old
,
is
essentially
that
of
his
first
``
philosophical
''
notebook
entry
,
made
when
he
was
twenty-five
:
``
The
world
does
not
despise
us
:
it
only
neglects
us
''
(
Early
Life
,
p.
63
)
.
And
though
in
his
later
years
he
revised
his
poems
many
times
,
the
revisions
did
not
alter
the
essential
nature
of
the
style
which
he
had
established
before
he
was
thirty
;
;
so
that
,
while
it
usually
is
easy
to
recognize
a
poem
by
Hardy
,
it
is
difficult
to
date
one
.
There
is
only
one
sense
in
which
it
is
valid
to
talk
about
Hardy's
development
:
he
did
develop
toward
a
more
consistent
and
more
effective
control
of
that
tone
which
we
recognize
as
uniquely
his
.
There
is
only
one
Hardy
style
,
but
in
the
earlier
poems
that
style
is
only
intermittently
evident
,
and
when
it
is
not
,
the
style
is
the
style
of
another
poet
,
or
of
the
fashion
of
the
time
.
In
the
later
poems
,
however
,
the
personal
tone
predominates
.
The
bad
early
poems
are
bad
Shakespeare
or
bad
Swinburne
;
;
the
bad
late
poems
are
bad
Hardy
.
There
are
two
ways
of
getting
at
a
poet's
development
:
through
his
dated
poems
,
and
through
the
revisions
which
he
made
in
later
editions
of
his
work
.
About
a
quarter
of
Hardy's
poems
carry
an
appended
date
line
,
usually
the
year
of
completion
,
but
sometimes
inclusive
years
(
``
1908
-
1910
''
)
or
two
separate
dates
when
Hardy
worked
on
the
poem
(
``
1905
and
1926
''
)
or
an
approximate
date
(
``
During
the
War
''
)
.
These
dates
are
virtually
the
only
clues
we
have
to
the
chronology
of
the
poems
,
since
the
separate
volumes
are
neither
chronological
within
themselves
nor
in
relation
to
each
other
.
With
the
exception
of
Satires
Of
Circumstance
,
each
volume
contains
dated
poems
ranging
over
several
decades
(
Winter
Words
spans
sixty-one
years
)
;
;
the
internal
organization
rarely
has
any
chronological
order
,
except
in
obvious
groups
like
the
``
Poems
of
Pilgrimage
''
,
the
``
Poems
of
1912
-
13
''
,
and
the
war
poems
.
From
the
dated
poems
we
can
venture
certain
conclusions
about
Hardy's
career
in
poetry
,
always
remembering
that
conclusions
based
on
a
fraction
of
the
whole
must
remain
tentative
.
The
dated
poems
suggest
that
while
Hardy's
concern
with
poetry
may
have
been
constant
,
his
production
was
not
.
He
had
two
productive
periods
,
one
in
the
late
1860's
,
the
other
in
the
decade
from
1910
to
1920
(
half
of
the
dated
poems
are
from
the
latter
period
,
and
these
alone
total
about
one-tenth
of
all
Hardy's
poems
)
.
There
was
one
sterile
period
:
only
one
poem
is
dated
between
1872
and
1882
and
,
except
for
the
poems
written
on
the
trip
to
Italy
in
1887
,
very
few
from
1882
to
1890
.
The
dated
poems
also
give
us
an
idea
of
the
degree
to
which
Hardy
drew
upon
past
productions
for
his
various
volumes
,
and
therefore
probably
are
an
indication
of
the
amount
of
poetry
he
was
writing
at
the
time
.
Poems
Of
The
Past
And
The
Present
and
Time's
Laughing
Stocks
,
both
published
while
Hardy
was
at
work
on
The
Dynasts
,
draw
heavily
on
poems
written
before
1900
.
Satires
Of
Circumstance
and
Moments
Of
Vision
,
coming
during
his
most
productive
decade
,
are
relatively
self-contained
;
;
the
former
contains
no
poem
dated
before
1909
-
10
--
that
is
,
no
poem
from
a
period
covered
by
a
previous
volume
--
and
the
latter
has
only
a
few
such
.
The
last
three
volumes
are
again
more
dependent
on
the
past
,
as
Hardy's
creative
powers
declined
in
his
old
age
.
These
observations
about
Hardy's
productivity
tally
with
the
details
of
his
life
as
we
know
them
.
The
first
productive
period
came
when
he
was
considering
poetry
as
a
vocation
,
before
he
had
decided
to
write
fiction
for
a
living
(
in
his
note
for
Who's
Who
he
wrote
that
he
``
wrote
verses
1865
-
1868
;
;
gave
up
verse
for
prose
,
1868
-
70
;
;
but
resumed
it
later
''
)
.
During
the
poetically
sterile
years
he
was
writing
novels
at
the
rate
of
almost
one
a
year
and
was
,
in
addition
,
burdened
with
bad
health
(
he
spent
six
months
in
bed
in
1881
,
too
ill
to
do
more
than
work
slowly
and
painfully
at
A
Laodicean
)
.
Two
entries
in
The
Early
Life
support
the
assumption
that
during
this
period
Hardy
had
virtually
suspended
the
writing
of
poetry
.
Mrs.
Hardy
records
that
``
at
the
end
of
November
(
1881
)
he
makes
a
note
of
an
intention
to
resume
poetry
as
soon
as
possible
''
(
Early
Life
,
p.
188
)
;
;
and
on
Christmas
Day
,
1890
,
Hardy
wrote
:
``
While
thinking
of
resuming
'
the
viewless
Wings
Of
Poesy
before
dawn
this
morning
,
new
horizons
seemed
to
open
,
and
worrying
pettinesses
to
disappear
''
(
Early
Life
,
p.
302
)
.
There
are
more
poems
dated
in
the
1890's
than
in
the
'80's
--
Hardy
had
apparently
resumed
the
viewless
wings
as
he
decreased
the
volume
of
his
fiction
--
but
none
in
1891
,
the
year
of
Tess
,
and
only
one
in
1895
,
the
year
of
Jude
.
After
1895
the
number
increases
,
and
in
the
next
thirty
years
there
is
only
one
year
for
which
there
is
no
dated
poem
--
1903
,
when
Hardy
was
at
work
on
The
Dynasts
.
The
second
productive
period
,
the
decade
from
1910
to
1920
,
can
be
related
to
three
events
:
the
completion
of
The
Dynasts
in
1909
,
which
left
Hardy
free
of
pressure
for
the
first
time
in
forty
years
;
;
the
death
of
Emma
Hardy
in
1912
,
which
had
a
profound
emotional
effect
on
Hardy
for
which
he
found
release
in
poetry
;
;
and
the
First
World
War
.
It
may
seem
strange
that
a
poet
should
come
to
full
fruition
in
his
seventies
,
but
we
have
it
on
Hardy's
own
authority
that
``
he
was
a
child
till
he
was
sixteen
,
a
youth
till
he
was
five-and-twenty
,
and
a
young
man
till
he
was
nearly
fifty
''
(
Early
Life
,
p.
42
)
.
We
may
carry
this
sequence
one
step
further
and
say
that
at
seventy
he
was
a
poet
at
the
height
of
his
powers
,
wanting
only
the
impetus
of
two
tragedies
,
one
personal
,
the
other
national
,
to
loose
those
powers
in
poetry
.
Hardy's
two
productive
decades
were
separated
by
forty
years
,
yet
between
them
he
developed
only
in
that
he
became
more
steadily
himself
--
it
was
a
narrowing
,
not
an
expanding
process
.
Like
a
wise
gardener
,
Hardy
pruned
away
the
Shakespearian
sonnets
and
songs
,
and
the
elements
of
meter
and
poetic
diction
to
which
his
personal
style
was
not
suited
,
and
let
the
main
stock
of
his
talent
flourish
.
The
range
of
the
later
poetry
is
considerably
narrower
,
but
the
number
of
successful
poems
is
far
greater
.
We
can
see
the
general
characteristics
of
the
earlier
decade
if
we
look
at
two
poems
of
very
different
qualities
:
``
Revulsion
''
(
1866
)
and
``
Neutral
Tones
''
(
1867
)
.
There
is
not
much
to
be
said
for
``
Revulsion
''
.
Like
about
half
of
the
1860
-
70
poems
,
it
is
a
sonnet
on
a
conventional
theme
--
the
unhappiness
of
love
.
Almost
anyone
could
have
written
it
;
;
it
is
competent
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
a
coherent
statement
without
violating
the
rules
of
the
sonnet
form
,
but
it
is
entirely
undistinguished
and
entirely
unlike
Hardy
.
The
language
is
the
conventional
language
of
the
form
;
;
there
is
no
phrase
or
image
that
sounds
like
Hardy
or
that
is
striking
enough
to
give
individuality
to
the
poem
.
It
is
smoother
than
Hardy
usually
is
,
but
with
the
smoothness
of
anonymity
.
It
is
obviously
a
young
man's
poem
,
written
out
of
books
and
not
out
of
experience
;
;
it
asserts
emotion
without
evoking
it
--
that
is
to
say
,
it
is
sentimental
.
There
are
many
such
competently
anonymous
performances
among
the
earlier
poems
.
``
Neutral
Tones
''
we
immediately
recognize
as
a
fine
poem
in
Hardy's
most
characteristic
style
:
the
plain
but
not
quite
colloquial
language
,
the
hard
,
particular
,
colorless
images
,
the
slightly
odd
stanza-form
,
the
dramatic
handling
of
the
occasion
,
the
refusal
to
resolve
the
issue
--
all
these
we
have
seen
in
Hardy's
best
poems
.
The
poem
does
not
distort
the
syntax
of
ordinary
speech
nor
draw
on
exotic
sources
of
diction
,
yet
it
is
obviously
not
ordinary
speech
--
only
Hardy
would
say
``
a
grin
of
bitterness
swept
thereby
;
;
like
an
ominous
bird
a-wing
''
,
or
``
wrings
with
wrong
''
,
or
would
describe
a
winter
sun
as
``
God-curst
''
.
The
details
of
the
setting
of
``
Neutral
Tones
''
are
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
metaphorical
,
but
they
combine
to
create
a
mood
which
is
appropriate
both
to
a
dismal
winter
day
and
to
the
end
of
love
,
and
in
this
way
love
and
weather
,
the
emotions
and
the
elements
,
symbolize
each
other
in
a
way
that
is
common
to
many
of
Hardy's
best
poems
(
``
Weathers
''
,
``
The
Darkling
Thrush
''
,
and
``
During
Wind
and
Rain
''
,
for
example
)
and
to
some
moving
passages
in
the
novels
as
well
(
Far
From
The
Madding
Crowd
is
full
of
scenes
constructed
in
this
way
)
.
``
Neutral
Tones
''
is
an
excellent
example
of
Hardy's
mature
style
,
drawn
from
his
earliest
productive
period
;
;
I
cite
it
as
evidence
that
he
did
not
develop
through
new
styles
as
he
grew
older
(
as
Yeats
did
)
,
but
that
he
simply
learned
to
use
better
what
he
already
had
.
In
the
poem
we
recognize
and
acknowledge
one
man's
sense
of
the
world
;
;
if
it
is
somber
,
it
is
also
precise
,
and
the
precision
lends
authority
to
the
vision
.
In
``
Revulsion
''
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
pessimism
is
a
case
not
proven
;
;
the
poem
offers
nothing
to
persuade
us
of
the
speaker's
right
to
speak
as
he
does
.
In
the
1860
-
70
decade
there
are
many
poems
like
``
Revulsion
''
,
but
there
is
only
one
``
Neutral
Tones
''
.
Hardy
was
not
Hardy
very
often
.
The
``
Poems
of
1912
-
13
''
offer
a
good
example
of
Hardy's
style
as
it
was
manifested
in
the
later
productive
decade
.
These
are
the
poems
Hardy
wrote
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
;
;
they
compose
a
painful
elegy
to
what
might
have
been
,
to
a
marriage
that
began
with
a
promise
of
happiness
,
and
ended
in
long
years
of
suffering
and
hatred
.
Hardy
obviously
felt
that
these
poems
were
peculiarly
personal
and
private
;
;
he
sometimes
called
them
``
an
expiation
''
,
and
he
would
not
allow
them
to
be
published
in
periodicals
.
They
are
the
only
poems
that
he
rearranged
as
a
group
between
their
first
appearance
(
in
Satires
Of
Circumstance
)
and
the
publication
of
the
Collected
Poems
.
The
elegiac
tone
is
Hardy's
natural
tone
of
voice
,
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
1912
-
13
poems
are
consistently
and
unmistakably
his
.
The
view
is
always
toward
the
past
;
;
but
the
mood
is
not
quite
nostalgic
--
Hardy
would
not
allow
sentiment
to
soften
his
sense
of
the
irredeemable
pastness
of
the
past
,
and
the
eternal
deadness
of
the
dead
.
The
poems
are
,
the
epigraph
tells
us
,
the
``
traces
of
an
ancient
flame
''
;
;
the
fire
of
love
is
dead
,
and
Hardy
stands
,
as
the
speaker
does
in
the
last
poem
of
the
sequence
,
over
the
burnt
circle
of
charred
sticks
,
and
thinks
of
past
happiness
and
present
grief
,
honest
and
uncomforted
.
Critically
invisible
,
modern
revolt
,
like
X-rays
and
radioactivity
,
is
perceived
only
by
its
effects
at
more
materialistic
social
levels
,
where
it
is
called
delinquency
.
``
Disaffiliation
''
,
by
the
way
,
is
the
term
used
by
the
critic
and
poet
,
Lawrence
Lipton
,
who
has
written
several
articles
on
this
subject
,
the
first
of
which
,
in
The
Nation
,
quoted
as
Epigraph
:
``
We
disaffiliate
.
''
--
John
L.
Lewis
.
Like
the
pillars
of
Hercules
,
like
two
ruined
Titans
guarding
the
entrance
to
one
of
Dante's
circles
,
stand
two
great
dead
juvenile
delinquents
--
the
heroes
of
the
post-war
generation
:
the
great
saxophonist
,
Charlie
Parker
,
and
Dylan
Thomas
.
If
the
word
deliberate
means
anything
,
both
of
them
certainly
deliberately
destroyed
themselves
.
Both
of
them
were
overcome
by
the
horror
of
the
world
in
which
they
found
themselves
,
because
at
last
they
could
no
longer
overcome
that
world
with
the
weapon
of
a
purely
lyrical
art
.
Both
of
them
were
my
friends
.
Living
in
San
Francisco
I
saw
them
seldom
enough
to
see
them
with
a
perspective
which
was
not
distorted
by
exasperation
or
fatigue
.
So
as
the
years
passed
,
I
saw
them
each
time
in
the
light
of
an
accelerated
personal
conflagration
.
The
last
time
I
saw
Bird
,
at
Jimbo's
Bob
City
,
he
was
so
gone
--
so
blind
to
the
world
--
that
he
literally
sat
down
on
me
before
he
realized
I
was
there
.
``
What
happened
,
man
''
?
?
I
said
,
referring
to
the
pretentious
``
Jazz
Concert
''
.
``
Evil
,
man
,
evil
''
,
he
said
,
and
that's
all
he
said
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
About
dawn
he
got
up
to
blow
.
The
rowdy
crowd
chilled
into
stillness
and
the
fluent
melody
spiraled
through
it
.
The
last
time
I
saw
Dylan
,
his
self-destruction
had
not
just
passed
the
limits
of
rationality
.
It
had
assumed
the
terrifying
inertia
of
inanimate
matter
.
Being
with
him
was
like
being
swept
away
by
a
torrent
of
falling
stones
.
Now
Dylan
Thomas
and
Charlie
Parker
have
a
great
deal
more
in
common
than
the
same
disastrous
end
.
As
artists
,
they
were
very
similar
.
They
were
both
very
fluent
.
But
this
fluent
,
enchanting
utterance
had
,
compared
with
important
artists
of
the
past
,
relatively
little
content
.
Neither
of
them
got
very
far
beyond
a
sort
of
entranced
rapture
at
his
own
creativity
.
The
principal
theme
of
Thomas's
poetry
was
the
ambivalence
of
birth
and
death
--
the
pain
of
blood-stained
creation
.
Music
,
of
course
,
is
not
so
explicit
an
art
,
but
anybody
who
knew
Charlie
Parker
knows
that
he
felt
much
the
same
way
about
his
own
gift
.
Both
of
them
did
communicate
one
central
theme
:
Against
the
ruin
of
the
world
,
there
is
only
one
defense
--
the
creative
act
.
This
,
of
course
,
is
the
theme
of
much
art
--
perhaps
most
poetry
.
It
is
the
theme
of
Horace
,
who
certainly
otherwise
bears
little
resemblance
to
Parker
or
Thomas
.
The
difference
is
that
Horace
accepted
his
theme
with
a
kind
of
silken
assurance
.
To
Dylan
and
Bird
it
was
an
agony
and
terror
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
is
due
to
anything
especially
frightful
about
their
relationship
to
their
own
creativity
.
I
believe
rather
that
it
is
due
to
the
catastrophic
world
in
which
that
creativity
seemed
to
be
the
sole
value
.
Horace's
column
of
imperishable
verse
shines
quietly
enough
in
the
lucid
air
of
Augustan
Rome
.
Art
may
have
been
for
him
the
most
enduring
,
orderly
,
and
noble
activity
of
man
.
But
the
other
activities
of
his
life
partook
of
these
values
.
They
did
not
actively
negate
them
.
Dylan
Thomas's
verse
had
to
find
endurance
in
a
world
of
burning
cities
and
burning
Jews
.
He
was
able
to
find
meaning
in
his
art
as
long
as
it
was
the
answer
to
air
raids
and
gas
ovens
.
As
the
world
began
to
take
on
the
guise
of
an
immense
air
raid
or
gas
oven
,
I
believe
his
art
became
meaningless
to
him
.
I
think
all
this
could
apply
to
Parker
just
as
well
,
although
,
because
of
the
nature
of
music
,
it
is
not
demonstrable
--
at
least
not
conclusively
.
Thomas
and
Parker
have
more
in
common
than
theme
,
attitude
,
life
pattern
.
In
the
practice
of
their
art
,
there
is
an
obvious
technical
resemblance
.
Contrary
to
popular
belief
,
they
were
not
great
technical
innovators
.
Their
effects
are
only
superficially
startling
.
Thomas
is
a
regression
from
the
technical
originality
and
ingenuity
of
writers
like
Pierre
Reverdy
or
Apollinaire
.
Similarly
,
the
innovations
of
bop
,
and
of
Parker
particularly
,
have
been
vastly
overrated
by
people
unfamiliar
with
music
,
especially
by
that
ignoramus
,
the
intellectual
jitterbug
,
the
jazz
aficionado
.
The
tonal
novelties
consist
in
the
introduction
of
a
few
chords
used
in
classical
music
for
centuries
.
And
there
is
less
rhythmic
difference
between
progressive
jazz
,
no
matter
how
progressive
,
and
Dixieland
,
than
there
is
between
two
movements
of
many
conventional
symphonies
.
What
Parker
and
his
contemporaries
--
Gillespie
,
Davis
,
Monk
,
Roach
(
Tristano
is
an
anomaly
)
,
etc.
--
did
was
to
absorb
the
musical
ornamentation
of
the
older
jazz
into
the
basic
structure
,
of
which
it
then
became
an
integral
part
,
and
with
which
it
then
developed
.
This
is
true
of
the
melodic
line
which
could
be
put
together
from
selected
passages
of
almost
anybody
--
Benny
Carter
,
Johnny
Hodges
.
It
is
true
of
the
rhythmic
pattern
in
which
the
beat
shifts
continuously
,
or
at
least
is
continuously
sprung
,
so
that
it
becomes
ambiguous
enough
to
allow
the
pattern
to
be
dominated
by
the
long
pulsations
of
the
phrase
or
strophe
.
This
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
transition
from
baroque
to
rococo
music
.
It
is
the
difference
between
Bach
and
Mozart
.
It
is
not
a
farfetched
analogy
to
say
that
this
is
what
Thomas
did
to
poetry
.
The
special
syntactical
effects
of
a
Rimbaud
or
an
Edith
Sitwell
--
actually
ornaments
--
become
the
main
concern
.
The
metaphysical
conceits
,
which
fascinate
the
Reactionary
Generation
still
dominant
in
backwater
American
colleges
,
were
embroideries
.
Thomas's
ellipses
and
ambiguities
are
ends
in
themselves
.
The
immediate
theme
,
if
it
exists
,
is
incidental
,
and
his
main
theme
--
the
terror
of
birth
--
is
simply
reiterated
.
This
is
one
difference
between
Bird
and
Dylan
which
should
be
pointed
out
.
Again
,
contrary
to
popular
belief
,
there
is
nothing
crazy
or
frantic
about
Parker
either
musically
or
emotionally
.
His
sinuous
melody
is
a
sort
of
naive
transcendence
of
all
experience
.
Emotionally
it
does
not
resemble
Berlioz
or
Wagner
;
;
it
resembles
Mozart
.
This
is
true
also
of
a
painter
like
Jackson
Pollock
.
He
may
have
been
eccentric
in
his
behavior
,
but
his
paintings
are
as
impassive
as
Persian
tiles
.
Partly
this
difference
is
due
to
the
nature
of
verbal
communication
.
The
insistent
talk-aboutiveness
of
the
general
environment
obtrudes
into
even
the
most
idyllic
poetry
.
It
is
much
more
a
personal
difference
.
Thomas
certainly
wanted
to
tell
people
about
the
ruin
and
disorder
of
the
world
.
Parker
and
Pollock
wanted
to
substitute
a
work
of
art
for
the
world
.
Technique
pure
and
simple
,
rendition
,
is
not
of
major
importance
,
but
it
is
interesting
that
Parker
,
following
Lester
Young
,
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
so-called
saxophone
revolution
.
In
modern
jazz
,
the
saxophone
is
treated
as
a
woodwind
and
played
with
conventional
embouchure
.
Metrically
,
Thomas's
verse
was
extremely
conventional
,
as
was
,
incidentally
,
the
verse
of
that
other
tragic
enrage
,
Hart
Crane
.
I
want
to
make
clear
what
I
consider
the
one
technical
development
in
the
first
wave
of
significant
post-war
arts
.
Ornament
is
confabulation
in
the
interstices
of
structure
.
A
poem
by
Dylan
Thomas
,
a
saxophone
solo
by
Charles
Parker
,
a
painting
by
Jackson
Pollock
--
these
are
pure
confabulations
as
ends
in
themselves
.
Confabulation
has
come
to
determine
structure
.
Uninhibited
lyricism
should
be
distinguished
from
its
exact
opposite
--
the
sterile
,
extraneous
invention
of
the
corn-belt
metaphysicals
,
or
present
blight
of
poetic
professors
.
Just
as
Hart
Crane
had
little
influence
on
anyone
except
very
reactionary
writers
--
like
Allen
Tate
,
for
instance
,
to
whom
Valery
was
the
last
word
in
modern
poetry
and
the
felicities
of
an
Apollinaire
,
let
alone
a
Paul
Eluard
were
nonsense
--
so
Dylan
Thomas's
influence
has
been
slight
indeed
.
In
fact
,
his
only
disciple
--
the
only
person
to
imitate
his
style
--
was
W.
S.
Graham
,
who
seems
to
have
imitated
him
without
much
understanding
,
and
who
has
since
moved
on
to
other
methods
.
Thomas's
principal
influence
lay
in
the
communication
of
an
attitude
--
that
of
the
now
extinct
British
romantic
school
of
the
New
Apocalypse
--
Henry
Treece
,
J.
F.
Hendry
,
and
others
--
all
of
whom
were
quite
conventional
poets
.
Parker
certainly
had
much
more
of
an
influence
.
At
one
time
it
was
the
ambition
of
every
saxophone
player
in
every
high
school
band
in
America
to
blow
like
Bird
.
Even
before
his
death
this
influence
had
begun
to
ebb
.
In
fact
,
the
whole
generation
of
the
founding
fathers
of
bop
--
Gillespie
,
Monk
,
Davis
,
Blakey
,
and
the
rest
--
are
just
now
at
a
considerable
discount
.
The
main
line
of
development
today
goes
back
to
Lester
Young
and
by-passes
them
.
The
point
is
that
many
of
the
most
impressive
developments
in
the
arts
nowadays
are
aberrant
,
idiosyncratic
.
There
is
no
longer
any
sense
of
continuing
development
of
the
sort
that
can
be
traced
from
Baudelaire
to
Eluard
,
or
for
that
matter
,
from
Hawthorne
through
Henry
James
to
Gertrude
Stein
.
The
cubist
generation
before
World
War
1
,
,
and
,
on
a
lower
level
,
the
surrealists
of
the
period
between
the
wars
,
both
assumed
an
accepted
universe
of
discourse
,
in
which
,
to
quote
Andre
Breton
,
it
was
possible
to
make
definite
advances
,
exactly
as
in
the
sciences
.
I
doubt
if
anyone
holds
such
ideas
today
.
Continuity
exits
,
but
like
the
neo-swing
music
developed
from
Lester
Young
,
it
is
a
continuity
sustained
by
popular
demand
.
In
the
plastic
arts
,
a
very
similar
situation
exists
.
Surrealists
like
Hans
Arp
and
Max
Ernst
might
talk
of
creation
by
hazard
--
of
composing
pictures
by
walking
on
them
with
painted
soles
,
or
by
tossing
bits
of
paper
up
in
the
air
.
But
it
is
obvious
that
they
were
self-deluded
.
Nothing
looks
anything
like
an
Ernst
or
an
Arp
but
another
Ernst
or
Arp
.
Nothing
looks
less
like
their
work
than
the
happenings
of
random
occasion
.
Many
of
the
post-World
War
2
,
abstract
expressionists
,
apostles
of
the
discipline
of
spontaneity
and
hazard
,
look
alike
,
and
do
look
like
accidents
.
The
aesthetic
appeal
of
pure
paint
laid
on
at
random
may
exist
,
but
it
is
a
very
impoverished
appeal
.
Once
again
what
has
happened
is
an
all-consuming
confabulation
of
the
incidentals
,
the
accidents
of
painting
.
It
is
curious
that
at
its
best
,
the
work
of
this
school
of
painting
--
Mark
Rothko
,
Jackson
Pollock
,
Clyfford
Still
,
Robert
Motherwell
,
Willem
De-Kooning
,
and
the
rest
--
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
the
passage
painting
of
quite
unimpressive
painters
:
the
mother-of-pearl
shimmer
in
the
background
of
a
Henry
McFee
,
itself
a
formula
derived
from
Renoir
;
;
the
splashes
of
light
and
black
which
fake
drapery
in
the
fashionable
imitators
of
Hals
and
Sargent
.
Often
work
of
this
sort
is
presented
as
calligraphy
--
the
pure
utterance
of
the
brush
stroke
seeking
only
absolute
painteresque
values
.
You
have
only
to
compare
such
painting
with
the
work
of
,
say
,
Sesshu
,
to
realize
that
someone
is
using
words
and
brushes
carelessly
.
At
its
best
the
abstract
expressionists
achieve
a
simple
rococo
decorative
surface
.
Its
poverty
shows
up
immediately
when
compared
with
Tiepolo
,
where
the
rococo
rises
to
painting
of
extraordinary
profundity
and
power
.
A
Tiepolo
painting
,
however
confabulated
,
is
a
universe
of
tensions
in
vast
depths
.
A
Pollock
is
an
object
of
art
--
bijouterie
--
disguised
only
by
its
great
size
.
In
fact
,
once
the
size
is
big
enough
to
cover
a
whole
wall
,
it
turns
into
nothing
more
than
extremely
expensive
wallpaper
.
Now
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
complicated
wallpaper
.
There
is
just
more
to
Tiepolo
.
The
great
Ashikaga
brush
painters
painted
wallpapers
,
too
--
at
least
portable
ones
,
screens
.
A
process
of
elimination
which
leaves
the
artist
with
nothing
but
the
play
of
his
materials
themselves
cannot
sustain
interest
in
either
artist
or
public
for
very
long
.
So
,
in
the
last
couple
of
years
,
abstract
expressionism
has
tended
toward
romantic
suggestion
--
indications
of
landscape
or
living
figures
.
Anglo-Saxon
and
Greek
epic
each
provide
on
two
occasions
a
seemingly
authentic
account
of
the
narration
of
verse
in
the
heroic
age
.
Hrothgar's
court
bard
sings
of
the
encounters
at
Finnsburg
(
lines
1068
-
1159
)
,
and
improvises
the
tale
of
Beowulf's
exploits
in
a
complimentary
comparison
of
the
Geatish
visitor
with
Sigemund
(
lines
871
-
892
)
;
;
Alcinous'
court
bard
sings
of
the
discovered
adultery
of
Ares
and
Aphrodite
(
Odyssey
8
266-366
)
,
and
takes
up
a
tale
of
Odysseus
while
the
Ithacan
wanderer
listens
on
(
Odyssey
8
499-520
)
.
Nothing
in
all
this
is
autobiographical
:
unlike
the
poets
of
Deor
and
Widsith
,
the
poet
of
Beowulf
is
not
concerned
with
his
own
identity
;
;
the
poet
of
The
Odyssey
,
reputed
blind
,
reveals
himself
not
at
all
in
singing
of
the
blind
minstrel
Demodocus
.
Since
none
of
these
glimpses
of
poetizing
without
writing
is
intended
to
incorporate
a
signature
into
the
epic
matter
,
there
is
prima-facie
evidence
that
Beowulf
and
the
Homeric
poems
each
derive
from
an
oral
tradition
.
That
such
a
tradition
lies
behind
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
,
at
least
,
is
hard
to
deny
.
Milman
Parry
rigorously
defended
the
observation
that
the
extant
Homeric
poems
are
largely
formulaic
,
and
was
led
to
postulate
that
they
could
be
shown
entirely
formulaic
if
the
complete
corpus
of
Greek
epic
survived
;
;
he
further
reasoned
that
frequent
formulas
in
epic
verse
indicate
oral
composition
,
and
assumed
the
slightly
less
likely
corollary
that
oral
epic
is
inclined
towards
the
use
of
formulas
.
Proceeding
from
Parry's
conclusions
and
adopting
one
of
his
schemata
,
Francis
P.
Magoun
,
Jr.
,
argues
that
Beowulf
likewise
was
created
from
a
legacy
of
oral
formulas
inherited
and
extended
by
bards
of
successive
generations
,
and
the
thesis
is
striking
and
compelling
.
Yet
a
fresh
inspection
will
indicate
one
crucial
amendment
:
Beowulf
and
the
Homeric
poems
are
not
at
all
formulaic
to
the
same
extent
.
The
bondage
endurable
by
an
oral
poet
is
to
be
estimated
only
by
a
very
skilful
oral
poet
,
but
it
appears
safe
to
assume
that
no
sustained
narrative
in
rhyme
could
be
composed
without
extreme
difficulty
,
even
in
a
language
of
many
terminal
inflections
.
Assonance
seems
nearly
as
severe
a
curb
,
although
in
a
celebrated
passage
William
of
Malmesbury
declares
that
A
Song
Of
Roland
was
intoned
before
the
battle
commenced
at
Hastings
.
The
Anglo-Saxon
alliterative
line
and
the
Homeric
hexameter
probably
imposed
less
of
a
restraint
;
;
the
verse
of
Beowulf
or
of
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
was
not
easy
to
create
but
was
not
impossible
for
poets
who
had
developed
their
talents
perforce
in
earning
a
livelihood
.
Yet
certain
aids
were
valuable
and
quite
credibly
necessary
for
reciting
long
stretches
of
verse
without
a
pause
.
The
poet
in
a
written
tradition
who
generally
never
blots
a
line
may
once
in
a
while
pause
and
polish
without
incurring
blame
.
But
the
oral
poet
cannot
pause
;
;
he
must
improvise
continuously
with
no
apparent
effort
.
Even
though
the
bondage
of
his
verse
is
not
so
great
as
the
writing
poet
can
manage
,
it
is
still
great
enough
for
him
often
to
be
seriously
impeded
unless
he
has
aids
to
facilitate
rapid
composition
.
The
Germanic
poet
had
such
aids
in
the
kennings
,
which
provided
for
the
difficulties
of
alliteration
;
;
the
Homeric
poet
had
epithets
,
which
provided
for
recurring
needs
in
the
hexameter
.
Either
poet
could
quickly
and
easily
select
words
or
phrases
to
supply
his
immediate
requirements
as
he
chanted
out
his
lines
,
because
the
kennings
and
the
epithets
made
possible
the
construction
of
systems
of
numerous
synonyms
for
the
chief
common
and
proper
nouns
.
Other
synonyms
could
of
course
serve
the
same
function
,
and
for
the
sake
of
ease
I
shall
speak
of
kennings
and
epithets
in
the
widest
and
loosest
possible
sense
,
and
name
,
for
example
,
Gar-Dene
a
kenning
for
the
Danes
.
Verbal
and
adverbial
elements
too
participated
in
each
epic
diction
,
but
it
is
for
the
present
sufficient
to
mark
the
large
nominal
and
adjectival
supply
of
semantic
near-equivalents
,
and
to
designate
the
members
of
any
system
of
equivalents
as
basic
formulas
of
the
poetic
language
.
Limited
to
a
few
thousand
lines
of
heroic
verse
in
Anglo-Saxon
as
in
the
other
Germanic
dialects
,
we
cannot
say
how
frequently
the
kennings
in
Beowulf
recurred
in
contemporary
epic
on
the
same
soil
.
But
we
can
say
that
since
a
writing
poet
,
with
leisure
before
him
,
would
seem
unlikely
to
invent
a
technique
based
upon
frequent
and
substantial
circumlocution
,
the
kennings
like
the
epithets
must
reasonably
be
ascribed
to
an
oral
tradition
.
One
of
the
greatest
Homerists
of
our
time
,
Frederick
M.
Combellack
,
argues
that
when
it
is
assumed
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
are
oral
poems
,
the
postulated
single
redactor
called
Homer
cannot
be
either
credited
with
or
denied
originality
in
choice
of
phrasing
.
Any
example
of
grand
or
exquisite
diction
may
have
been
created
by
the
poet
who
compiled
numerous
lays
into
the
two
works
we
possess
or
may
be
due
to
one
of
his
completely
unknown
fellow-craftsmen
.
The
quest
of
the
historical
Homer
is
likely
never
to
have
further
success
;
;
no
individual
word
in
The
Iliad
or
The
Odyssey
can
be
credited
to
any
one
man
;
;
no
strikingly
effective
element
of
speech
in
the
extant
poems
can
with
assurance
be
said
not
to
have
been
a
commonplace
in
the
vaster
epic
corpus
that
may
have
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
millennium
before
Christ
.
This
observation
is
of
interest
not
only
to
students
of
Homeric
poetry
but
to
students
of
Anglo-Saxon
poetry
as
well
.
To
the
extent
that
a
tale
is
twice
told
,
its
final
author
must
be
suspect
,
although
plagiarism
in
an
oral
tradition
is
less
a
misdemeanor
than
the
standard
modus
dicendi
.
Combellack
argues
further
,
and
here
he
makes
his
main
point
,
that
once
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
are
thought
formulaic
poems
composed
for
an
audience
accustomed
to
formulaic
poetry
,
Homeric
critics
are
deprived
of
an
entire
domain
they
previously
found
arable
.
With
a
few
important
and
a
few
more
unimportant
exceptions
,
no
expression
can
be
deemed
le
mot
juste
for
its
context
,
because
each
was
very
probably
the
only
expression
that
long-established
practice
and
ease
of
rapid
recitation
would
allow
.
Words
or
phrases
that
connoisseurs
have
admired
as
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
must
therefore
lose
merit
and
become
regarded
as
mere
inevitable
time-servers
,
sometimes
accurate
and
sometimes
not
.
This
observation
too
may
have
reference
to
Anglo-Saxon
poetry
.
To
the
extent
that
a
language
is
formulaic
,
its
individual
components
must
be
regarded
as
no
more
distinguished
than
other
cliches
.
W.
F.
Bryan
suggests
that
certain
kennings
in
Beowulf
were
selected
sometimes
for
appropriateness
and
sometimes
for
ironic
inappropriateness
,
but
such
a
view
would
appear
untenable
unless
it
is
denied
that
the
language
of
Beowulf
is
formulaic
.
If
the
master
of
scops
who
was
most
responsible
for
the
poem
ever
used
kennings
that
were
traditional
,
he
was
at
least
partly
deprived
of
free
will
and
not
inclined
towards
shrewd
and
sophisticated
misuse
of
speech
elements
.
Once
many
significant
phrases
are
found
in
theory
or
in
recurrent
practice
to
provide
for
prosodic
necessity
,
they
are
not
to
be
defended
for
their
semantic
properties
in
isolated
contexts
.
It
is
false
to
be
certain
of
having
discovered
in
the
language
of
Beowulf
such
effects
as
intentional
irony
.
Yet
,
if
the
argument
is
turned
awry
,
there
may
be
found
a
great
deal
in
Bryan's
view
,
after
all
.
A
formulaic
element
need
not
be
held
meaningless
merely
because
it
was
selected
with
little
conscious
reflection
.
Time-servers
,
though
the
periphrastic
expressions
are
,
they
may
nevertheless
be
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
.
A
long
evolution
in
an
oral
tradition
caused
the
poetic
language
of
the
heroic
age
to
be
based
upon
formulas
that
show
the
important
qualities
of
things
,
and
these
formulas
are
therefore
potentially
rather
than
always
actually
accurate
.
True
,
we
do
not
know
how
they
were
regarded
in
their
day
,
but
we
need
not
believe
the
epic
audience
to
have
been
more
insensitive
to
the
formulas
than
the
numerous
scholars
of
modern
times
who
have
read
Germanic
or
Homeric
poetry
all
their
lives
and
still
found
much
to
admire
in
occasional
occurrences
of
the
most
familiar
phrases
.
Nouns
and
adjectives
in
a
written
tradition
are
chosen
for
the
nonce
;
;
in
an
oral
tradition
they
may
be
chosen
for
the
entire
epic
corpus
,
and
tend
towards
idealization
rather
than
distinctive
delineation
.
Reliance
is
therefore
not
to
be
placed
upon
the
archaeological
particulars
in
an
oral
poem
;
;
no-one
today
would
hope
to
discover
the
unmistakable
ruins
of
Heorot
or
the
palace
of
Priam
.
A
ship
at
dry-dock
could
be
called
a
foamy-necked
floater
in
Anglo-Saxon
or
a
swift
ship
in
Greek
.
Even
when
defenseless
of
weapons
the
Danes
would
be
Gar-Dene
(
as
their
king
is
Hrothgar
)
and
Priam
would
be
EUMMELIHS
.
Achilles
,
like
Siegfried
in
The
Nibelungenlied
,
is
potentially
the
swiftest
of
men
and
may
accordingly
be
called
swift-footed
even
when
he
stands
idle
.
In
Coriolanus
the
agnomen
of
Marcius
is
used
deliberately
and
pointedly
,
but
the
Homeric
epithets
and
the
Anglo-Saxon
kennings
are
used
casually
and
recall
to
the
hearer
``
a
familiar
story
or
situation
or
a
useful
or
pleasant
quality
of
the
referent
''
.
The
epic
language
was
not
entirely
the
servant
of
the
poet
;
;
it
was
partly
his
master
.
The
poet's
intentions
are
difficult
to
discern
and
,
except
to
biographers
,
unimportant
;
;
the
language
,
however
,
is
a
proper
object
of
scrutiny
,
and
the
effects
of
the
language
are
palpable
even
if
sometimes
inevitable
.
Beowulf
and
the
Homeric
poems
appear
oral
compositions
.
Yet
they
are
written
;
;
at
some
stage
in
their
evolution
they
were
transcribed
.
Albert
B.
Lord
suggests
that
the
Homeric
poems
were
dictated
to
a
scribe
by
a
minstrel
who
held
in
his
mind
the
poems
fully
matured
but
did
not
himself
possess
the
knowledge
of
writing
since
it
would
be
useless
to
his
guild
,
and
Magoun
argues
that
the
Beowulf
poet
and
Cynewulf
may
have
dictated
their
verse
in
the
same
fashion
.
This
explanation
is
attractive
,
but
is
vitiated
at
least
in
part
by
the
observation
that
Cynewulf
,
though
he
used
kennings
in
the
traditional
manner
,
was
a
literate
man
who
four
times
inscribed
his
name
by
runes
into
his
works
.
If
Cynewulf
was
literate
,
the
Beowulf
poet
may
have
been
also
,
and
so
may
the
final
redactor
of
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
.
In
lieu
of
the
amanuensis
to
the
blind
or
illiterate
bard
,
one
may
conceive
of
a
man
who
heard
a
vast
store
of
oral
poetry
recited
,
and
became
intimately
familiar
with
the
established
aids
to
poetizing
,
and
himself
wrote
his
own
compositions
or
his
edition
of
the
compositions
of
the
past
.
Other
theories
of
origin
are
compatible
with
the
formulaic
theory
:
Beowulf
may
contain
a
design
for
terror
,
and
The
Iliad
may
have
a
vast
hysteron-proteron
pattern
answering
to
a
ceramic
pattern
produced
during
the
Geometric
Period
in
pottery
.
The
account
of
the
growth
and
final
transcription
of
these
epics
rests
partly
,
however
,
upon
the
degree
to
which
they
were
formulaic
.
Carl
Eduard
Schmidt
counted
1804
different
lines
repeated
exactly
in
the
two
Homeric
poems
,
and
by
increasing
this
figure
so
as
to
include
lines
repeated
with
very
slight
modifications
he
counted
2118
different
lines
used
a
total
of
5612
times
.
Thus
one
line
in
five
from
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
is
to
be
found
somewhere
else
in
the
two
poems
.
The
ratio
is
thoroughly
remarkable
,
because
the
lines
are
so
long
--
half
again
as
long
as
those
of
Beowulf
.
Anglo-Saxon
poetry
appears
to
have
no
comparable
amount
of
repetition
;
;
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
scop
used
and
re-used
whole
lines
and
even
lengthy
passages
after
the
manner
of
his
Homeric
colleague
.
In
determining
the
extent
to
which
any
poem
is
formulaic
it
is
idle
,
however
,
to
inspect
nothing
besides
lines
repeated
in
their
entirety
,
for
a
stock
of
line-fragments
would
be
sufficient
to
permit
the
poet
to
extemporize
with
deftness
if
they
provided
for
prosodic
needs
.
The
closest
scrutiny
is
owed
to
the
Anglo-Saxon
kennings
and
the
Homeric
epithets
;
;
if
any
words
or
phrases
are
formulaic
,
they
will
be
.
The
Iliad
has
two
words
for
the
shield
,
ASPIS
and
SAKOS
.
Recent
criticism
of
Great
Expectations
has
tended
to
emphasize
its
symbolic
and
mythic
content
,
to
show
,
as
M.
D.
Zabel
has
said
of
Dickens
generally
,
that
much
of
the
novel's
impact
resides
in
its
``
allegoric
insight
and
moral
metaphor
''
.
J.
H.
Miller's
excellent
chapter
on
Great
Expectations
has
lately
illustrated
how
fruitfully
that
novel
can
be
read
from
such
a
perspective
.
In
his
analysis
,
however
,
he
touches
upon
but
fails
to
explore
an
idea
,
generally
neglected
in
discussions
of
the
book
,
which
I
believe
is
central
to
its
art
--
the
importance
of
human
hands
as
a
recurring
feature
of
the
narrative
.
This
essay
seeks
to
make
that
exploration
.
Dickens
was
not
for
nothing
the
most
theatrical
of
the
great
Victorian
writers
.
He
knew
instinctively
that
next
to
voice
and
face
an
actor's
hands
are
his
most
useful
possession
--
that
in
fiction
as
in
the
theatre
,
gesture
is
an
indispensable
shorthand
for
individualizing
character
and
dramatizing
action
and
response
.
It
is
hardly
accidental
,
therefore
,
that
many
of
his
most
vivid
figures
do
suggestive
or
eccentric
things
with
their
hands
.
In
Great
Expectations
the
hands
become
almost
an
obsession
.
Mr.
Jaggers
habitually
bites
his
forefinger
,
a
gesture
which
conveys
both
contempt
and
the
inscrutable
abstractedness
that
half
fascinates
,
half
terrifies
all
who
have
dealings
with
him
.
Miss
Havisham's
withered
hands
,
heavy
as
if
her
unhappiness
were
somehow
concentrated
in
them
,
move
in
restless
self-pity
between
her
broken
heart
and
her
walking
stick
.
Pumblechook's
``
signature
''
is
the
perpetually
extended
glad
hand
.
Wemmick
reveals
his
self-satisfaction
by
regularly
rubbing
his
hands
together
.
Old
Mr.
Pocket's
frantic
response
to
life
imprisonment
with
a
useless
,
social-climbing
wife
is
to
``
put
his
two
hands
into
his
disturbed
hair
''
and
``
make
an
extraordinary
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
''
,
whereas
Joe
Gargery
endures
the
shrewish
onslaughts
of
Mrs.
Joe
by
apologetically
drawing
``
the
back
of
his
hand
across
and
across
his
nose
''
.
Such
mannerisms
would
be
less
worthy
of
remark
,
were
it
not
that
in
Great
Expectations
,
as
in
no
other
of
Dickens'
novels
,
hands
serve
as
a
leitmotif
of
plot
and
theme
--
a
kind
of
unifying
symbol
or
natural
metaphor
for
the
book's
complex
of
human
interrelationships
and
the
values
and
attitudes
that
motivate
them
.
Dickens
not
only
reveals
character
through
gesture
,
he
makes
hands
a
crucial
element
of
the
plot
,
a
means
of
clarifying
the
structure
of
the
novel
by
helping
to
define
the
hero's
relations
with
all
the
major
characters
,
and
a
device
for
ordering
such
diverse
themes
as
guilt
,
pursuit
,
crime
,
greed
,
education
,
materialism
,
enslavement
(
by
both
people
and
institutions
)
,
friendship
,
romantic
love
,
forgiveness
,
and
redemption
.
We
have
only
to
think
of
Lady
Macbeth
or
the
policeman-murderer
in
Thomas
Burke's
famous
story
,
``
The
Hands
Of
Mr.
Ottermole
''
,
to
realize
that
hands
often
call
up
ideas
of
crime
and
punishment
.
So
it
is
with
Great
Expectations
,
whether
the
hands
be
Orlick's
as
he
strikes
down
Mrs.
Gargery
or
Pip's
as
he
steals
a
pie
from
her
pantry
.
Such
associations
suit
well
with
the
gothic
or
mystery-story
aspects
of
Dickens'
novel
,
but
,
on
a
deeper
plane
,
they
relate
to
the
themes
of
sin
,
guilt
,
and
pursuit
that
have
recently
been
analyzed
by
other
critics
.
The
novel
opens
with
a
fugitive
convict
frantically
trying
to
avoid
the
nemesis
of
being
``
laid
hands
on
''
--
a
mysterious
figure
who
looks
into
Pip's
frightened
eyes
in
the
churchyard
``
as
if
he
were
eluding
the
hands
of
the
dead
people
,
stretching
up
cautiously
out
of
their
graves
,
to
get
a
twist
upon
his
ankle
and
pull
him
in
''
.
Magwitch
terrifies
Pip
into
stealing
a
pork
pie
for
him
by
creating
the
image
in
the
boy's
imagination
of
a
bogy
man
who
may
``
softly
creep
his
way
to
him
and
tear
him
open
''
,
``
imbruing
his
hands
''
in
him
.
As
Pip
agonizes
over
the
theft
that
his
own
hands
have
committed
,
his
guilty
conscience
projects
itself
upon
the
wooden
finger
of
a
local
signpost
,
transforming
it
into
``
a
phantom
devoting
me
to
the
Hulks
''
.
Held
upside
down
in
the
graveyard
,
Pip
clings
in
terror
``
with
both
hands
''
to
his
convict
;
;
later
he
flees
in
panic
from
the
family
table
just
as
his
theft
is
about
to
be
discovered
and
is
blocked
at
the
front
door
by
a
soldier
who
accusingly
holds
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
which
he
has
brought
to
Gargery's
forge
for
mending
.
Through
such
details
Dickens
indicates
at
the
outset
that
guilt
is
a
part
of
the
ironic
bond
between
Pip
and
Magwitch
which
is
so
unpredictably
to
alter
both
their
lives
.
Since
they
commonly
translate
thoughts
and
feelings
into
deeds
,
hands
naturally
represent
action
,
and
since
nearly
half
the
characters
in
Great
Expectations
are
of
the
underworld
or
closely
allied
to
it
,
the
linking
of
hands
with
crime
or
violence
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
.
Dickens
,
for
excellent
psychological
reasons
,
never
fully
reveals
Magwitch's
felonious
past
,
but
Pip
,
at
the
convict's
climactic
reappearance
in
London
,
shrinks
from
clasping
a
hand
which
he
fears
``
might
be
stained
with
blood
''
.
Orlick
slouches
about
the
forge
``
like
Cain
''
with
``
his
hands
in
his
pockets
''
,
and
when
he
shouts
abuse
at
Mrs.
Joe
for
objecting
to
his
holiday
,
she
claps
her
hands
in
a
tantrum
,
beats
them
``
upon
her
bosom
and
upon
her
knees
''
,
and
clenches
them
in
her
husband's
hair
.
This
last
``
rampage
''
is
only
the
prelude
to
the
vicious
blow
upon
her
head
,
``
dealt
by
some
unknown
hand
''
whose
identity
is
later
revealed
not
verbally
but
through
a
manual
action
--
the
tracing
of
Orlick's
hammer
upon
a
slate
.
Pip
himself
is
to
feel
the
terror
of
Orlick's
``
murderous
hand
''
in
his
secret
rendezvous
at
the
sluicehouse
on
the
marshes
.
Dickens
lays
great
emphasis
on
the
hands
in
this
scene
.
Orlick
shakes
his
hand
at
Pip
,
bangs
the
table
with
his
fist
,
draws
his
unclenched
hand
``
across
his
mouth
as
if
his
mouth
watered
''
for
his
victim
,
lets
his
hands
hang
``
loose
and
heavy
at
his
sides
''
,
and
Pip
observes
him
so
intensely
that
he
knows
``
of
the
slightest
action
of
his
fingers
''
.
Orlick
might
almost
be
Magwitch's
bogy
man
come
alive
,
a
figure
of
nemesis
from
Pip's
phantasy
of
guilt
.
The
scarred
,
disfigured
wrists
of
Mr.
Jaggers'
housekeeper
are
the
tell-tale
marks
of
her
sinister
past
,
for
her
master
,
coolly
exhibiting
them
to
his
dinner
guests
,
makes
a
point
of
the
``
force
of
grip
there
is
in
these
hands
''
.
Jaggers'
iron
control
over
her
(
``
she
would
remove
her
hands
from
any
dish
she
put
before
him
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
dreaded
his
calling
her
back
)
''
)
rests
on
his
having
once
got
her
acquitted
of
a
murder
charge
by
cleverly
contriving
her
sleeves
at
the
trial
to
conceal
her
strength
and
by
passing
off
the
lacerations
on
the
backs
of
her
hands
as
the
scratches
of
brambles
rather
than
of
human
fingernails
.
It
is
the
similarity
between
Estella's
hands
and
Molly's
(
``
The
action
of
her
fingers
was
like
the
action
of
knitting
''
)
that
provides
Pip
with
a
vital
clue
to
the
real
identity
of
both
and
establishes
a
symbolic
connection
between
the
underworld
of
crime
and
the
genteel
cruelty
of
Satis
House
.
Finally
,
Magwitch's
pursuit
of
Compeyson
,
his
archenemy
and
betrayer
,
begins
by
his
holding
him
in
a
vicelike
grip
on
the
river
flats
to
frustrate
his
escape
and
culminates
in
his
``
laying
his
hand
on
his
cloak
to
identify
him
''
,
thus
precipitating
the
death-locked
struggle
in
the
water
during
which
Compeyson
drowns
.
Magwitch's
hand
here
ironically
becomes
the
agent
of
justice
.
But
only
in
one
of
its
aspects
is
Great
Expectations
a
tale
of
violence
,
revenge
,
and
retribution
.
Money
,
so
important
a
theme
elsewhere
in
Dickens
,
is
here
central
,
and
hands
are
often
associated
in
some
way
with
the
false
values
--
acquisitiveness
,
snobbery
,
self-interest
,
hypocrisy
,
toadyism
,
irresponsibility
,
injustice
--
that
attach
to
a
society
based
upon
the
pursuit
of
wealth
.
Dickens
suggests
the
economic
evils
of
such
a
society
on
the
first
page
of
his
novel
in
the
description
of
Pip's
five
little
dead
brothers
``
who
gave
up
trying
to
get
a
living
exceedingly
early
in
that
universal
struggle
''
,
who
seemed
to
have
``
all
been
born
on
their
backs
with
their
hands
in
their
trousers-pockets
,
and
had
never
taken
them
out
in
this
state
of
existence
''
.
Pip's
great
expectations
,
his
progress
through
illusion
and
disillusionment
,
turn
,
somewhat
as
they
do
for
the
naive
hero
of
Dreiser's
American
Tragedy
,
upon
the
lure
of
genteel
prosperity
through
unearned
income
--
what
Wemmick
calls
``
portable
property
''
and
what
Jaggers
reproaches
Pip
for
letting
``
slip
through
(
his
)
fingers
''
.
Since
a
gentleman
must
,
if
possible
,
avoid
sullying
them
by
work
,
his
hands
,
as
importantly
as
his
accent
,
become
the
index
of
social
status
.
Almost
the
first
step
in
the
corruption
of
Pip's
values
is
the
unworthy
shame
he
feels
when
Estella
cruelly
remarks
the
coarseness
of
his
hands
:
``
They
had
never
troubled
me
before
,
but
they
troubled
me
now
,
as
vulgar
appendages
''
.
Pip
imagines
how
Estella
would
look
down
upon
Joe's
hands
,
roughened
by
work
in
the
smithy
,
and
the
deliberate
contrast
between
her
white
hands
and
his
blackened
ones
is
made
to
symbolize
the
opposition
of
values
between
which
Pip
struggles
--
idleness
and
work
,
artificiality
and
naturalness
,
gentility
and
commonness
,
coldness
and
affection
--
in
fact
,
between
Satis
House
and
the
forge
.
When
the
snobbery
that
alienates
Pip
from
Joe
finally
gives
way
before
the
deeper
and
stronger
force
of
love
,
the
reunion
is
marked
by
an
embarrassed
handshake
at
which
Pip
exclaims
:
``
No
,
don't
wipe
it
off
--
for
God's
sake
,
give
me
your
blackened
hand
''
!
!
Pip's
abject
leave-taking
of
Miss
Havisham
,
during
which
he
kneels
to
kiss
her
hand
,
signalizes
his
homage
to
a
supposed
patroness
who
seems
to
be
opening
up
for
him
a
new
world
of
glamour
;
;
when
,
on
the
journey
to
London
that
immediately
follows
,
he
pauses
nostalgically
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
finger-post
at
the
end
of
the
village
,
the
wooden
pointer
symbolically
designates
a
spiritual
frontier
between
innocence
and
the
corruption
of
worldly
vanity
.
Incidentally
,
one
cannot
miss
the
significance
of
this
gesture
,
for
Dickens
reintroduces
it
associatively
in
Pip's
mind
at
another
moral
and
psychological
crisis
--
his
painful
recognition
,
in
a
talk
with
Herbert
Pocket
,
that
his
hopeless
attachment
to
Estella
is
as
self-destructive
as
it
is
romantic
.
In
both
cases
the
finger-post
represents
Pip's
heightened
awareness
of
contrary
magnetisms
.
A
variety
of
hand
movements
helps
dramatize
the
moral
climate
of
the
fallen
world
Pip
encounters
beyond
the
forge
.
The
vulture-like
attendance
of
the
Pocket
family
upon
Miss
Havisham
is
summed
up
in
the
hypocritical
gestures
of
Miss
Camilla
Pocket
,
who
puts
her
hand
to
her
throat
in
a
feigned
spasm
of
grief-stricken
choking
,
then
lays
it
``
upon
her
heaving
bosom
''
with
``
an
unnatural
fortitude
of
manner
''
,
and
finally
kisses
it
to
Miss
Havisham
in
a
parody
of
the
lady's
own
mannerism
toward
Estella
.
Pumblechook's
hands
throughout
the
novel
serve
to
travesty
greed
and
hypocritical
self-aggrandizement
.
We
first
see
him
shaking
Mrs.
Joe's
hand
on
discovering
the
sizable
amount
of
the
premium
paid
to
her
husband
for
Pip's
indenture
as
an
apprentice
and
later
pumping
Pip's
hands
``
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
''
(
``
May
I
--
may
I
--
''
?
?
)
in
effusive
congratulation
to
Pip
on
his
expectations
.
We
take
leave
of
Pumblechook
as
he
gloats
over
Pip's
loss
of
fortune
,
extending
his
hand
``
with
a
magnificently
forgiving
air
''
and
exhibiting
``
the
same
fat
five
fingers
''
,
one
of
which
he
identifies
with
``
the
finger
of
Providence
''
and
shakes
at
Pip
in
a
canting
imputation
of
the
latter's
``
ingratitoode
''
and
his
own
generosity
as
Pip's
``
earliest
benefactor
''
.
Pip
first
learns
``
the
stupendous
power
of
money
''
from
the
sycophantic
tailor
,
Mr.
Trabb
,
whose
brutality
to
his
boy
helper
exactly
matches
the
financial
resource
of
each
new
customer
,
and
whose
fawning
hands
touch
``
the
outside
of
each
elbow
''
and
``
rub
''
Pip
out
of
the
shop
.
The
respectability
which
money
confers
implies
a
different
etiquette
,
and
,
upon
taking
up
the
life
of
a
London
gentleman
,
Pip
must
learn
from
Herbert
Pocket
that
``
the
spoon
is
not
generally
used
over-hand
,
but
under
''
.
The
following
items
may
be
specified
in
actual
or
symbolic

The
declarative

EQU
is
used
to
equate

Continuation
cards
Certain
Autocoder
statements
make
provision
for
more
parameters
than
may
be
contained
in
the
operand
(
columns
21
-
75
)
of
a
single
line
on
the
Autocoder
coding
sheet
.
When
this
is
the
case
,
the
appropriate
section
of
this
manual
will
indicate
that
``
Continuation
Cards
''
may
be
used
.
Thus
,
when
specifically
permitted
,
the
operand
of
a
given
line
on
the
Autocoder
coding
sheet
may
be
continued
in
the
operand
of
from
one
to
four
additional
lines
which
immediately
follow
.
The
label
and
operation
columns
must
be
blank
and
the
continuation
of
the
operand
must
begin
in
column
21
;
;
i.e.
,
it
must
be
left-justified
in
the
operand
column
of
the
coding
sheet
.
The
operand
need
not
extend
across
the
entire
operand
column
of
either
the
header
card
or
continuation
cards
but
may
end
with
the
comma
following
any
parameter
.
Remarks
may
appear
to
the
right
of
the
last
parameter
on
each
card
provided
they
are
separated
from
the
operand
by
at
least
two
blank
spaces
.
Illustrations
of
the
use
of
continuation
cards
are
included
throughout
the
examples
illustrating
the
various
statements
.
If
a
continuation
card
follows
a
statement
that
does
not
permit
continuation
cards
,
the
compiler
will
generate
a
NOP
and
issue
an
error
message
.
Additional
restrictions
regarding
the
use
of
continuation
cards
with
macro-instructions

Reservation
of
index
words
and
electronic
switches
The
assignment
of
actual
addresses
to
symbolic
index
word
and
electronic
switch
names
occurs
in
Phase
3
,
of
the
Autocoder
processor
.
The
initial
availability
of
index
words
and
electronic
switches
is
determined
by
a
table
which
is
included
in
the
Compiler
Systems
Tape
.
This
table
originally
indicates
that
index
words
1
through
96
and
electronic
switches
1
through
30
are
available
for
assignment
to
symbolic
references
;
;
index
words
97
through
99
are
not
available
.
The
initial
setting
of
this
table
may
be
altered
,
however
,
as
described
in
the
7070/7074
Data
Processing
System
Bulletin
``
IBM
7070/7074
Compiler
System
:
Operating
Procedure
''
,
form
Aj
.
During
the
first
pass
of
Phase
3
,
,
references
to
the
actual
addresses
of
index
words
and
electronic
switches
are
collected
and
the
availability
table
is
updated
.
At
the
end
of
this
pass
,
the
table
indicates
which
index
words
and
electronic
switches
are
not
available
for
assignment
to
symbolic
references
.
Both
index
words
and
electronic
switches
may
have
been
made
unavailable
before
the
start
of
assignment
in
one
of
the
following
ways
.
1
.
The
initial
setting
of
the
availability
table
indicated
that
the
index
word
or
electronic
switch
was
not
available
for
assignment
.
2
.
The
one-
or
two-digit
number
of
the
index
word
or
electronic
switch
was
used
in
the
operand
of
a
symbolic
machine
instruction
to
specify
indexing
or
as
a
parameter
which
is
always
an
index
word
or
electronic
switch
,
e.g.
,
3
.
The
one-
or
two-digit
number
of
the
index
word
or
electronic
switch
was
used
in
the
operand
of
an
EQU
statement
,
e.g.
,
When
the
index
words
or
electronic
switches
are
reserved
because
of
actual
usage
in
the
statements
described
above
,
the
position
or
order
of
the
statements
within
the
program
is
not
important
;
;
any
such
reference
will
make
the
index
word
or
electronic
switch
unavailable
at
the
end
of
this
pass
.
During
the
assignment
pass
of
Phase
3
,
,
index
words
and
electronic
switches
are
reserved
as
they
are
encountered
during
assignment
.
Index
words
and
electronic
switches
may
be
reserved
in
the
following
ways
.
The
first
two
methods
apply
to
both
index
words
and
electronic
switches
;
;
the
third
applies
only
to
index
words
.
1
.
During
the
assignment
pass
,
each
instruction
is
examined
for
reference
to
the
symbolic
name
of
an
index
word
or
electronic
switch
.
When
such
a
reference
is
found
,
an
actual
address
is
assigned
and
the
availability
table
is
changed
so
that
the
assigned
index
word
or
switch
is
no
longer
available
for
later
assignment
.
2
.
If
the
one-
or
two-digit
address
of
an
index
word
or
electronic
switch
is
used
or
is
included
in
the
operand
of
an
XRESERVE
or
SRESERVE
statement
(
see
page
99
)
,
the
corresponding
index
word
or
electronic
switch
is
reserved
.
3
.
If
a
statement
has
been
assigned
an
address
in
the
index
word
area
by
means
of
an
actual
label
or
by
means
of
an
origin
statement
which
refers
to
an
actual
address
,
the
corresponding
index
word
will
be
reserved
.
These
entries
should
normally
appear
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
or
immediately
following
each
LITORIGIN
statement
.
Otherwise
,
symbolic
names
may
have
previously
been
assigned
to
these
same
index
words
.
(
This
method
does
not
apply
to
electronic
switches
.
)
The
preceding
methods
allow
efficient
use
of
index
words
and
electronic
switches
during
a
sectionalized
or
multi-phase
program
,
particularly
when
used
in
conjunction
with
the
LITORIGIN
statement
.
Extreme
caution
should
be
used
,
however
,
to
avoid
the
conflicting
usage
of
an
index
word
or
electronic
switch
which
may
result
from
the
assignment
of
more
than
one
name
or
function
to
the
same
address
.
If
the
symbolic
name
or
actual
address
of
an
index
word
or
electronic
switch
appears
or
is
included
in
the
operand
of
an
XRELEASE
or
SRELEASE
statement
(
see
page
101
)
,
the
specified
index
word
or
electronic
switch
will
again
be
made
available
,
regardless
of
the
method
by
which
it
was
reserved
.
It
will
not
,
however
,
be
used
for
symbolic
assignment
until
all
other
index
words
or
electronic
switches
have
been
assigned
for
the
first
time
.
If
,
at
any
time
during
the
assignment
pass
,
the
compiler
finds
that
there
are
no
more
index
words
available
for
assignment
,
the
warning
message
``
No
More
Index
Words
Available
''
will
be
placed
in
the
object
program
listing
,
the
table
will
be
altered
to
show
that
index
words
1
through
96
are
available
,
and
the
assignment
will
continue
as
before
.
If
the
compiler
finds
that
there
are
no
more
electronic
switches
available
for
assignment
,
the
warning
message
``
No
More
Electronic
Switches
Available
''
will
be
placed
in
the
object
program
listing
,
the
table
will
be
altered
to
show
that
electronic
switches
1
through
30
are
available
,
and
assignment
will
continue
as
before
.
The
resultant
conflicting
usage
of
index
words
or
electronic
switches
may
be
avoided
by
reducing
the
number
of
symbolic
names
used
,
e.g.
,
through
the
proper
use
of
the
EQU
,
XRELEASE
,
or
SRELEASE
statements
.
As
noted
in
Appendix
C
,
index
words
97
through
99
are
never
available
for
assignment
to
symbolic
names
by
the
compiler
;
;
also
,
index
words
93
through
96
may
have
been
made
unavailable
for
assignment
.
Declarative
statements
Autocoder
declarative
statements
provide
the
processor
with
the
necessary
information
to
complete
the
imperative
operations
properly
.
Declarative
statements
are
never
executed
in
the
object
program
and
should
be
separated
from
the
program
instruction
area
,
placed
preferably
at
its
beginning
or
end
.
Otherwise
,
special
care
must
be
taken
to
branch
around
them
so
that
the
program
will
not
attempt
to
execute
something
in
a
data
area
as
an
instruction
.
If
the
compiler
does
encounter
such
statements
,
a
warning
message
will
be
issued
.
7070/7074
Autocoder
includes
the
following
declarative
statements
:
DA
(
Define

)
,
DC
(
Define

)
,
DRDW
(
Define

,
CODE,DTF
(

,
DIOCS
(

)
,
and
DUF
(
Descriptive
Entry
For
Unit

)
.
DA
,
DC
,
DTF
,
and
DLINE
require
more
than
one
entry
.
The
DA
statement
is
used
to
name
and
define
the
positions
and
length
of
fields
within
an
area
.
The
DC
statement
is
used
to
name
and
enter
constants
into
the
object
program
.
Since
the
7070
and
7074
make
use
of
record
definition
words
(
RDWS
)
to
read
,
write
,
move
,
and
otherwise
examine
blocks
of
storage
,
the
DA
and
DC
statements
provide
the
option
of
generating
RDWS
automatically
.
When
so
instructed
,
Autocoder
will
generate
one
or
more
RDWS
and
assign
them
successive
locations
immediately
preceding
the
area
with
which
they
are

In
the
Midwest
,
oxidation
ponds
are
used
extensively
for
the
treatment
of
domestic
sewage
from
suburban
areas
.
The
high
cost
of
land
and
a
few
operational
problems
resulting
from
excessive
loadings
have
created
the
need
for
a
wastewater
treatment
system
with
the
operational
characteristics
of
the
oxidation
pond
but
with
the
ability
to
treat
more
organic
matter
per
unit
volume
.
Research
at
Fayette
,
Missouri
on
oxidation
ponds
has
shown
that
the
BOD
in
the
treated
effluent
varied
from
30
to
53
mg/l
with
loadings
from
8
to
120
lb
.
Since
experience
indicates
that
effluents
from
oxidation
ponds
do
not
create
major
problems
at
these
BOD
concentrations
,
the
goal
for
the
effluent
quality
of
the
accelerated
treatment
system
was
the
same
as
from
conventional
oxidation
ponds
.
Recent
studies
by
Weston
and
Stack
had
indicated
that
a
turbine
aerator
could
be
added
to
an
oxidation
pond
to
increase
the
rate
of
oxygen
transfer
.
Their
study
showed
that
it
was
possible
to
transfer
3
to
4
lb
of
oxygen
/
hr.
/
hp.
.
O'Connor
and
Eckenfelder
discussed
the
use
of
aerated
lagoons
for
treating
organic
wastes
.
They
indicated
that
a
4-day
retention
,
aerated
lagoon
would
give
60
to
76
per
cent
BOD
reduction
.
Later
,
Eckenfelder
increased
the
efficiency
of
treatment
to
between
75
and
85
per
cent
in
the
summer
months
.
It
appeared
from
the
limited
information
available
that
the
aerated
lagoon
might
offer
a
satisfactory
means
of
increasing
the
capacity
of
existing
oxidation
ponds
as
well
as
providing
the
same
degree
of
treatment
in
a
smaller
volume
.
Red
Bridge
Subdivision
With
the
development
of
the
Red
Bridge
Subdivision
south
of
Kansas
City
,
Missouri
,
the
developer
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
providing
adequate
sewage
disposal
.
The
sewage
system
from
Kansas
City
was
not
expected
to
serve
the
Red
Bridge
area
for
several
years
.
This
necessitated
the
construction
of
temporary
sewage
treatment
facilities
with
an
expected
life
from
5
to
15
Aj
.
For
the
initial
development
an
oxidation
pond
was
constructed
as
shown
in
Figure
1
.
The
oxidation
pond
has
a
surface
area
of
4.77
acres
and
a
depth
of
4
Aj
.
The
pond
is
currently
serving
1,230
persons
or
260
persons
per
acre
.
In
the
summer
of
1960
the
oxidation
pond
became
completely
septic
and
emitted
obnoxious
odors
.
It
was
possible
to
maintain
aerobic
conditions
in
the
pond
by
regular
additions
of
sodium
nitrate
until
the
temperature
decreased
and
the
algae
population
changed
from
blue-green
to
green
algae
.
The
anaerobic
conditions
in
the
existing
oxidation
pond
necessitated
examination
of
other
methods
for
supplying
additional
oxygen
than
by
sodium
nitrate
.
At
the
same
time
further
expansion
in
the
Red
Bridge
Subdivision
required
the
construction
of
additional
sewage
treatment
facilities
.
The
large
land
areas
required
for
oxidation
ponds
made
this
type
of
treatment
financially
unattractive
to
the
developer
.
It
was
proposed
that
aerated
lagoons
be
used
to
eliminate
the
problem
at
the
existing
oxidation
ponds
and
to
provide
the
necessary
treatment
for
the
additional
development
.
Pilot
lagoon
The
lack
of
adequate
data
on
the
aerated
lagoon
system
prompted
the
developer
to
construct
an
aerated
lagoon
pilot
plant
to
determine
its
feasibility
for
treating
domestic
sewage
.
The
pilot
plant
was
a
circular
lagoon
81
ft
in
diam
at
the
surface
and
65
ft
in
diam
at
the
bottom
,
4
ft
below
the
surface
,
with
a
volume
of
121,000
Aj
.
The
side
slopes
were
coated
with
fiberglas
matting
coated
with
asphalt
to
prevent
erosion
.
The
pilot
lagoon
was
located
as
shown
in
Figure
1
to
serve
the
area
just
south
of
the
existing
housing
area
.
The
major
contributor
was
a
shopping
center
with
houses
being
added
to
the
system
as
the
subdivision
developed
.
The
pilot
lagoon
was
designed
to
handle
the
wastes
from
314
persons
with
a
4-day
aeration
period
.
Initially
,
the
wastewater
would
be
entirely
from
the
shopping
center
with
the
domestic
sewage
from
the
houses
increasing
over
an
18-month
period
.
This
operation
would
permit
evaluation
of
the
pilot
plant
,
with
a
slowly
increasing
load
,
over
a
reasonable
period
of
time
.
The
pilot
plant
was
equipped
with
a
3-hp.
turbine
aerator
(
Figure
2
)
.
The
aerator
had
a
variable-speed
drive
to
permit
operation
through
a
range
of
speeds
.
The
sewage
flow
into
the
treatment
plant
was
metered
and
continuously
recorded
on
24-hr.
charts
.
The
raw
sewage
was
introduced
directly
under
the
turbine
aerator
to
insure
maximum
mixing
of
the
raw
sewage
with
the
aeration
tank
contents
.
The
effluent
was
collected
through
two
pipes
and
discharged
to
the
Blue
River
through
a
surface
drainage
ditch
.
Analyses
Composite
samples
were
collected
at
weekly
intervals
.
The
long
retention
period
and
the
complete
mixing
concept
prevented
rapid
changes
in
either
the
mixed
liquor
or
in
the
effluent
.
Weekly
samples
would
make
any
changes
more
readily
discernible
than
daily
samples
.
The
composite
samples
were
normally
collected
over
a
6-hr.

A

indicated

were
typical
.
Pilot
plant
operations
The
BOD
of
the
influent
to
the
pilot
plant
varied
between
110
and
710
mg/l
with
an
average
of
350
Aj
.
This
was
equivalent
to
240
mg/lBOD
on
a
24-hr.
basis
.
The
BOD
of
the
raw
sewage
was
typical
of
domestic
sewage
from
a
subdivision
.
The
BOD
in
the
effluent
averaged
58
mg/l
,
a
76-per-cent
reduction
over
the
24-hr.
period
.
Examination
of
the
data
in
Table
1
,
shows
that
a
few
samples
contributed
to
raising
the
effluent
Aj
.
The
periods
of
high
effluent
BOD
occurred
during
cold
periods
when
operational
problems
with
the
aerator
resulted
.
Ice
caused
the
aerator
to
overload
,
straining
the
drive
belts
.
The
slippage
of
the
drive
belts
caused
the
aerator
to
slow
down
and
reduce
oxygen
transfer
as
well
as
the
mixing
of
the
raw
sewage
.
The
organic
loading
on
the
unit
averaged
32
lb
of
BOD/day
or
about
2
lb
BOD/day/1,000
cu
ft
aeration
capacity
.
Needless
to
say
,
the
organic
load
was
very
low
on
a
volumetric
basis
,
but
was
270
lb
BOD/day/acre
on
a
surface
loading
basis
.
It
seems
that
the
aerated
lagoon
was
a
very
heavily
loaded
oxidation
pond
or
a
lightly
loaded
activated
sludge
system
.
The
flow
rate
remained
relatively
constant
during
the
winter
months
as
shown
in
Table
1
.
With
the
spring
rains
the
flow
rose
rapidly
due
to
infiltration
in
open
sewers
.
As
construction
progresses
,
the
volume
of
storm
drainage
will
be
sharply
reduced
.
The
retention
period
in
the
aerated
lagoon
ranged
from
9.8
to
2.6
days
,
averaging
6.4
days
.
The
large
amount
of
vegetable
grindings
from
the
grocery
store
in
the
shopping
center
created
a
suspended
solids
problem
.
The
vegetables
were
not
readily
metabolized
by
the
bacteria
in
the
aeration
unit
and
tended
to
float
on
the
surface
.
A
skimming
device
at
the
effluent
weir
prevented
loss
of
most
of
these
light
solids
.
The
average
volatile
suspended
solids
in
the
effluent
was
75
mg/l
while
MLSS
averaged
170
mg/l
volatile
suspended
solids
.
The
average
sludge
age
based
on
displacement
of
solids
was
calculated
to
be
14.5
days
.
The
oxygen
uptake
rate
in
the
mixed
liquor
averaged
0.8
mg/l/hr
during
the
first
four
months
of
this
study
.
Variations
in
aerator
speeds
during
the
latter
two
months
of
this
study
caused
increased
mixing
and
increased
oxygen
demand
.
The
increase
in
oxygen
uptake
rates
from
1.2
to
2.6
mg/l/hr
which
followed
an
increase
in
rotor
speed
was
believed
to
be
related
to
resuspension
of
solids
which
had
settled
at
the
lower
rotor
speeds
.
It
appeared
that
most
of
the
mixed
liquor
suspended
solids
were
active
microbial
solids
with
the
heavier
,
less
active
solids
settling
out
.
The
suspended
solids
discharged
in
the
effluent
were
found
to
be
the
major
source
of
the
Aj
.
Removal
of
the
suspended
solids
by
a
membrane
filter
yielded
an
average
effluent
containing
only
20
mg/l
Aj
.
The
BOD
in
the
drainage
ditch
receiving
the
pilot
plant
effluent
averaged
12
Aj
.
This
low
BOD
was
due
to
removal
of
the
excess
suspended
solids
by
sedimentation
since
the
only
dilution
was
surface
runoff
which
was
very
low
during
this
study
.
Microscopic
examination
Routine
microscopic
examinations
were
made
of
the
mixed
liquor
as
indicated
by
McKinney
and
Gram
for
the
various
types
of
protozoa
.
It
was
found
that
the
aerated
lagoon
was
an
activated
sludge
system
rather
than
an
oxidation
pond
.
At
no
time
were
algae
found
in
the
mixed
liquor
.
The
bacteria
formed
typical
activated
sludge
floc
.
The
floc
particles
were
all
small
as
the
heavier
floc
settled
out
.
Initially
,
the
flagellated
protozoa
predominated
,
but
they
soon
gave
way
to
the
free
swimming
ciliated
protozoa
.
As
the
temperature
decreased
,
the
number
of
free
swimming
ciliated
protozoa
decreased
.
Very
little
protozoa
activity
existed
below
40-degrees-F
.
When
the
temperature
reached
32-degrees-F
all
protozoan
activity
ceased
;
;
but
as
the
temperature
rose
,
the
numbers
of
protozoa
increased
rapidly
.
Only
once
were
stalked
ciliates
found
in
the
mixed
liquor
.
The
predomination
of
free
swimming
ciliated
protozoa
is
indicative
of
a
high
bacterial
population
.
Oxygen
transfer
One
of
the
important
aspects
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
oxygen
transfer
relationships
of
the
mechanical
aerator
.
Routine
determinations
were
made
for
dissolved
oxygen
in
the
mixed
liquor
and
for
oxygen
uptake
rates
.
The
data
given
in
Table
2
,
show
the
routine
operation
of
the
aerator
.
The
dissolved
oxygen
in
the
aeration
unit
was
consistently
high
until
January
29
,
1961
.
An
extended
cold
spell
caused
ice
to
build
up
on
the
aerator
which
was
mounted
on
a
floating
platform
and
caused
the
entire
platform
to
sink
lower
in
the
water
.
The
added
resistance
to
the
rotor
damaged
the
drive
belts
and
reduced
the
oxygen
transfer
capacity
.
It
was
approximately
one
month
before
the
belt
problem
was
noticed
and
corrected
,
but
at
no
time
was
there
a
deficiency
of
dissolved
oxygen
.
A
series
of
eight
special
tests
were
conducted
at
different
rotor
speeds
to
determine
the
oxygen
transfer
rate
.
Five
of
the
tests
were
conducted
with
a
polyethylene
cover
to
simulate
an
ice
cover
.
The

of

dissolved
oxygen
concentration
and

is
given
in
Table

.
The
maximum
rate
of

1.0
mg/l
dissolved
oxygen
was
calculated
as
220
lb/day
at
a

of
9.3
Aj
.
The
actual

indicated

.
The
polyethylene
cover
reduced
the
oxygen
transfer
rate
by
10
per

,
indicating
that
the
maximum
oxygen
transfer
is
at
the

rather
than
through

.
Oxidation
pond
During
this
study
septic
conditions
developed
in
the
oxidation
pond
in
the
spring
when
the
ice
melted
.
Shortly
after
this
study
ended
septic
conditions
resulted
which
required
the
addition
of
sodium
nitrate
.
The
location
of
the
oxidation
pond
in
a
high-value
residential
area
makes
odor
nuisances
a
sensitive
problem
for
the
developer
.
The
organic
concentration
in
the
influent
raw
sewage
ranged
from
160
to
270
mg/l
of
BOD
with
an
average
of
230
Aj
.
The
BOD
data
are
given
in
Table
4
.
A
single
24-hr.
composite
sample
had
a
BOD
of
260
mg/l
,
indicating
a
typical
domestic
sewage
.
The
daily
sewage
volume
to
the
oxidation
pond
averaged
147,000
gpd
,
giving
a
retention
period
of
42
days
.
The
organic
loading
on
the
pond
was
slightly
under
60
lb.
BOD
/
day
/
acre
.
The
effluent
BOD
averaged
34
mg/l
,
a
little
lower
than
that
of
the
study
at
Fayette
indicated
for
a
loading
of
60
lb.
Aj
.
The
BOD
of
the
effluent
ranged
from
a
minimum
of
13
to
a
maximum
of
47
mg.
/
l.
.
Microscopic
examination
of
the
effluent
showed
that
minimum
BOD
occurred
when
the
algae
began
to
decrease
with
cold
weather
.
When
the
algae
began
to
build
up
again
,
the
effluent
BOD
rose
.
During
the
two
weeks
when
the
algae
disappeared
from
the
effluent
BOD's
in
the
effluent
were
18
and
16
Aj
.
Thus
,
the
three
main
categories
of
antisubmarine
warfare
operations
are
defense
of
shipping
,
defense
of
naval
forces
,
and
area
defense
.
The
last
category
overlaps
the
others
in
amphibious
operations
and
near
terminals
and
bases
.
To
effect
these
operations
,
five
elements
exist
(
1
)
surface
,
(
2
)
air
,
(
3
)
mines
,
(
4
)
submarine
,
and
(
5
)
fixed
installations
.
Surface
forces
have
been
used
to
provide
defense
zones
around
naval
and
merchant
ship
formations
,
air
to
furnish
area
surveillance
,
and
mines
for
protection
of
limited
areas
.
Submarines
and
shore
installations
are
new
elements
.
The
submarine
now
has
a
definite
place
in
submarine
defense
particularly
in
denying
enemy
access
to
ocean
areas
.
Fixed
installations
offer
possibilities
for
area
detection
.
Mine
warfare
is
being
reoriented
against
submarine
targets
.
A
sixth
element
,
not
always
considered
,
is
intelligence
.
It
includes
operational
intelligence
of
the
enemy
and
knowledge
of
the
environment
.
Operational
intelligence
presumably
will
be
available
from
our
national
intelligence
agencies
;
;
intelligence
on
the
environment
will
come
from
the
recently
augmented
program
in
oceanography
.
The
major
postwar
development
is
the
certainty
that
these
elements
should
not
be
considered
singly
but
in
combination
and
as
being
mutually
supporting
.
Necessity
for
an
over-all
concept
Thinking
on
submarine
defense
has
not
always
been
clear-cut
.
Proponents
of
single
elements
tend
to
ensure
predominance
of
that
element
without
determining
if
it
is
justified
,
and
the
element
with
the
most
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
proponents
has
assumed
the
greatest
importance
.
Consequently
,
air
,
surface
,
and
submarine
elements
overshadow
the
mine
,
fixed
installations
,
and
intelligence
.
These
have
sought
more
and
more
of
what
they
have
.
Each
seems
to
strive
for
elimination
of
the
necessity
for
the
others
.
This
,
despite
postwar
experience
demonstrating
that
all
elements
are
necessarily
mutually
supporting
.
Thus
,
the
most
productive
areas
are
not
necessarily
the
most
stressed
.
This
is
stated
to
emphasize
the
necessity
for
an
over-all
concept
of
submarine
defense
,
one
which
would
provide
positions
of
relative
importance
to
ASW
elements
based
on
projected
potentialities
.
Then
the
enthusiasm
and
energy
of
all
elements
can
be
channeled
to
produce
cumulative
progress
toward
a
common
objective
.
An
over-all
concept
would
have
other
advantages
.
It
would
allow
presentation
to
the
public
of
a
unified
approach
.
Now
the
problem
is
presented
piecemeal
and
sometimes
contradictorily
.
While
one
element
is
announcing
progress
,
another
is
delineating
its
problems
.
The
result
can
only
be
confusion
in
the
public
mind
.
A
unified
concept
can
serve
as
a
guide
to
budgeting
and
,
if
public
support
is
gained
,
will
command
Congressional
support
.
Industry's
main
criticism
of
the
Navy's
antisubmarine
effort
is
that
it
cannot
determine
where
any
one
company
or
industry
can
apply
its
skills
and
know-how
.
Lacking
guidance
,
industry
picks
its
own
areas
.
The
result
,
coupled
with
the
salesmanship
for
which
American
industry
is
famous
,
is
considerable
expenditure
of
funds
and
efforts
in
marginal
areas
.
An
over-all
concept
will
guide
industry
where
available
talents
and
facilities
will
yield
greatest
dividends
.
Therefore
,
a
broad
concept
of
over-all
submarine
defense
is
needed
for
co-ordination
of
the
Navy's
efforts
,
for
a
logical
presentation
to
the
public
,
for
industry's
guidance
,
and
as
a
basis
for
a
program
to
the
Congress
.
Principles
involved
in
an
over-all
concept
That
which
follows
will
be
a
discussion
of
principles
and
possible
content
for
an
over-all
concept
of
antisubmarine
warfare
.
Russia
possesses
the
preponderance
of
submarines
in
the
world
,
divided
between
her
various
fleets
.
Some
are
also
in
Albania
and
others
are
on
loan
to
Egypt
.
Other
countries
which
may
willingly
or
unwillingly
become
Communist
can
furnish
bases
.
Communist
target
areas
can
be
assumed
,
but
there
is
no
certainty
that
such
assumptions
coincide
with
Soviet
intentions
.
Attack
can
come
from
almost
any
direction
against
many
locations
.
Logically
,
then
,
the
first
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
is
not
rigidly
oriented
toward
any
geographical
area
.
It
is
often
stated
that
the
submarine
can
be
destroyed
while
building
,
at
bases
,
in
transit
,
and
on
station
.
Destruction
of
the
enemy's
building
and
base
complex
,
however
,
requires
attacks
on
enemy
territory
,
which
is
possible
only
in
event
of
all-out
hostilities
.
In
transit
or
on
station
,
it
may
not
be
possible
to
attack
the
submarines
until
commission
of
an
overt
act
.
The
Communists
are
adept
at
utilizing
hostilities
short
of
general
war
and
will
do
so
whenever
it
is
to
their
advantage
.
Therefore
the
second
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
,
while
providing
for
all-out
hostilities
,
its
effectiveness
is
not
dependent
on
general
war
.
Antisubmarine
warfare
does
not
involve
clashes
between
large
opposing
forces
,
with
the
decision
a
result
of
a
single
battle
.
It
is
a
war
of
attrition
,
of
single
actions
,
of
an
exchange
of
losses
.
This
exchange
must
result
in
our
ending
up
with
some
effective
units
.
Initially
,
having
fewer
units
of
some
elements
--
especially
submarines
--
than
the
opponent
,
our
capabilities
need
to
be
sufficiently
greater
than
theirs
,
so
that
the
exchange
will
be
in
our
favor
.
Therefore
,
the
third
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
does
not
depend
for
effectiveness
on
engagement
by
the
same
types
,
unless
at
an
assured
favorable
exchange
rate
.
The
submarine
has
increased
its
effectiveness
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
since
World
War
2
.
Its
speed
has
increased
,
it
operates
at
increasingly
greater
depths
,
its
submerged
endurance
is
becoming
unlimited
,
and
it
will
become
even
more
silent
.
The
next
developments
will
probably
be
in
weaponry
.
The
missile
can
gradually
be
expected
to
replace
the
torpedo
.
As
detection
ranges
increase
,
weapons
will
be
developed
to
attack
other
submarines
and
surface
craft
at
these
ranges
.
Therefore
,
the
fourth
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
provide
for
continuously
increasing
capabilities
in
the
opponent
.
No
element
can
accomplish
the
total
objective
of
submarine
defense
.
Some
elements
support
the
others
,
but
all
have
limitations
.
Some
limitations
of
one
element
can
be
compensated
for
by
a
capability
of
another
.
Elements
used
in
combination
will
increase
the
over-all
capability
more
than
the
sum
of
the
capabilities
of
the
individual
elements
.
Therefore
,
the
plan's
fifth
principle
must
be
that
it
capitalize
on
the
capabilities
of
all
elements
in
combination
.
Conceivably
the
submarine
defense
problem
can
be
solved
by
sufficient
forces
.
Numbers
would
be
astronomical
and
current
fiscal
policies
make
this
an
impractical
solution
.
Shipbuilding
,
aircraft
procurement
,
and
weapon
programs
indicate
that
there
will
not
be
enough
of
anything
.
Therefore
,
any
measures
taken
in
peacetime
which
will
decrease
force
requirements
in
war
will
contribute
greatly
to
success
when
hostilities
occur
.
Therefore
,
the
sixth
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
concentrate
on
current
measures
which
will
reduce
future
force
requirements
.
The
world
is
constantly
changing
;
;
what
was
new
yesterday
is
obsolescent
today
.
The
seventh
principle
of
the
plan
is
self-evident
;
;
it
must
be
flexible
enough
to
allow
for
technological
breakthroughs
,
scientific
progress
,
and
changes
in
world
conditions
.
Supporting
elements
in
asw
operations
To
this
point
the
need
for
an
over-all
plan
for
submarine
defense
has
been
demonstrated
,
the
mission
has
been
stated
,
broad
principles
delineating
its
content
laid
down
,
and
the
supporting
elements
listed
.
Before
considering
these
elements
in
more
detail
,
an
additional
requirement
should
be
stated
.
Large
area
coverage
will
accomplish
all
other
tasks
.
Therefore
,
because
reduction
in
tasks
results
in
reduction
of
forces
required
,
the
plan
should
provide
for
expanding
area
coverage
.
But
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
plan
should
not
be
oriented
geographically
.
Consequently
,
the
system
giving
area
coverage
(
if
such
coverage
is
less
than
world
wide
)
must
be
flexible
and
hence
at
least
partially
mobile
.
Since
effective
area
coverage
appears
fairly
remote
,
the
requirement
can
be
borne
in
mind
while
considering
the
elements
:
air
,
surface
,
sub-surface
,
fixed
installations
,
mines
,
and
intelligence
.
These
are
arranged
approximately
in
the
order
of
the
vociferousness
of
their
proponents
but
will
be
discussed
in
the
reverse
order
in
the
hope
that
the
true
order
of
importance
will
result
.
Intelligence
,
as
used
herein
,
will
include
information
on
possible
opponents
and
on
the
environment
which
can
affect
operations
.
These
can
be
referred
to
as
operational
intelligence
and
environmental
intelligence
.
In
submarine
defense
these
must
have
maximum
stress
.
Good
operational
intelligence
can
ensure
sound
planning
,
greatly
reduce
force
requirements
,
and
increase
tactical
effectiveness
.
Environmental
intelligence
is
just
as
important
.
The
ocean
presently
co-operates
with
the
target
.
Full
knowledge
of
the
science
of
oceanography
can
bring
the
environment
to
our
side
,
resulting
in
an
increase
in
effectiveness
of
equipment
and
tactics
,
a
decrease
in
enemy
capabilities
,
and
the
development
of
methods
of
capitalizing
on
the
environment
.
Therefore
,
improved
intelligence
will
result
in
reduced
force
requirements
and
,
as
it
supports
all
other
elements
,
rates
a
top
priority
.
Gathering
intelligence
is
important
,
but
of
equal
importance
is
its
translation
into
usable
form
.
A
program
is
needed
to
translate
the
results
of
oceanographic
research
into
tactical
and
operating
instructions
.
Approaching
this
problem
on
a
statistical
basis
is
invalid
,
because
the
opponent
has
the
same
sources
available
and
will
be
encountered
not
under
average
conditions
,
but
under
the
conditions
most
advantageous
to
him
.
Therefore
,
the
on-the-scene
commander
must
have
detailed
operating
instructions
based
on
measurement
of
conditions
,
in
the
area
,
at
the
time
of
encounter
.
All
capabilities
must
be
used
to
maximum
advantage
then
.
Temperature
,
wind
,
oxygen
content
,
depth
,
bottom
character
,
and
animal
life
are
the
chief
environmental
variables
.
There
may
be
others
.
Variations
in
sound
velocity
should
be
measured
rather
than
temperature
,
because
more
of
the
variables
would
be
encompassed
.
These
variations
must
eventually
be
measured
horizontally
as
well
as
vertically
.
Progress
in
predicting
water
conditions
is
encouraging
,
but
little
guidance
is
available
to
the
man
at
sea
on
the
use
of
such
information
.
A
concurrent
effort
is
needed
to
make
oceanographic
data
useful
on
the
spot
.
Mine
warfare
has
in
the
past
been
directed
against
surface
targets
.
By
its
nature
it
has
always
been
of
great
psychological
advantage
and
small
efforts
have
required
considerably
greater
counter-efforts
.
Mines
are
being
increasingly
oriented
against
submarine
targets
.
They
are
still
considered
to
be
for
use
in
restricted
waters
,
however
,
and
targets
must
come
within
a
few
yards
of
them
.
Mines
need
to
be
recognized
as
a
major
element
in
anti-submarine
warfare
employment
,
extended
to
deep
water
,
and
have
their
effective
area
per
unit
increased
.
Mines
can
be
used
to
deny
access
to
great
areas
;
;
they
are
difficult
to
counter
,
cost
little
to
maintain
until
required
,
and
can
be
put
into
place
quickly
.
A
most
attractive
feature
is
that
detection
and
attack
are
combined
in
a
single
package
.
Effective
employment
will
reduce
force
requirements
.
For
example
,
effective
mine
barriers
from
Florida
to
Cuba
and
across
the
Yucatan
Channel
from
Cuba
to
Mexico
would
remove
all
requirements
for
harbor
defense
,
inshore
patrol
,
convoy
escort
,
shipping
control
,
and
mine
defense
for
the
entire
Gulf
of
Mexico
.
More
extended
systems
,
covering
all
passage
into
the
Caribbean
,
would
free
the
Caribbean
and
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
the
previously
listed
requirements
.
Systems
covering
the
Gulf
of
St.
Lawrence
and
possibly
the
entire
coasts
of
the
United
States
are
not
impossible
.
Such
mine
defense
systems
could
permit
concentration
of
mobile
forces
in
the
open
oceans
with
consequent
increase
in
the
probability
of
success
.
The
advantages
inherent
in
mine
warfare
justify
as
great
an
importance
for
this
element
as
is
accorded
any
of
the
other
elements
.
Fixed
installations
are
increasingly
advocated
as
the
problem
of
area
defense
emerges
.
The
proponents
are
scientific
and
technical
men
who
exercise
considerable
influence
on
their
military
counterparts
.
Systems
which
detect
submarines
over
wide
areas
are
attractive
,
although
they
can
be
only
``
burglar
alarms
''
.
Mobile
forces
are
required
to
localize
and
attack
detected
targets
,
since
the
systems
are
not
capable
of
pinpointing
a
target
.
Such
systems
are
expensive
and
are
oriented
geographically
.
In
an
over-all
ASW
concept
,
dependence
on
and
effort
expended
for
such
systems
should
be
limited
to
those
with
proven
capabilities
.
No
general
installation
should
be
made
until
a
model
installation
has
been
proved
and
its
maximum
capability
determined
.
In
addition
,
proposals
for
fixed
installations
should
be
carefully
weighed
against
a
counterpart
mobile
system
.
Fixed
installations
will
always
lack
the
flexibility
that
should
be
inherent
in
naval
systems
.
The
submarine
has
become
increasingly
attractive
as
an
antisubmarine
weapon
system
.
It
operates
in
its
target's
environment
,
and
any
advantage
gained
therefrom
by
the
target
is
shared
by
the
attacker
.
But
the
submarine
is
a
weapon
of
ambush
and
therefore
always
in
danger
of
being
ambushed
.

studies
on
esterases
--
Research
on
esterases
in
mammalian
sera
was
continued
.
One
of
the
most
interesting
findings
was
the
extreme
sensitivity
of
plasma
arylesterases
to
rare
earth
ions
.
The
inhibition
of
the
enzyme
by
very
low
concentrations
of
lanthanum
ion
is
probably
the
strongest
known
biological
effect
of
rare
earth
salts
.
Various
metal
ions
have
been
found
to
protect
plasma
arylesterase
against
inactivation
by
urea
and
guanidine
.
The
effects
can
be
related
to
the
structure
of
this
enzyme
.
The
non-identity
of
serum
and
red
blood
cell
arylesterase
was
also
established
.
Furthermore
,
the
hydrolysis
of
paraoxon
was
studied
in
mammalian
sera
,
and
it
was
found
that
it
is
hydrolyzed
by
albumin
(
or
a
factor
attached
to
it
)
in
addition
to
arylesterase
.
Selective
inhibitors
can
distinguish
the
two
activities
.

acceleration
of
human
plasma
cholinesterase

On

it

,
for

by
a

of

valid
when

By

geochemistry
trace
elements
in
tektites
,
meteorites
,
and
related
materials
--
The
results
of
microanalysis
of
tektites
(
natural
glasses
of
unknown
origin
)
for
gallium
and
germanium
have
shown
that
these
glasses
are
probably
produced
from
terrestrial
(
or
less
likely
from
lunar
)
matter
by
impact
of
a
celestial
body
.
The
gallium
/
germanium
ratio
is
higher
than
that
for
ordinary
igneous
,
metamorphic
,
or
sedimentary
matter
as
a
result
of
selective
volatilization
of
the
components
of
the
tektite
.
Gallium
oxide
is
less
volatile
than
silica
(
the
main
constituent
of
tektites
)
and
germanium
oxide
is
more
volatile
.
Australites
(
tektites
from
Australia
)
give
the
appearance
of
a
second
melting
.
In
conformity
with
this
conclusion
a
higher
trace
gallium
content
was
found
in
the
portion
(
flange
)
that
has
undergone
a
second
melting
.
The
silicate
fractions
of
stony
meteorites
show
gallium
/
germanium
ratios
similar
to
those
of
tektites
because
they
too
have
undergone
melting
at
some
point
in
their
histories
.
Libyan

silica-glass
,
another
natural
glass
,
is
composed
of
nearly
pure
silica
and
has
the
same
trace
germanium
content
as
sands
in
the
area
.
The
gallium
content
,
however
,
has
been
enhanced
five-fold
.
This
glass
is
probably
formed
from
Libyan
Desert
sands
by
comet
or
stony-meteorite
impact
.
Nickel-iron
meteorites
with
sufficient
kinetic
energy
to
produce
large
terrestrial
explosion
craters
may
nevertheless
melt
only
small
quantities
of
material
.
Most
of
the
impact
energy
is
spent
in
crushing
and
fragmentation
.
When
rapid
quenching
follows
melting
,
impact
glasses
may
result
.
These
always
contain
metallic
inclusions
.
Impact
glasses
not
containing
elemental
nickel-iron
may
have
been
produced
by
stony
meteorites
or
comets
.
No
meteorites
have
ever
been
recovered
from
paleoexplosion
craters
,
and

craters
containing

have
all
been
produced
by
metallic
meteorites

the
exception
of

This

inorganic

heretofore-accepted
assumption

Recent

of

crystallization
in
polymers

copolymers
--
The
crystallization
of
copolymers
comprising
Af
units
interspersed
with
a
minor
percentage
of
Af
is
limited
by
the
inability
of
the
crystal
lattice
characteristic
of
the
former
to
accommodate
the
bulky
side
group
of
the
latter
.
Only
uninterrupted
sequences
of
the
former
are
eligible
for
formation
of
crystallites
.
Limitations
on
the
lengths
of
these
sequences
diminish
the
stability
of
the
comparatively
short
crystallites
which
can
be
formed
,
and
this
is
reflected
in
a
broadening
of
the
melting
range
.

The

Contraction
of
muscle
--
Glycerinated

,
in
the
presence
of
the
physiological
agent
(
ATP
)
responsible
for
delivering
energy
to
the
mechanochemically
active
proteins
of
muscle
,
has
been
shown
to
undergo
a
contraction
which
is
highly
sensitive
both
to
temperature
and
to
solvent
composition
in
mixtures
of
alcohols
and
water
.
Experiments
carried
out
over
long
periods
of
time
in
order
to
allow
establishment
of
a
steady
state
have
shown
that
the
onset
of
contraction
and
its
completion
are
confined
to
an
interval
of
several
degrees
Centigrade
and
to
a
concentration
range
of
only
several
per
cent
.
The
contraction
therefore
partakes
of
the
character
of
a
phase
transition
.
While
ATP
appears
to
be
necessary
for
the
occurrence
of
contraction
,
its
presence
and
enzymatic
hydrolysis
of
it
by
the
muscle
protein
myosin
are
not
the
only

Polymerization
--
One
of
the
principal
aims
of
anionic
polymerization
techniques
is
the
synthesis
of
polymers
of
extremely
narrow
molecular
weight
distribution
.
A
simple
process
for
the
preparation
of
nearly
monodisperse
polystyrene
of
predictable
molecular
weight
has
been
developed
.
The
preparation
of
such
products
is
not
new
,
but
the
systems
heretofore
employed
in
polymerizations
have
commanded
considerable
experimental
skill
and
starting
materials
of
a
high
purity
.
In
the
new
process
impurities
present
in
the
solvent
(
benzene
)
,
the
monomer
,
and
in
the
reaction
system
which
would
cause
deactivation
of
propagation
centers
,
are
rendered
inactive
prior
to
polymerization
by
gradual
addition
of
initiator
,
a
mixture
of
butyl-lithium
and
telomeric
styryl-lithium
,
at
a
temperature
low
enough
to
suppress
chain
growth
.
Upon
completion
of
the
purging
step
,
additional
initiator
appropriate
for
the
molecular
weight
of
the
sample
desired
is
added
,
and
the
system
is
then
warmed
to
the
polymerization
temperature
,
at
which
the
reaction
is
allowed
to
go
to
completion
.
The
predictability
of
the
molecular
weights
was
found
to
be
within
10%
for
the
polymers
prepared
,
with
Af
ratios
less
than
1.1
.
Contrary
to
observations
with
ethers
,
no
apparent
change
of
the
reactivity
of
the
chain
ends
takes
place
over
considerable
periods
of
time
in
benzene
as
solvent

Properties
:
The
Barker
system
is
based
on
the
use
of
the
smallest
number
of
interfacial
angles
necessary
for
indexing
purposes
.
Other
morphological
,
physical
,
and
optical
property
values
are
also
given
.
Sources
of
data
:
The
index
is
essentially
a
new
treatment
of
previously
compiled
morphological
data
.
Most
of
the
data
used
are
from
Groth's
Chemische
Krystallographie
.
Criticality
:
Every
calculation
has
been
made
independently
by
two
workers
and
checked
by
one
of
the
editors
.
Use
of
nomenclature
,
symbols
,
units
,
physical
constants
:
Accepted
crystallographic
symbolism
has
been
used
;
;
other
symbols
related
to
the
index
necessarily
have
been
introduced
.
Currency
:
This

;
;
there
is
no
mechanism
for
keeping
the

Crystal
data
organization
:
The
present
edition
of
crystal
data
was
written
by
J.D.H.
Donnay
,
the
Johns
Hopkins
University
,
Baltimore
,
Md.
(
Part
2
)
)
and
Werner
Nowacki
,
University
of
Berne
,
Switzerland
(
Part
1
)
)
with
the
collaboration
of
Gabrielle
Donnay
,
U.
S.
Geological
Survey
,
Washington
,
D.
C.
.
Many
collaborators
in
the
United
States
and
Switzerland
helped
in
collecting
and
assembling
data
,
in
making
calculations
,
and
in
editing
.
Support
came
from
academic
and
industrial
groups
in
these
two
countries
.
The
Geological
Society
of
America
gave
a
grant-in-aid
to
complete
the
work
and
bore
the
expenses
of
publication
.
Preparation
of
a
second
edition
is
in
progress
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
Crystal
Data
Committee
of
the
American
Crystallographic
Association
.
Coeditors
are
J.D.H.
Donnay
,
G.
E.
Cox
of
Leeds
University
,
and
Olga
Kennard
of
the
National
Council
for
Medical
Research
,
London
.
Financial
grants
have
been
received
from
the
National
Science
Foundation
and
the
(
British
)
Institute
of
Physics
for
the
compilation
work
and
the
publication
costs
.
The
continuity
of
the
project
is
suggested
by
plans
for
an
eventual
third
edition
.
Substances
:
Elements
,
alloys
,
inorganic
and
organic
compounds
.
(
Metal
data
will
not
be
included
in
the
second
edition
,
since
these
have
been
collected
independently
by
W.
B.
Pearson
,
National
Research
Council
,
Ottawa
,
and
published
as
A
handbook
of
lattice
spacings
and
structures
of
metals
and
alloys
by
Pergamon
Press
.
)
properties
:
Crystallographic
data
resulting
mainly
from
X-ray
and
electron
diffraction
measurements
are
presented
.
Cell
dimensions
,
number
of
formula
units
per
cell
,
space
group
,
and
specific
gravity
are
given
for
all
substances
.
For
some
substances
,
auxiliary
properties
such
as
the
melting
point
are
given
.
Sources
of
data
:
Part
1
,
of
the
present
edition
covers
the
literature
to
mid-1948
;
;
Part
2
,
,
up
to
the
end
of
1951
.
Much
of
the
material
comes
directly
from
secondary
sources
such
as
Strukturbericht
.
Criticality
:
The
vast
number
of
compounds
to
be
covered
,
the
limited
resources
to
do
the
job
,
and
the
immediate
need
for
this
type
of
compilation
precluded
a
thorough
evaluation
of
all
available
data
in
the
present
edition
.
Future
editions
may
be
more
critical
.
Use
of
nomenclature
,
symbols
,
units
,
physical
constants
:
Since
Parts
1
,
and
2
,
were
prepared
independently
,
the
abbreviation
schemes
and
the
chemical
symbols
used
differ
in
the
two
parts
.
The
second
edition
should
have
greater
uniformity
.
Currency
:
A
second
edition
is
in
preparation
,
and
there
are
long
range
plans
for
a
third
.
Format
:
Data
in
the
present
edition
are
presented
in
tables
and
lists
.
Part
1
,
deals
with
the
classification
of
crystalline
substances
by
space
groups
and
is
not
a
numerical
data
compilation
.
The
compounds
are
divided
according
to
composition
into
seven
categories
.
Part
2
,
contains
determinative
tables
for
the
identification
of
crystalline
substances
.
These
are
arranged
according
to
crystal
system
.
There
are
formula
and
name
indexes
covering
both
parts
.
References
for
Part
1
,
are
given
at
the
end
and
for
Part
2
,
in
the
tables
.
Publication
and
distribution
:
The
present
edition
of
crystal
data
(

appeared
in
1948
and
the
last
supplement
in
1960
.
Though
now
complete
,
the
publication
is
included
in
this
directory
because
of
its
importance
and
because
of
the
long-term
nature
of
its
preparation
.
Substances
:
Elements
,
inorganic
and
organic
compounds
(
no
alloys
)
.
Properties
:
The
data
presented
are
derived
almost
entirely
from
X-ray
diffraction
measurements
and
include
atomic
coordinates
,
cell
dimensions
,
and
atomic
and
ionic
radii
.
Sources
of
data
:

literature
.
Criticality
:
The
aim
was
to
state
the
results
of
all
available
determinations
of
atomic
positions
in
crystals
.
Presumably
the
tabulated
data
are
best
available
values
.
The
critical
comments
in
the
textual
sections
of
this
publication
are
invaluable
.

Dana's
System
Of
Mineralogy
organization
:
Six
editions
of
James
Dwight
Dana's
System
appeared
between
1837
and
1892
.
In
1915
Edward
S.
Dana
,
editor
of
the
sixth
edition
,
asked
W.
E.
Ford
of
Yale
University
to
prepare
a
seventh
edition
of
his
father's
work
.
A
number
of
people
became
involved
in
the
preparation
but
work
was
slow
until
1937
.
In
that
year
a
grant
was
obtained
from
the
Penrose
Fund
of
the
Geological
Society
of
America
to
finance
additional
full-time
workers
.
Money
was
also
advanced
by
the
publishers
,
John
Wiley
&
Sons
,
Inc.
.
Volume
1
,
was
completed
in
1941
and
published
in
1944
.
The
editors
of
this
volume
and
Volume
2
,
were
the
late
Charles
Palache
,
Clifford
Frondel
,
and
the
late
Harry
Berman
,
all
of
Harvard
University
.
Work
on
Volume
2
,
was
begun
in
1941
,
interrupted
by
the
war
in
1942
,
and
resumed
in
1945
.
The
volume
was
completed
in
1950
and
published
in
1951
.
A
supplementary
grant
from
the
Geological
Society
of
America
helped
finance
its
publication
.
Besides
the
editors
there
were
many
contributors
in
the
United
States
and
Great
Britain
to
Volumes
1
,
and
2
.
W.
E.
Ford
,
for
example
,
continued
to
supply
data
on
the
occurrence
of
minerals
until
his
death
in
1939
.
Volume
3
,
is
nearing
completion
and
there
are
plans
to
revise
Volume
1
.

The
Groth
Institute
organization
:
``
The
Groth
Institute
''
,
which
was
established
in
1958
,
is
a
group
activity
affiliated
with
the
Physics
Department
of
The
Pennsylvania
State
University
,
University
Park
,
Pa.
.
Ray
Pepinsky
is
the
Director
.
The
Institute
derives
its
name
from
Paul
Von
Groth's
Chemische
Krystallographie
,
a
five-volume
work
which
appeared
between
1906
and
1919
.
The
resident
staff
is
large
and
consists
of
professional
assistants
,
graduate
students
,
abstractors
,
librarian
,
technical
editor
,
machine

,
secretarial

,
and
others
.
There
are
also
corresponding
members
and
outside
advisory
groups
.
The
Air
Force
Office
of
Scientific
Research
has
provided
financial
assistance
in
the
early
stages
of
the
Institute's
program
.
Substances
:
All
crystalline
substances
and
other
solid-state
materials
.
Properties
:
The
aim
is
to
collect
a
very
broad
range
of
physical
,
chemical
,
morphological
,
and
structural
data
for
crystals
on
an
encyclopedic
scale
and
to
seek
all
possible
useful
and
revealing
correlations
of
properties
with
internal
structure
.
Sources
of
data
:
The
first
stage
of
operation
has
centered
on
the
literature
imaging
of
critical
or
summarizing
tabulations
such
as
the
Barker
Index
.
Coverage
of
primary
literature
will
follow
.
Unpublished
data
will
be
available
to
the
Groth
institute
from
cooperating
groups
and
individuals
.
Criticality
:
Critical
evaluation
of
all
data
compiled
is
not
a
primary
aim
of
this
project
.
However
,
the
proposed
correlation
of
the
many
interrelated
properties
of
crystals
will
reveal
discrepancies
in
the
recorded
data
and
suggest
areas
for
reinvestigation
.
In
addition
,
the
availability
of
computers
will
permit
recalculation
and
refinement
of
much
structural
information
.
Use
of
nomenclature
,
symbols
,
units
,
physical
constants
:
For
punched-card
or
tape
storage
of
information
all
literature
values
must
be
conformed
to
a
common
language
.
In
this
way
a
degree
of
unification
of
nomenclature
,
symbols
,
and
units
will
be
realized
.
Because
individual
classes
of
foods
differ
in
their
requirements
for
preservation
,
a
number
of
methods
have
been
developed
over
the
years
involving
one
or
a
combination
of
procedures
such
as
dehydration
,
fermentation
,
salting
,
chemical
treatment
,
canning
,
refrigeration
,
and
freezing
.
The
basic
objectives
in
each
instance
are
to
make
available
supplies
of
food
during
the
intervals
between
harvesting
or
slaughter
,
to
minimize
losses
resulting
from
the
action
of
microorganisms
and
insects
,
and
to
make
it
possible
to
transport
foods
from
the
area
of
harvest
or
production
to
areas
of
consumption
.
In
earlier
years
,
the
preservation
of
food
was
essentially
related
to
survival
.
In
the
more
sophisticated
atmosphere
of
today's
developed
nations
,
food-preservation
techniques
have
sought
also
to
bring
variety
,
peak
freshness
,
and
optimum
taste
and
flavor
in
foods
at
reasonable
cost
to
the
consumer
.
With
the
development
of
nuclear
technology
,
isotopic
materials
,
and
machine
radiation
sources
in
recent
years
,
the
possibilities
of
applying
ionizing
radiation
to
the
preservation
of
foods
attracted
the
attention
of
investigators
in
the
United
States
and
throughout
the
world
.
An
early
hope
that
irradiation
might
be
the
ultimate
answer
to
practically
all
food
preservation
problems
was
soon
dispelled
.
Interest
remained
,
however
,
in
the
possibility
that
it
would
serve
as
a
useful
supplementary
method
for
counteracting
spoilage
losses
and
for
preserving
some
foods
at
lower
over-all
costs
than
freezing
,
or
without
employing
heat
or
chemicals
with
their
attendant
taste
alterations
.
Factors
responsible
for
the
spoilage
of
foods
The
chief
factors
responsible
for
the
spoilage
of
fresh
foodstuffs
are
(
1
)
microorganisms
such
as
bacteria
,
molds
,
and
yeasts
,
(
2
)
enzymes
,
(
3
)
insects
,
(
4
)
sprouting
,
and
(
5
)
chemical
reactions
.
Microorganisms
are
often
responsible
for
the
rapid
spoilage
of
foods
.
Of
special
concern
is
the
growth
of
bacteria
such
as
Clostridium
botulinum
which
generate
poisonous
products
.
Enzymatic
action
in
stored
food
produces
changes
which
can
adversely
affect
the
appearance
of
food
or
its
palatability
.
Spoilage
by
chemical
action
results
from
the
reaction
of
one
group
of
components
in
the
food
with
others
or
with
its
environment
,
as
in
corrosion
of
the
walls
of
metal
containers
or
the
reaction
of
fats
with
oxygen
in
the
air
to
produce
rancidity
.
Sprouting
is
a
naturally
occurring
phenomenon
in
stored
potatoes
,
onions
,
carrots
,
beets
,
and
similar
root
vegetables
.
Insect
infestation
is
a
problem
of
importance
chiefly
in
stored
grain
.
The
presence
of
parasitic
organisms
such
as
Trichinella
spiralis
in
pork
introduces
another
factor
which
must
be
dealt
with
in
food
processing
.
To
permit
the
storage
of
food
for
long
periods
of
time
,
a
method
of
preservation
must
accomplish
the
destruction
of
microorganisms
and
inhibition
of
enzymatic
action
.
The
term
``
sterilization
''
applies
to
methods
involving
essentially
complete
destruction
of
all
microorganisms
.
Food
treated
in
this
manner
and
protected
from
recontamination
by
aseptic
methods
of
packaging
and
containment
presumably
could
be
stored
for
long
periods
without
refrigeration
.
The
process
of
``
pasteurization
''
involves
milder
and
less
prolonged
heat
treatment
which
accomplishes
the
destruction
of
most
,
but
not
all
,
of
the
microorganisms
.
Less
severe
thermal
treatment
as
by
blanching
or
scalding
serves
to
inactivate
enzymes
.
General
effects
of
ionizing
radiation
Ionizing
radiation
can
cause
the
destruction
of
microorganisms
and
insects
involved
in
food
spoilage
or
,
at
lower
doses
,
can
inhibit
their
action
.
It
furnishes
a
means
of
destroying
insects
in
stored
grain
products
as
well
as
certain
parasitic
organisms
present
in
meats
.
Deactivation
of
enzymes
is
also
possible
,
although
some
types
require
extremely
heavy
doses
of
10
Mrad
or
more
.
Because
of
undesirable
flavors
,
odors
,
colors
,
and
generally
low
palatability
associated
with
radiation
treatment
of
this
magnitude
,
the
inactivation
of
enzymes
is
best
accomplished
prior
to
irradiation
by
the
conventional
heat-processing
methods
of
blanching
.
Radiation
does
not
retard
the
chemical
spoilage
of
food
.
It
will
,
however
,
inhibit
the
sprouting
of
potatoes
and
other
root
vegetables
.
The
radiation
doses
required
for
the
preservation
of
foods
are
in
the
following
ranges
:
1
.
For
radiosterilization
,
to
destroy
all
organisms
for
long-term
preservation
--
about
4.5
Mrad
for
nonacid
foods
of
low
salt
content
.
2
.
For
radiopasteurization
,
to
partially
destroy
microorganisms
;
;
results
vary
with
types
of
food
,
storage
conditions
,
and
objectives
of
treatment
--
commonly
of
the
order
of
0.2
Mrads
but
up
to
about
0.8
Aj
.
3
.
For
destruction
of
insects
--
about
25,000
Aj
.
4
.
For
inhibiting
the
sprouting
of
root
vegetables
--
4,000
to
10,000
Aj
.
Preserving
foods
with
ionizing
radiation
leads
to
some
undesirable
side
effects
,
particularly
at
the
higher
radiation
dosages
.
In
this
respect
,
the
general
palatability
and
individual
acceptance
of
most
radiosterilized
foods
has
,
to
date
,
been
found
to
be
low
in
comparison
with
fresh
and
commercially
processed
foods
.
A
number
of
foods
are
quite
acceptable
as
regards
taste
and
palatability
,
however
,
at
dosages
substantially
less
than
sterilization
levels
.
Moreover
,
the
nutritive
value
of
irradiated
foods
apparently
undergoes
little
,
if
any
,
change
,
although
some
of
the
fat-soluble
vitamins
are
affected
by
sterilization
doses
.
Radiation
sources
For
irradiation
of
food
,
the
results
obtained
depend
upon
the
dose
rather
than
the
specific
type
of
radiation
,
and
X-ray
,
gamma
,
and
high-energy
electron
radiation
are
suitable
.
Aside
from
availability
and
economic
considerations
,
each
has
certain
practical
advantages
;
;
for
example
,
gamma
rays
give
deeper
penetration
but
cannot
be
focused
or
collimated
,
whereas
unidirectional
electron
beams
may
be
split
and
directed
to
both
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
food
package
to
be
irradiated
.
Selection
of
a
source
for
commercial
irradiation
would
involve
consideration
of
numerous
factors
including
required
dose
rate
,
load
factor
,
throughput
,
convenience
,
safety
,
and
most
important
,
costs
.
Of
the
potentially
useful
sources
of
ionizing
radiations
,
gamma
sources
,
cobalt-60
,
cesium-137
,
fission
products
,
or
a
reactor
irradiation
loop
system
using
a
material
such
as
an
indium
salt
have
received
most
attention
for
food-preservation
systems
.
Of
the
various
particle
accelerators
,
the
Van
De
Graff
machines
,
resonant
transformers
,
and
linear
accelerators
are
the
principal
ones
available
for
commercial
use
.
Costs
of
the
effective
energy
produced
by
these
sources
is
a
major
obstacle
in
the
development
of
food-preservation
processes
.
Estimated
production
costs
of
radiation
energy
from
machine
and
nuclide
sources
range
from
$1
to
$10
per
Aj
.
Conventional
energy
for
processing
foods
is
available
in
the
range
of
at
most
a
few
cents
per
kwhr
for
electric
power
and
the
equivalent
of
a
few
mills
per
kwhr
for
process
steam
.
Radiation
,
therefore
,
is
at
an
initial
cost
disadvantage
even
though
only
1
to
10
per
cent
as
much
radiation
energy
as
heat
energy
is
required
for
radiopasteurization
or
radiosterilization
.
What
are
the
possibilities
of
lowered
radiation
production
costs
for
the
future
?
?
It
has
been
estimated
that
for
applications
on
a
megawatt
scale
costs
might
reach
values
in
the
neighborhood
of
10
cents
per
kwhr
for
large-scale
accelerators
or
for
gamma
radiation
generated
in
a
reactor
core
.
No
comparable
reductions
in
the
cost
of
nuclide
radiation
are
foreseen
.
Such
projections
,
however
,
appear
highly
speculative
and
the
capacities
involved
are
far
beyond
those
foreseen
for
food-preservation
facilities
.
Because
agricultural
activities
are
seasonal
and
the
areas
of
production
and
harvest
of
many
foods
are
widely
scattered
geographically
,
and
because
of
the
high
cost
of
transporting
bulk
food
items
any
substantial
distance
to
a
central
processing
location
,
the
use
of
large
central
processing
stations
,
where
low-cost
radiation
facilities
approaching
the
megawatt
range
might
be
utilized
,
is
inherently
impracticable
.
Present
status
of
irradiation
preservation
of
foods
The
objective
of
complete
sterilization
of
foods
is
to
produce
a
wholesome
and
palatable
product
capable
of
being
stored
without
refrigeration
for
extended
periods
of
time
.
Chief
interest
in
radiosterilization
resides
in
the
military
services
.
For
them
,
providing
appetizing
food
under
battle
or
emergency
conditions
is
a
paramount
consideration
.
They
require
completely
sterile
foods
capable
of
being
stored
without
refrigeration
,
preferably
items
already
cooked
and
ready
to
eat
.
High
nutritional
value
,
variety
,
palatability
,
and
appetizing
appearance
are
important
for
reasons
of
morale
.
Foods
for
rear
stations
,
which
require
cooking
,
but
no
refrigeration
,
are
also
of
interest
.
Of
primary
interest
are
meats
.
Radiopasteurization
,
which
produces
fewer
adverse
sensory
changes
in
food
products
,
has
potential
usefulness
in
prolonging
the
keeping
qualities
of
fresh
and
refrigerated
food
items
.
Thus
,
food
so
processed
might
reach
more
remote
markets
and
permit
the
consumer
to
enjoy
more
produce
at
peak
freshness
and
palatability
.
Commercial
interest
is
chiefly
in
this
type
of
treatment
,
as
is
military
interest
under
peacetime
conditions
.
The
present
status
of
food
preservation
by
ionizing
radiation
is
discussed
by
food
classes
in
the
following
paragraphs
.
Meats
The
radiation
processing
of
meat
has
received
extensive
investigation
.
To
date
,
the
one
meat
showing
favorable
results
at
sterilization
doses
is
pork
.
Of
particular
interest
to
the
military
services
is
the
demonstration
that
roast
pork
,
after
radiosterilization
,
is
superior
in
palatability
to
available
canned
pork
products
.
Tests
with
beef
have
been
largely
unsuccessful
because
of
the
development
of
off-flavors
.
A
prime
objective
of
the
Army
Quartermaster
Corps
program
is
to
find
the
reasons
for
beef's
low
palatability
and
means
of
overcoming
it
,
since
it
is
a
major
and
desirable
dietary
item
.
Partly
because
low-level
heat
treatment
is
needed
to
inactivate
enzymes
before
radiosterilization
,
treated
fresh
meats
have
the
appearance
of
boiled
or
canned
meat
.
Off-flavor
is
a
less
severe
problem
with
the
radiopasteurization
of
meats
,
but
problems
of
commercial
acceptability
remain
.
Moderate
radiation
doses
of
from
100,000
to
200,000
rads
can
extend
the
shelf
life
(
at
35
F
)
of
fresh
beef
from
5
days
to
5
or
6
weeks
.
However
,
the
problem
of
consumer
acceptability
remains
.
The
preradiation
blanching
process
discolors
the
treated
beef
and
liquid
accumulates
in
prepackaged
cuts
.
Cooked
beef
irradiated
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
assumes
an
unnatural
pink
color
.
When
lamb
and
mutton
are
irradiated
at
substerilization
doses
,
the
meat
becomes
dehydrated
,
the
fat
becomes
chalky
,
and
,
again
,
unnatural
changes
in
color
occur
.
Ground
meats
such
as
fresh
pork
sausage
and
hamburger
have
a
relatively
short
shelf
life
under
refrigeration
,
and
radiopasteurization
might
be
thought
to
offer
distinctly
improved
keeping
qualities
.
However
,
a
major
problem
here
is
one
of
scale
of
processing
;
;
ground
meats
are
usually
prepared
from
scrap
meats
at
the
local
level
,
whereas
irradiation
at
economic
volumes
of
production
would
require
central
processing
and
distribution
facilities
.
The
problems
of
color
change
by
blanching
and
liquid
accumulation
within
the
package
are
the
same
as
for
solid
cuts
.
Specialty
cooked
items
containing
meat
portions
,
as
in
``
frozen
dinners
''
might
offer
a
potential
use
for
radiopasteurization
.
The
principal
potential
advantage
would
be
that
the
finished
product
could
be
transported
and
stored
at
lower
cost
under
refrigeration
instead
of
being
frozen
.
A
refrigerated
item
could
also
be
heated
and
served
in
less
time
than
is
required
for
frozen
foods
of
the
same
type
.
Competitive
processes
for
preserving
meats
are
by
canning
and
freezing
.
Costs
of
canning
meat
are
in
the
range
of
0.8
to
5
cents
per
pound
;
;
costs
of
freezing
are
in
the
area
of
2
to
3.5
cents
per
pound
.
The
table
on
page
10
shows
costs
of
canning
and
freezing
meat
,
and
estimated
costs
for
irradiation
under
certain
assumed
conditions
.
Under
the
conditions
of
comparison
,
it
will
be
noted
that
:
(
1
)
Radiosterilization
(
at
3
Mrad
)
is
more
expensive
than
canning
,
particularly
for
the
cesium-137
source
.
(
2
)
Radiopasteurization
by
either
the
electron
accelerator
or
cesium-137
source
is
in
the
range
of
freezing
costs
.
(
3
)
Irradiation
using
the
nuclide
source
is
more
expensive
than
use
of
an
electron
accelerator
.
Poultry
Results
of
irradiation
tests
with
poultry
have
been
quite
successful
.
At
sterilizing
doses
,
good
palatability
results
,
with
a
minimum
of
changes
in
appearance
,
taste
,
and
odor
.
Radiopasteurization
has
also
been
successful
,
and
the
shelf
life
of
chicken
can
be
extended
to
a
month
or
more
under
refrigerated
storage
as
compared
with
about
10
days
for
the
untreated
product
.
Acceptable
taste
and
odor
are
retained
by
the
irradiated
and
refrigerated
chicken
.
Acceptance
of
radiopasteurization
is
likely
to
be
delayed
,
however
,
for
two
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
storage
life
of
fresh
chicken
under
refrigeration
is
becoming
a
minimal
problem
because
of
constantly
improved
sanitation
and
distributing
practices
,
and
(
2
)
treatment
by
antibiotics
,
a
measure
already
approved
by
the
Federal
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
serves
to
extend
the
storage
life
of
chicken
at
a
low
cost
of
about
0.5
cents
per
pound
.
Seafood
Fresh
seafood
products
are
extremely
perishable
.
Although
refrigeration
has
served
to
extend
the
storage
life
of
these
products
,
substantially
increased
consumption
might
be
possible
if
areas
remote
from
the
seacoast
could
be
served
adequately
.
Furthermore
,
it
has
made
an
exact
assessment
of
the
removal
mechanisms
possible
.
The
instrument
is
shown
in
Fig.
1
and
consists
essentially
of
a
hard
,
sharp
,
tungsten
carbide
knife
which
is
pushed
along
the
substrate
to
remove
the
coating
.
The
force
required
to
accomplish
removal
is
plotted
,
by
means
of
an
electronic
recorder
,
against
distance
of
removal
.
Since
the
removal
force
is
a
function
of
coating
thickness
,
a
differential
transformer
pickup
has
been
incorporated
into
the
instrument
to
accurately
measure
film
thickness
.
This
,
too
,
is
recorded
against
distance
by
a
repeat
run
over
the
same
track
previously
cut
.
A
number
of
adjustment
features
are
included
in
the
Hesiometer
to
facilitate
measurement
and
permit
ready
removal
of
coatings
deposited
on
such
substrates
as
iron
and
other
metals
,
glass
,
wood
,
and
plastic
surfaces
.
The
measurement
of
topcoats
on
primers
can
also
readily
be
carried
out
.
Hesiometer
results
have
been
found
to
compare
excellently
with
manual
knife
scratching
tests
.
The
instrumental
method
,
however
,
is
about
100
times
more
sensitive
and
yields
numerical
results
which
can
be
accurately
repeated
at
will
over
a
period
of
time
.
If
a
wedge-shaped
coating
of
increasing
thickness
is
removed
from
a
substrate
by
an
instrument
like
the
Hesiometer
with
a
knife
of
constant
rake
angle
,
a
number
of
removal
mechanisms
are
often
observed
which
depend
upon
the
thickness
of
the
coating
.
At
low
thicknesses
a
cutting
(
or
shearing
)
phenomenon
is
often
encountered
.
As
the
coating
becomes
thicker
,
the
cutting
may
abruptly
change
to
a
cracking
type
of
failure
.
If
the
coating
becomes
still
thicker
,
a
peeling
type
failure
finally
can
occur
.
The
typical
appearance
of
these
various
mechanisms
is
illustrated
in
Figs.
2
,
3
,
and
4
,
which
are
single
frame
enlargements
of
high
speed
movies
taken
during
the
course
of
the
knife
removal
process
.
It
can
be
seen
from
Fig.
2
that
the
cutting
removal
of
a
coating
from
its
substrate
involves
pure
cohesive
failure
of
the
coating
.
The
molecular
forces
holding
the
coating
to
the
substrate
are
obviously
greater
than
the
cohesive
strength
of
the
coating
and
failure
occurs
by
shear
along
a
plane
starting
at
the
tip
of
the
knife
and
extending
to
the
coating
surface
.
The
pictures
of
Figs.
3
and
4
show
the
cracking
and
peeling
types
of
removal
where
the
coating
is
detached
by
failure
in
a
region
at
,
or
close
to
,
the
interface
between
coating
and
substrate
.
If
the
force
required
to
remove
the
coatings
is
plotted
against
film
thickness
,
a
graph
as
illustrated
schematically
in
Fig.
5
may
characteristically
result
.
Here
,
H
is
the
coatings
removal
force
measured
parallel
to
the
surface
of
the
substrate
and
T
is
the
film
thickness
.
It
can
be
seen
that
the
force
is
characteristic
of
the
removal
process
and
changes
abruptly
from
cutting
to
cracking
to
peeling
removal
.
Also
,
it
can
be
readily
seen
that
the
cutting
and
peeling
types
of
failure
show
a
steady
state
response
,
while
the
cracking
mechanism
is
of
a
dynamic
nature
.
It
should
be
recalled
that
these
three
mechanisms
can
occur
on
the
same
coating
deposited
upon
the
same
substrate
merely
as
a
function
of
changes
in
coatings
thickness
.
Presumably
the
interfacial
bond
strength
and
gross
cohesive
properties
are
identical
in
each
case
.
What
then
,
are
the
factors
that
contribute
to
these
phenomena
?
?
Why
should
the
``
practical
adhesion
''
of
a
coating
as
assessed
by
a
knife
method
change
,
initially
increasing
rather
rapidly
and
then
decreasing
stepwise
to
very
low
values
as
the
knife
is
forced
through
a
coating
of
increasing
thickness
?
?
Cutting
mechanism
of
cohesive
failure
The
cutting
(
or
shearing
)
removal
process
has
been
previously
described
.
It
was
found
that
the
coating
is
separated
from
its
substrate
entirely
by
cohesive
failure
.
The
details
of
the
removal
process
are
shown
schematically
in
Fig.
6
.
The
various
forces
result
from
the
reaction
of
the
removed
paint
chip
against
the
face
of
the
knife
and
along
the
shear
plane
,
which
makes
an
angle
**yf
with
the
substrate
.
The
action
and
reaction
forces
are
R
and
Af
,
respectively
,
and
are
equal
and
opposite
in
direction
.
All
the
other
force
vectors
are
derived
from
these
.
Af
is
the
force
required
to
cut
a
coating
of
thickness
T
from
the
substrate
.
Af
is
the
shear
force
along
the
shear
plane
;
;
Af
and
Af
are
the
thrust
forces
acting
against
coating
and
knife
,
respectively
;
;
Af
is
the
normal
compressive
force
acting
on
the
shear
plane
;
;
Af
is
the
friction
force
between
chip
and
knife
surfaces
,
and
P
is
the
normal
force
acting
on
the
face
of
the
knife
.
**yc
is
the
rake
angle
of
the
knife
;
;
**yf
is
the
angle
the
shear
plane
makes
with
the
substrate
;
;
**yt
is
the
friction
angle
;
;
and
**yb
is
the
angle
the
resultants
make
with
the
plane
of
the
substrate
.
An
analysis
of
the
vector
relationships
shows
that
the
rake
angle
**yc
and
the
friction
angle
**yt
determine
the
vector
direction
Af
of
the
force
resultants
R
and
Af
.
Consequently
,
both
the
rake
angle
of
the
knife
as
well
as
the
friction
occurring
between
the
back
of
the
removed
coating
and
the
front
of
the
knife
will
determine
in
large
part
the
detailed
mechanism
of
the
cutting
removal
process
.
It
is
difficult
to
measure
the
direction
and
magnitude
of
R
directly
.
In
actual
practice
,
the
values
most
readily
amenable
to
measurement
are
the
cutting
force
Af
and
the
shear
angle
Aj
.
These
two
values
and
the
rake
angle
**yc
are
sufficient
to
determine
the
other
parameters
of
these
relationships
.
**yc
is
defined
by
the
geometry
of
the
knife
;
;
**yf
can
readily
be
determined
by
measuring
the
thickness
of
the
coating
before
and
after
cutting
from
the
substrate
;
;
Af
is
instrumentally
determined
.
From
Fig.
6
the
relationship
between
these
parameters
can
readily
be
derived
and
the
cutting
force
is
Af
where
**yl
is
the
shear
strength
of
the
coating
and
is
a
parameter
of
the
coatings
material
,
W
is
the
width
of
the
removed
coating
and
T
is
its
thickness
.
If
the
cutting
force
,
Af
,
is
plotted
against
film
thickness
,
a
straight
line
should
result
passing
through
the
origin
and
having
slope
Af
.
However
,
in
the
actual
assessment
of
the
cutting
force
by
instrumental
methods
for
any
thickness
of
coating
a
number
of
spurious
effects
occur
which
must
be
taken
into
account
and
which
make
the
measured
value
larger
than
the
true
cutting
force
indicated
by
eqn.
(
1
)
.
Blunt
knife
One
of
these
is
the
fact
that
the
knife
employed
,
no
matter
how
well
sharpened
,
will
have
a
slightly
rounded
cutting
edge
.
This
signifies
that
**yc
,
the
rake
angle
,
is
no
longer
a
constant
to
zero
film
thickness
.
The
curvature
of
this
bluntness
is
,
in
the
case
of
the
Carboloy
knife
employed
in
the
Hesiometer
,
determined
by
the
grain
sizes
of
the
polished
grit
and
the
tungsten
carbide
crystals
cemented
together
in
the
knife
body
and
is
in
the
order
of
0.1
to
0.2
mil.
.
The
force
vector
concept
of
Fig.
6
can
readily
be
applied
to
this
condition
also
.
Because
the
rake
angle
Af
at
the
tip
of
the
knife
is
very
much
smaller
(
or
even
negative
)
when
compared
to
the
value
of
**yc
for
the
major
portion
of
the
knife
,
a
very
rapid
increase
in
cutting
force
with
thickness
will
result
.
This
reduces
to
the
relationship
:
Af
,
where
Af
is
the
intercept
at
zero
thickness
of
the
extrapolation
of
the
slope
indicated
in
eqn.
(
1
)
,
Af
is
the
thickness
of
the
coating
equivalent
to
the
rounding
off
of
the
knife
tip
,
Af
is
a
straight
line
first
approximation
of
this
roundness
,
and
the
other
symbols
are
equivalent
to
those
of
eqn.
(
1
)
.
It
can
be
seen
that
Af
is
a
constant
,
and
is
determined
for
the
most
part
by
the
geometry
of
the
knife
.
The
blunter
the
knife
,
the
higher
is
the
value
of
Af
.
The
importance
of
a
hard
,
abrasion-resistant
knife
material
like
the
Carboloy
employed
in
the
Hesiometer
immediately
becomes
apparent
.
Softer
knives
would
blunt
very
rapidly
,
making
the
value
of
Af
inexact
.
In
extreme
cases
of
very
soft
knives
this
value
may
even
change
during
the
course
of
a
measurement
.
Knife
friction
A
second
factor
which
enters
into
the
practical
measurement
of
the
instrumentally
determined
cutting
force
is
the
frictional
resistance
caused
by
the
bottom
of
the
knife
against
the
substrate
.
This
is
not
a
constant
value
like
Af
,
but
varies
with
the
thickness
of
the
coating
and
the
direction
and
magnitude
of
the
resultants
R
and
Af
of
Fig.
6
.
Under
equilibrium
conditions
of
cutting
the
chip
exerts
a
thrust
Af
against
the
knife
which
tends
to
push
it
into
the
substrate
or
lift
it
away
from
the
substrate
depending
on
the
vector
direction
of
Af
.
The
resultant
friction
force
,
Af
is
thus
directly
proportional
to
Af
and
consequently
also
to
film
thickness
.
The
value
of
Af
can
readily
be
assessed
by
determining
the
frictional
force
exerted
on
the
knife
while
running
over
the
previously
stripped
coating
track
under
various
external
loadings
.
A
straight
line
relationship
is
usually
observed
in
a
plot
of
Af
against
load
L
,
having
slope
k
,
and
Af
.
Since
the
load
L
,
under
actual
cutting
conditions
is
caused
by
Af
,
it
can
be
seen
that
Af
.
The
measured
force
,
H
,
in
cutting
removal
of
coatings
from
their
substrates
consequently
can
be
seen
to
be
the
sum
of
that
force
required
to
cut
the
coating
,
Af
,
that
due
to
the
bluntness
of
the
knife
,
Af
,
and
that
due
to
the
friction
between
the
bottom
of
the
knife
and
the
substrate
,
Af
,
or
Af
.
The
first
two
forces
are
directly
interrelated
and
depend
upon
film
thickness
,
whereas
Af
is
independent
of
these
two
and
is
a
constant
for
a
given
knife/coating
combination
.
These
theoretical
relationships
are
more
clearly
illustrated
in
Fig.
7
and
their
sum
can
be
seen
to
correlate
in
form
with
practical
measurements
made
with
the
Hesiometer
as
illustrated
in
the
first
portion
of
Fig.
5
for
the
cutting
mechanism
.
Chipping
mechanism
of
cohesive
failure
Although
a
large
number
of
coatings
systems
,
particularly
at
low
thicknesses
fail
cohesively
by
the
cutting
mechanism
,
frequently
a
second
type
of
cohesive
failure
may
also
take
place
.
This
is
a
chipping
,
dynamic
type
failure
encountered
with
very
brittle
coatings
resins
or
very
highly
pigmented
films
.
This
is
shown
in
the
photomicrograph
of
Fig.
8
.
The
basic
difference
between
the
continuous
cutting
mechanism
and
that
of
the
chipping
mechanism
is
that
instead
of
shear
occurring
in
the
coating
ahead
of
the
knife
continuously
without
fracture
,
rupture
intermittently
occurs
along
the
shear
plane
.
The
detailed
mechanisms
of
this
type
of
failure
have
been
studied
extensively
by
Merchant
for
metal
cutting
,
and
the
principles
found
can
be
directly
applied
to
coatings
.
By
studying
high
speed
movies
made
of
this
type
of
failure
,
the
sequence
of
relationships
as
schematically
illustrated
in
Fig.
9
could
be
observed
.
In
the
first
picture
(
9a
)
the
knife
is
just
beginning
to
advance
into
the
inclined
surface
which
was
left
from
the
previous
chip
formation
.
In
the
next
,
the
shear
plane
angle
is
high
,
and
extends
to
the
inclined
work
surface
.
With
increasing
advance
of
the
knife
into
the
coating
the
shear
plane
extends
to
the
coatings
surface
and
the
shear
angle
rapidly
decreases
.
Eventually
,
rupture
occurs
along
the
shear
plane
(
9e
)
,
and
the
cycle
repeats
itself
.
Merchant
has
found
that
the
same
basic
relationships
which
describe
the
geometry
and
force
systems
in
the
case
of
the
cutting
mechanism
can
also
be
applied
to
the
discontinuous
chip
formation
provided
the
proper
values
of
instantaneous
shear
angle
and
instantaneous
chip
thickness
or
cross-sectional
area
are
used
.
Consequently
,
if
the
shear
angle
**yf
is
replaced
by
the
rupture
angle
Af
,
the
relationships
as
described
in
eqns.
(
1
)
,
(
2
)
,
(
4
)
,
and
(
6
)
will
directly
apply
.
The
cracking
mechanism
Under
equilibrium
cutting
conditions
,
the
chip
exerts
a
force
Af
against
the
coating
and
an
equal
opposite
force
Af
against
the
knife
in
the
plane
of
the
substrate
as
shown
in
Fig.
6
.
If
the
rake
angle
**yc
of
the
knife
is
high
enough
and
the
friction
angle
**yt
between
the
front
of
the
knife
and
the
back
of
the
chip
is
low
enough
to
give
a
positive
value
for
Af
,
the
resultant
vector
R
will
lie
above
the
plane
of
the
substrate
.
Within
only
a
few
years
,
foamed
plastics
materials
have
managed
to
grow
into
an
integral
,
and
important
,
phase
of
the
plastics
industry
--
and
the
end
is
still
not
yet
in
sight
.
Urethane
foam
,
as
only
one
example
,
was
only
introduced
commercially
in
this
country
in
1955
.
Yet
last
year's
volume
probably
topped
100
million
lb.
and
expectations
are
for
a
market
of
275
million
lb.
by
1964
.
Many
of
the
other
foamed
plastics
,
particularly
the
styrenes
,
show
similar
growth
potential
.
And
there
are
even
newer
foamed
plastics
that
are
yet
to
be
evaluated
.
As
this
issue
goes
to
press
,
for
example
,
one
manufacturer
has
announced
an
epoxy
foam
with
outstanding
buoyancy
and
impact
strength
;
;
another
reports
that
a
cellular
polypropylene
,
primarily
for
use
in
wire
coating
applications
,
is
being
investigated
.
On
the
following
pages
,
each
of
the
major
commercial
foamed
plastics
is
described
in
detail
,
as
to
properties
,
applications
,
and
methods
of
processing
.
It
might
be
well
to
point
out
,
however
,
some
of
the
newer
developments
that
have
taken
place
within
the
past
few
months
which
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
future
of
the
various
foamed
plastics
involved
.
In
urethane
foams
,
for
example
,
there
has
been
a
definite
trend
toward
the
polyether-type
materials
(
which
are
now
available
in
two-component
rigid
foam
systems
)
and
the
emphasis
is
definitely
on
one-shot
molding
.
Most
manufacturers
also
seem
to
be
concentrating
on
formulating
fire-resistant
or
self-extinguishing
grades
of
urethane
foam
that
are
aimed
specifically
at
the
burgeoning
building
markets
.
Urethane
foam
as
an
insulator
is
also
coming
in
for
a
good
deal
of
attention
.
In
one
outstanding
example
,
Whirlpool
Corp.
found
that
by
switching
to
urethane
foam
insulation
,
they
could
increase
the
storage
capacity
of
gas
refrigerators
to
make
them
competitive
with
electric
models
.
Much
interest
has
also
been
expressed
in
new
techniques
for
processing
the
urethane
foams
,
including
spraying
,
frothing
,
and
molding
(
see
article
,
p.
391
for
details
)
.
And
in
meeting
the
demands
for
urethane
foam
as
a
garment
interlining
,
new
adhesives
and
new
methods
of
laminating
foam
to
a
substrate
have
been
developed
.
New
techniques
for
automatic
molding
of
expandable
styrene
beads
have
helped
boost
that
particular
material
into
a
number
of
new
consumer
applications
,
including
picnic
chests
,
beverage
coolers
,
flower
pots
,
and
flotation-type
swimming
toys
.
Two
other
end-use
areas
which
contributed
to
expandable
styrene's
growth
during
the
year
were
packaging
(
molded
inserts
replacing
complicated
cardboard
units
)
and
foamed-core
building
panels
.
Extruded
expandable
styrene
film
or
sheet
--
claimed
to
be
competitive
price-wise
with
paper
--
also
showed
much
potential
,
particularly
for
packaging
.
Sandwich
panels
for
building
utility
shelters
that
consist
of
kraft
paper
skins
and
rigid
styrene
foam
cores
also
aroused
interest
in
the
construction
field
.
In
vinyl
foam
,
the
big
news
was
the
development
of
techniques
for
coating
fabrics
with
the
material
(
for
details
,
see
P.
395
)
.
Better
``
hand
''
,
a
more
luxurious
feel
,
and
better
insulating
properties
were
claimed
to
be
the
result
.
Several
companies
also
saw
possibilities
in
using
the
technique
for
extruding
or
molding
vinyl
products
with
a
slight
cellular
core
that
would
reduce
costs
yet
would
not
affect
physical
properties
of
the
end
product
to
any
great
extent
.

additional
information
on
foams
are

Plastics
Chart

Data

Urethane
foams
Since
the
mid
1950s
,
when
urethane
foam
first
made
its
appearance
in
the
American
market
,
growth
has
been
little
short
of
fantastic
.
Present
estimates
are
that
production
topped
the
100-million-lb.
mark
in
1960
(
85
to
90
million
lb.
for
flexible
,
10
or
11
million
lb.
for
rigid
)
;
;
by
1965
,
production
may
range
from
200
to
350
million
lb.
for
flexible
and
from
115
to
150
million
lb.
for
rigid
.
The
markets
that
have
started
to
open
up
for
the
foam
in
the
past
year
or
so
seem
to
justify
the
expectations
.
Furniture
upholstery
,
as
just
one
example
,
can
easily
take
millions
of
pounds
;
;
foamed
refrigerator
insulation
is
under
intensive
evaluation
by
every
major
manufacturer
;
;
and
use
of
the
foam
for
garment
interlining
is
only
now
getting
off
the
ground
,
with
volume
potential
in
the
offing
.
Basic
chemistry
Urethane
foams
are
,
basically
,
reaction
products
of
hydroxyl-rich
materials
and
polyisocyanates
(
usually
tolylene
diisocyanate
)
.
Blowing
can
be
either
one
of
two
types
--
carbon
dioxide
gas
generated
by
the
reaction
of
water
on
the
polyisocyanate
or
mechanical
blowing
through
the
use
of
a
low-boiling
liquid
such
as
a
fluorinated
hydrocarbon
.
The
most
important
factor
in
determining
what
properties
the
end-product
will
have
is
quite
naturally
the
type
of
hydroxyl-rich
compound
that
is
used
in
its
production
.
Originally
,
the
main
types
used
were
various
compositions
of
polyesters
.
These
are
still
in
wide
use
today
,
particularly
in
semi-rigid
formulations
,
for
such
applications
as
cores
for
sandwich-type
structural
panels
,
foamed-in-place
insulation
,
automotive
safety
padding
,
arm
rests
,
etc.
.
More
recently
,
polyethers
--
again
in
varied
compositions
,
molecular
weights
,
and
branching
--
have
come
into
use
at
first
for
the
flexible
foams
,
just
lately
for
the
rigids
.
The
polyether
glycols
are
claimed
to
give
flexible
urethanes
a
spring-back
action
which
is
much
desired
in
cushioning
.
Although
the
first
polyether
foams
on
the
market
had
to
be
produced
by
the
two-step
prepolymer
method
,
today
,
thanks
to
new
catalysts
,
they
can
be
produced
by
a
one-shot
technique
.
It
is
possible
that
the
polyether
foams
may
soon
be
molded
on
a
production
basis
in
low-cost
molds
with
more
intricate
contours
and
with
superior
properties
to
latex
foam
.
The
polyester
urethane
foam
is
generally
produced
with
adipic
acid
polyesters
;
;
the
polyether
group
generally
consists
of
foams
produced
with
polypropylene
glycol
or
polypropylene
glycol
modified
with
a
triol
.
One
shot
vs.
prepolymer
In
the
prepolymer
system
,
the
isocyanate
and
resin
are
mixed
anhydrously
and
no
foaming
occurs
.
The
foaming
can
be
accomplished
at
some
future
time
at
a
different
location
by
the
addition
of
the
correct
proportion
of
catalyst
in
solution
.
In
one-shot
,
the
isocyanate
,
polyester
or
polyether
resin
,
catalyst
,
and
other
additives
are
mixed
directly
and
a
foam
is
produced
immediately
.
Basically
,
this
means
that
simpler
processing
equipment
(
the
mixture
has
good
flowing
characteristics
)
and
less
external
heat
(
the
foaming
reaction
is
exothermic
and
develops
internal
heat
)
are
required
in
one-shot
foaming
,
although
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
problems
of
controlling
the
conditions
of
one-shot
foaming
are
critical
ones
.
Properties
Most
commercial
uses
of
urethane
foams
require
densities
between
2
and
30
lb.
/
cu.
ft.
for
rigid
foams
,
between
1
and
3
lb.
/
cu.
ft.
for
flexible
foams
.
This
latter
figure
compares
with
latex
foam
rubber
at
an
average
of
5.5
lb.
/
cu.
ft.
in
commercial
grades
.
Compression
strength
:
Graph
in
Fig.
1
,
p.
392
,
indicates
how
the
ratio
of
compressive
strength
to
density
varies
as
the
latter
is
increased
or
decreased
.
The
single
curve
line
represents
a
specific
formulation
in
a
test
example
.
By
varying
the
formula
,
this
curve
may
be
moved
forward
or
backward
along
the
coordinates
to
produce
any
desired
compression
strength
/
density
ratio
.
Thermal
conductivity
and
temperature
resistance
:
In
flexible
urethane
foams
,
we
are
referring
to
the
range
between
the
highest
and
lowest
temperatures
under
which
the
materials'
primary
performance
remains
functionally
useful
.
In
temperature
resistance
,
this
quality
is
usually
related
to
specific
properties
,
e.g.
,
flexural
,
tensile
strengths
,
etc.
.
Thermal
conductivity
is
directly
traceable
to
the
material's
porous
,
air-cell
construction
which
effectively
traps
air
or
a
gas
in
the
maze
of
minute
bubbles
which
form
its
composition
.
These
air
or
gas
bubbles
make
highly
functional
thermal
barriers
.
The
K
factor
,
a
term
used
to
denote
the
rate
of
heat
transmission
through
a
material
(
B.t.u./sq.
ft.
of
material/hr./*0F./in.
of
thickness
)
ranges
from
0.24
to
0.28
for
flexible
urethane
foams
and
from
0.12
to
0.16
for
rigid
urethane
foams
,
depending
upon
the
formulation
,
density
,
cell
size
,
and
nature
of
blowing
agents
used
.
Table
1
,
,
p.
394
,
shows
a
comparison
of
K
factor
ratings
of
a
number
of
commercial
insulating
materials
in
common
use
,
including
two
different
types
of
rigid
urethane
foam
.
Flexural
strength
:
This
term
refers
to
the
ability
of
a
material
to
resist
bending
stress
and
is
determined
by
measuring
the
load
required
to
cause
failure
by
bending
.
The
higher-density
urethane
semi-rigid
foams
usually
have
stronger
flex
fatigue
resistance
,
i.e.
,
the
12
lb.
/
cu.
ft.
foam
has
8
times
the
flexural
strength
of
the
3
lb.
/
cu.
ft.
density
.
Note
that
flexural
strength
is
not
always
improved
by
simply
increasing
the
density
,
nor
is
the
change
always
proportional
from
one
formulation
to
another
.
Where
flexural
strength
is
an
important
factor
,
be
sure
that
your
urethane
foam
processor
is
aware
of
it
.
Tensile
strength
:
This
property
refers
to
the
greatest
longitudinal
stress
or
tension
a
material
can
endure
without
tearing
apart
.
(
like
compression
strength
of
urethane
foams
,
it
has
a
direct
relationship
to
formulation
.
)
Exceptional
tensile
strength
is
another
of
urethane
foam's
strong
features
.
Figure
2
,
above
,
shows
the
aging
properties
of
urethane
foams
as
determined
by
the
percent
of
change
in
tensile
strength
during
exposure
to
ultra-violet
light
.
Processing
urethanes
There
are
many
ways
of
producing
a
foamed
urethane
product
.
The
foam
can
be
made
into
slab
stock
and
cut
to
shape
,
it
can
be
molded
,
it
can
be
poured-in-place
,
it
can
be
applied
by
spray
guns
,
etc.
.
Slab
stock
is
still
one
of
the
most
important
forms
of
urethane
end-product
in
use
today
.
Basically
,
the
foam
machines
that
produce
such
stock
consist
of
two
or
more
pumping
units
,
a
variable
mixer
,
a
nozzle
carriage
assembly
,
and
,
in
many
cases
,
a
conveyor
belt
to
transport
and
contain
the
liquid
during
the
reaction
process
and
until
it
solidifies
into
foam
.
The
ingredients
are
fed
from
tanks
through
a
hose
and
into
the
mixer
at
a
predetermined
rate
.
The
mixing
head
moves
back
and
forth
slowly
across
the
width
of
the
receptacle
.
It
only
takes
a
few
minutes
for
the
foaming
action
to
be
completed
and
after
a
short
cure
,
the
material
can
be
cut
into
lengths
as
desired
.
Much
has
been
done
in
the
way
of
ingenious
slitters
to
fabricate
the
slab
stock
into
finished
products
.
Profile
cutting
machines
are
available
which
can
split
foam
to
any
desired
thickness
and
produce
sine
,
triangle
,
trapezoid
,
and
other
profiles
in
variable
heights
,
dimensions
,
etc.
.
The
convoluted
sheets
can
be
combined
to
attain
certain
cushioning
effects
mechanically
rather
than
chemically
.
Also
available
is
a
slitter
which
``
peels
''
the
inside
of
a
folded
block
of
foam
and
can
be
used
to
slit
continuous
sheets
up
to
300
yd.
in
length
,
down
to
1/16
in.
thick
.
The
low
cost
and
ease
of
fabrication
of
the
dies
for
three-dimensional
foam
cutting
plus
the
wide
variety
of
shapes
,
dimensions
,
and
contours
that
can
be
tailor-made
to
customer
requirements
has
made
the
technique
useful
for
producing
case
liners
,
materials
handling
containers
,
packaging
and
cushioning
devices
,
and
such
novelties
as
soap
dishes
,
toys
,
head
rests
,
arch
supports
,
and
gas
pedal
covers
.
Molding
Although
slab
stock
appeared
first
,
it
soon
became
apparent
that
for
the
production
of
cushions
with
irregular
shapes
,
crowned
contours
,
or
rounded
edges
,
the
cutting
of
slab
stock
is
a
wasteful
and
uneconomical
process
.
Only
by
resorting
to
molding
techniques
can
the
cushion
manufacturer
hope
to
compete
satisfactorily
in
the
established
cushion
market
.
The
closed
molding
of
flexible
urethane
foams
has
been
a
problem
ever
since
the
introduction
of
the
material
(
molding
in
open
molds
was
more
feasible
)
.
Satisfactory
methods
for
polyester
foams
and
even
prepolymer
polyether
foams
were
never
fully
achieved
.
Closed
molding
generally
resulted
in
parts
weighing
more
(
because
of
higher
density
)
than
parts
fabricated
from
free-blown
foams
.
This
counteracted
the
gain
from
having
no
scrap
loss
.
In
addition
,
there
were
difficulties
with
the
flow
and
spreading
of
the
foam
mixture
over
the
mold
surface
,
trouble
with
lack
of
gel
strength
in
the
rising
foam
,
and
problems
of
splits
.
The
introduction
of
one-shot
polyether
foam
systems
,
aided
by
the
development
of
new
catalysts
,
helped
to
alleviate
some
of
the
problems
of
closed
molding
.
While
there
are
still
many
bugs
to
be
ironed
out
,
the
technique
is
fast
developing
.
Other
techniques
Simple
systems
are
available
that
make
it
possible
for
urethane
foam
components
to
be
poured
,
pumped
,
etc.
,
into
a
void
where
they
foam
up
to
fill
the
void
.
In
a
typical
application
--
the
making
of
rigid
urethane
foam
sandwich
panels
--
an
amount
of
foam
mixture
calculated
to
expand
10
to
20%
more
than
the
volume
of
the
panel
is
poured
into
the
panel
void
and
the
top
of
the
panel
is
locked
in
place
by
a
jig
.
Temperature
of
the
wash
and
rinse
waters
is
maintained
at
85
-
90-degrees-F
(
29
-
32-degrees-C
)
.
The
top
rolls
are
loaded
with
40
lbs.
.
Sixty
lbs.
loading
is
possible
but
40
lbs.
is
adequate
.
The
suds
box
drain
is
arranged
at
the
start
to
deliver
into
the
raised
main
drain
pipe
(
thus
returning
suds
to
soap
box
)
and
the
machine
is
started
.
The
160-ml.
bath
containing
the
calculated
amount
of
detergent
is
applied
slowly
and
directly
to
the
running
specimen
.
Washing
is
continued
for
30
minutes
or
for
a
period
of
time
sufficient
to
allow
100
nips
or
passes
through
the
squeeze
rolls
.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
washing
,
8
liters
of
water
at
90-degrees-F
(
32*0C.
)
are
automatically
metered
from
the
rinse
reservoir
to
the
washing
tubs
,
4
liters
to
each
tub
.
This
operation
requires
from
10
to
12
minutes
.
During
the
rinsing
operation
the
volume
in
the
tubs
gradually
increases
until
overflow
from
the
main
drain
begins
.
At
this
point
the
drains
are
readjusted
so
that
the
suds
box
drain
will
discharge
directly
into
the
waste
line
and
the
main
tub
drain
is
set
at
the
2-1/2
mark
on
the
drain
gauge
.
When
all
of
the
rinse
water
has
passed
from
the
reservoir
to
the
tubs
the
main
drains
are
lowered
to
permit
complete
draining
of
the
tubs
.
The
run
is
complete
when
all
the
water
has
drained
off
into
the
waste
line
.
By
this
procedure
rinsing
progresses
in
two
stages
,
first
by
dilution
until
the
time
when
the
drains
are
separated
and
thereafter
by
displacement
of
the
soil-bearing
liquor
by
clean
rinse
water
,
since
soiled
liquor
squeezed
from
the
specimens
at
the
nip
passes
directly
to
waste
from
the
suds
box
drains
.
This
method
of
rinsing
appears
to
produce
maximum
cleansing
with
minimum
soil
redeposition
.
Suggested
evaluation
and
classification
Evaluation
may
be
made
on
either
a
soil-removal
or
a
grease-removal
basis
as
desired
.
A
reflectance-measuring
instrument
may
be
desirable
to
measure
cleaning
,
whereas
Soxhlet
extraction
is
necessary
to
measure
grease
removal
.
Purpose
and
scope
This
test
method
is
intended
for
determining
the
dimensional
changes
of
woven
or
knitted
fabrics
,
made
of
fibers
other
than
wool
,
to
be
expected
when
the
cloth
is
subjected
to
laundering
procedures
commonly
used
in
the
commercial
laundry
and
the
home
.
Four
washing
test
procedures
are
established
,
varying
in
severity
from
very
severe
to
very
mild
,
and
are
intended
to
cover
the
range
of
practical
washing
from
commercial
procedure
to
hand
washing
.
Five
drying
test
procedures
are
established
to
cover
the
range
of
drying
techniques
used
in
the
home
and
commercial
laundry
.
Three
methods
for
determining
the
dimensional
restorability
characteristics
are
established
for
those
textiles
which
require
restoration
by
ironing
or
wearing
after
laundering
.
These
tests
are
not
accelerated
and
must
be
repeated
to
evaluate
dimensional
changes
after
repeated
launderings
.
Table
1
,
summarizes
all
of
the
various
washing
,
drying
,
and
restoration
procedures
available
.
The
person
using
these
tests
must
determine
which
combination
of
procedures
is
practical
for
any
specific
item
in
order
to
evaluate
the
dimensional
changes
of
textile
fabrics
or
garments
after
laundering
procedures
commonly
used
in
the
home
or
commercial
laundry
.
It
is
possible
to
identify
the
test
procedure
completely
with
a
code
consisting
of
a
Roman
Numeral
,
a
letter
,
and
an
Arabic
number
.
For
example
Test

refers
to
a
specimen
which
has
been
washed
by
procedure
``

(
''
(
at
160-degrees-F
)
for
a
total
of
60
minutes
in
the
machine
,
has
been
dried
in
a
tumble
dryer
by
procedure
``

''
and
has
been
subjected
to
restorative
forces
on
the
Tension
Presser
by
procedure
``

''
.
Principle
A
specimen
or
garment
is
washed
in
a
cylindrical
reversing
wash
wheel
,
dried
and
subjected
to
restorative
forces
where
necessary
.
Temperature
and
time
of
agitation
in
the
wash
wheel
are
varied
to
obtain
different
degrees
of
severity
.
Drying
procedures
and
application
of
restorative
force
procedures
are
varied
to
conform
with
end-use
handling
during
home
or
commercial
laundering
.
Distances
marked
on
the
specimen
in
warp
and
filling
directions
(
or
wales
and
courses
for
knitted
fabrics
)
are
measured
before
and
after
laundering
.

with
the
apparatus
to
enable

Knit
shrinkage

--
consisting
of
a
set
of
20
mounting
pins
set
in
guides
in
radial
slots
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Each
pin
is
individually
sprung
to
a
tensioning
member
which
is
driven
outwardly
in
the
slot
.
The
springs
have
an
extension
of
1
inch
at
Af
tension
.
The
tensioning
members
have
a
common
drive
so
that
the
application
of
restorative
force
takes
place
simultaneously
in
all
directions
in
the
plane
of
the
test
specimen
.
The
minimum
diameter
of
the
pin
frame
in
the
collapsed
state
is
11
inches
and
the
maximum
diameter
in
the
freely
extended
state
(
unloaded
)
is
14
inches
.
The
surface
of
the
apparatus
in
contact
with
the
test
specimen
is
uncluttered
and
polished
so
as
to
be
as
friction-free
as
possible
.
Test
specimens
The
preparation
of
test
specimens
will
vary
depending
upon
the
type
of
dimensional
restorability
procedure
(
if
any
)
to
be
used
.
Three
specimens
for
each
sample
to
be
tested
are
required
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
satisfactory
average
of
performance
.
This
is
especially
true
for
knitted
fabrics
.
Specimens
are
allowed
to
reach
moisture
equilibrium
with
a
standard
atmosphere
of
Af
and
Af
and
then
laid
out
without
tension
on
a
flat
,
polished
surface
,
care
being
taken
that
the
fabric
is
free
from
wrinkles
or
creases
.
Fabrics
that
are
badly
distorted
in
their
unlaundered
state
due
to
faulty
finishing
may
give
deceptive
dimensional
change
results
when
laundered
by
any
procedure
.
This
also
holds
true
if
restorative
forces
are
applied
.
Therefore
,
it
is
recommended
that
in
such
cases
the
sample
be
replaced
,
or
if
used
,
the
results
of
dimensional
change
or
dimensional
restorability
tests
be
considered
as
indicative
only
.
Generally
,
it
is
necessary
to
mark
distances
on
a
specimen
(
or
garment
)
in
both
lengthwise
and
widthwise
directions
and
to
measure
before
and
after
laundering
.
The
distances
may
be
marked
with
indelible
ink
and
a
fine-point
pen
,
by
sewing
fine
threads
into
the
fabric
,
or
by
a
specially
designed
stamping
machine
.
The
marked
distances
are
parallel
to
the
respective
yarns
.
Usually
,
the
greater
the
original
distances
marked
,
the
greater
will
be
the
accuracy
of
the
test
.
Distances
of
less
than
10
inches
are
not
recommended
.

High-gain
,
photoelectronic
image
intensification
is
applied
under
conditions
of
low
incident
light
levels
whenever
the
integration
time
required
by
a
sensor
or
recording
instrument
exceeds
the
limits
of
practicability
.
Examples
of
such
situations
are
(
aerial
)
night
reconnaissance
,
the
recording
of
radioactive
tracers
in
live
body
tissues
,
special
radiography
in
medical
or
industrial
applications
,
track
recording
of
high
energy
particles
,
etc.
.
High-gain
photoelectronic
image
intensification
may
be
achieved
by
several
methods
;
;
some
of
these
are
listed
below
:
(
A
)
Cascading
single
stages
by
coupling
lens
systems
,
(
B
)
Channel-type
,
secondary
emission
image
intensifier
,
(
C
)
Image
intensifier
based
upon
the
``
multipactor
''
principle
,
(

)
Transmission
secondary

multiplication
image
intensifiers
(
TSEM
tubes
)
,
(
E
)
Cascading
of
single
stages
,
enclosed
in
one
common
envelope
.
Cascading
single
stages
by
coupling
lens
systems
is
rather
inefficient
as
the
lens
systems
limit
the
obtainable
gain
quite
severely
.
Channel-type
image
intensifiers
are
capable
of
achieving
high-gain
values
;
;
they
suffer
,
however
,
from
an
inherently
low
resolution
.
Image
intensifiers
based
upon
the
multipactor
principle
appear
to
hold
promise
as
far
as
obtainable
resolution
is
concerned
.
However
,
the
unavoidable
low-duty
cycle
restricts
the
effective
gain
.
TSEM
tubes
have
been
constructed
showing
high
gain
and
resolution
.
However
,
electrostatic
focus
,
important
for
many
applications
,
has
not
been
realized
for
these
devices
.
Resolution
limitations
with
electrostatic
focus
might
be
anticipated
due
to
chromatic
aberrations
.
Furthermore
,
the
thin
film
dynodes
appear
to
have
a
natural
diameter
limitation
wherever
a
mesh
support
cannot
be
tolerated
.
Cascaded
single
stages
enclosed
by
a
common
envelope
have
been
constructed
with
high
gain
and
high
resolution
.
These
tubes
may
differ
both
in
the
choice
of
the
electron
optical
system
and
in
the
design
of
the
coupling
members
.
The
electron
optical
system
may
be
either
a
magnetic
or
electrostatic
one
.
The
magnification
may
be
smaller
,
equal
,
or
larger
than
unity
.
An
electrostatic
system
suffers
generally
from
image
plane
curvature
leading
to
defocusing
in
the
peripheral
image
region
if
a
flat
viewing
screen
(
or
interstage
coupler
)
is
utilized
,
while
a
magnetic
system
requires
accurate
adjustment
of
the
solenoid
,
which
is
heavy
and
bulky
.
As
it
will
be
discussed
later
,
peripheral
defocusing
can
be
improved
on
by
utilizing
curved
fiber
couplers
.
It
should
be
noted
,
however
,
that
the
paraxial
resolution
is
quite
similar
for
both
electron
optical
systems
.
It
is
felt
that
fiber-coupled
double-
(
and
multi-
)
stage
image
intensifiers
will
gain
considerable
importance
in
the
future
.
Therefore
,
we
shall
consider
in
this
paper
the
theoretical
gain
and
resolution
capabilities
of
such
tubes
.
The
luminous
efficiency
and
resolution
of
single
stages
,
fiber
couplers
,
and
finally
of
the
composite
tube
will
be
computed
.
It
will
be
shown
theoretically
that
the
high
image
intensification
obtainable
with
such
a
tube
and
contact
photography
permits
the
utilization
of
extremely
low
incident
light
levels
.
The
effect
of
device
and
quantum
noise
,
associated
with
such
low
input
levels
,
will
be
described
.
After
these
theoretical
considerations
,
constructional
details
of
a
fiber-coupled
,
double-stage
X-ray
image
intensifier
will
be
discussed
.
Measured
performance
characteristics
for
this
experimental
tube
will
be
listed
.
The
conclusion
shall
be
reached
that
fiber-coupled
,
double-stage
tubes
represent
a
sensible
and
practical
approach
to
high-gain
image
intensification
.
Basic
design
of
a
fiber-coupled
,
double-stage
image
intensifier
The
tube
design
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
theoretical
discussion
shall
be
described
now
.
The
electron
optical
system
(
see
fig.
14-1
)
is
based
in
principle
on
the
focusing
action
of
concentric
spherical
cathode
and
anode
surfaces
.
The
inner
(
anode
)
sphere
is
pierced
,
elongated
into
a
cup
,
and
terminated
by
the
phosphor
screen
.
The
photoelectrons
emitted
from
a
circular
segment
of
the
cathode
sphere
are
focused
by
the
positive
lens
action
of
the
two
concentric
spheres
,
pass
through
the
(
negative
)
lens
formed
by
the
anode
aperture
,
and
impinge
upon
the
cathodoluminescent
viewing
screen
.
The
cylindrical
focusing
electrode
permits
adjustment
of
the
positive
lens
part
by
varying
the
focusing
potential
.
The
anode
potential
codetermines
the
gain
,
G
,
and
magnification
,
M
,
of
the
stage
.
Both
the
photocathode
and
the
image
plane
of
such
an
electrode
configuration
are
curved
concave
as
seen
from
the
anode
aperture
.
The
field-flattening
property
of
the
biconcave
fiber
coupler
can
be
utilized
to
alleviate
the
peripheral
resolution
losses
resulting
with
a
flat
phosphor-screen
or
coupling
member
.
For
the
same
reason
,
the
output
fiber
plate
is
planoconcave
,
its
exposed
flat
side
permitting
contact
photography
if
a
permanent
record
is
desired
.
As
it
will
be
shown
later
,
the
field-flattening
properties
of
the
interstage
and
output
fiber
coupler
comprise
indeed
the
main
advantage
of
such
a
design
.
The
second
photocathode
and
both
phosphor
surfaces
are
deposited
on
the
fiber
plate
substrates
.
The
photocathode
sensitivities
S
,
phosphor
efficiencies
P
,
and
anode
potentials
V
of
the
individual
stages
shall
be
distinguished
by
means
of
subscripts
1
,
and
2
,
in
the
text
,
where
required
.
Both
stages
are
assumed
to
have
unity
magnification
.
Theoretical
discussion
of
flux
gain
flux
gain
of
a
single
stage
The
luminous
gain
of
a
single
stage
with
Af
(
flux
gain
)
is
,
to
a
first
approximation
,
given
by
the
product
of
the
photocathode
sensitivity
S
(
amp
/
lumen
)
,
the
anode
potential
V
(
volts
)
,
and
the
phosphor
conversion
efficiency
P
(
lumen/watt
)
.
In
general
,
P
is
a
function
of
V
and
the
current
density
,
but
it
shall
here
be
assumed
as
a
constant
.
The
luminous
efficiency
Af
of
a
photocathode
depends
on
the
maximum
radiant
sensitivity
Af
and
on
the
spectral
distribution
of
the
incident
light
Af
by
the
relation
:
Af
where
Af
is
normalized
radiant
photocathode
sensitivity
.
Af
is
standard
visibility
function
.
The
luminous
flux
gain
of
a
single
stage
is
given
by
:
Af
.
If
the
input
light
distribution
falls
beyond
the
visible
range
,
Af
as
expected
,
since
Af
.
Such
cases
are
not
considered
here
.
Efficiency
of
fiber
couplers
The
efficiency
of
fiber
optics
plates
depends
on
four
factors
:
(
A
)
numerical
aperture
(
N.A.
)
;
;
(
B
)
end
(
Fresnel
reflection
)
losses
(
R
)
;
;
(
C
)
internal
losses
(
I.L.
)
;
;
(
D
)
packing
efficiency
(
F.R.
)
.
The
numerical
aperture
of
the
fibers
is
given
by
:
Af
where
Af
.
The
angle
Af
is
measured
in
the
medium
of
index
Af
.
Settled
phosphors
,
as
generally
used
in
image
intensifiers
,
have
low
optical
contact
with
the
substrate
surface
,
hence
Af
shall
be
assumed
.
The
numerical
aperture
should
be
in
general
close
to
unity
.
This
condition
can
be
satisfied
,
e.g.
,
with
Af
and
Af
or
equivalent
glass
combinations
.
A
sufficiently
good
approximation
for
determining
the
end
reflection
losses
R
can
be
obtained
from
the
angle
independent
Fresnel
formula
:
Af
.
For
phosphor
to
fiber
and
fiber
to
air
surfaces
,
and
assuming
Af
,
we
obtain
Af
percent
.
This
value
may
be
reduced
to
4.6
percent
by
means
of
a
(
very
thin
)
glass
layer
of
index
1.5
.
Hence
,
the
Af
factor
for
the
output
fiber
coupler
is
Af
.
As
the
index
of
refraction
of
photosensitive
surfaces
of
the
SbCs-type
lies
around
2
,
the
Fresnel
losses
at
the
fiber-photocathode
interface
are
about
0.5
percent
and
the
Af
factor
for
the
interstage
coupler
is
0.95
.
It
might
be
anticipated
that
multiple
coatings
will
reduce
end
reflection
losses
even
further
.
The
internal
losses
are
due
to
absorption
and
the
small
but
finite
losses
suffered
in
the
numerous
internal
reflections
due
to
deviations
from
the
prescribed
,
cylindrical
fiber
cross-section
and
minute
imperfections
of
the
core-jacket
interface
.
These
losses
depend
on
fiber
diameter
and
length
,
absorption
coefficient
,
the
mean
value
of
the
loss
per
internal
reflection
and
last
,
but
not
least
,
on
the
angular
distribution
of
the
incident
light
.
Explicit
expressions
(
integral
averages
)
are
given
in
the
literature
.
Lacking
reliable
data
for
some
of
the
variables
,
we
are
relying
on
experimental
data
of
about
20
percent
internal
losses
for
1/4-inch
long
,
small
(
5
-
10
M
)
diameter
fibers
.
This
relatively
high
value
is
probably
due
to
the
small
fiber
diameters
increasing
the
number
of
internal
reflections
.
Since
we
are
considering
here
relatively
small
diameter
(
1
-
1.5
inches
)
fiber
plates
,
their
average
thickness
can
be
kept
below
1/4
inch
and
their
internal
losses
may
be
assumed
as
15
percent
(
per
plate
)
.
The
packing
efficiency
,
F.R.
,
of
fiber
plates
did
not
receive
much
attention
in
the
literature
,
probably
as
it
is
high
for
the
larger
fibers
generally
used
,
until
rather
recently
.
For
circular
fibers
in
a
closely
packed
hexagonal
array
,
the
packing
efficiency
is
given
by
:
Af
where
Af
,
and
0.906
is
the
ratio
of
the
area
of
a
circle
to
that
of
the
circumscribed
hexagon
.
For
the
small
diameter
fibers
now
technically
feasible
and
required
for
about
100
Af
resolution
,
Af
.
The
cladding
thickness
is
about
0.5
M
,
hence
,
Af
and
Af
.
Thus
,
the
efficiency
**yt
couplers
is
given
by
--
Af
or
approximately
50
percent
each
.
It
must
be
remembered
that
the
fiber
plates
replace
a
glass
window
and
a
(
mica
)
membrane
,
in
addition
to
an
optical
output
lens
system
.
The
efficiency
Af
of
an
Af
lens
at
the
magnification
Af
is
:
Af
.
Neglecting
absorption
,
the
end
losses
of
the
coupling
membrane
and
the
output
window
Af
would
be
6
percent
and
8
percent
.
Thus
,
the
combined
efficiency
of
the
elements
replaced
by
the
two
fiber
plates
(
with
a
combined
efficiency
of
0.25
)
is
0.043
or
about
six
times
less
than
that
of
the
two
fiber
plates
.
Gain
of
fiber
coupled
image
intensifiers
Including
the
brightness
gain
Af
due
to
the
Af
area
demagnification
,
the
overall
gain
of
a
fiber
coupled
double
stage
image
intensifier
is
:
Af
.
It
is
obvious
that
the
careful
choice
of
photocathode
which
maximizes
Af
for
a
given
input
E
(
in
the
case
of
the
second
stage
,
for
the
first
phosphor
screen
emission
)
is
very
important
.
The
same
consideration
should
govern
the
choice
of
the
second-stage
phosphor
screen
for
matching
with
the
spectral
sensitivity
of
the
ultimate
sensor
(
e.g.
,
photographic
emulsion
)
.
We
have
evaluated
the
``
matching
integrals
''
for
two
types
of
photocathodes
(
S-11
and
S-20
)
and
three
types
of
light
input
.
The
input
light
distributions
considered
are
P-11
and
P-20
phosphor
emission
and
the
so-called
``
night
light
''
(
N.L.
)
as
given
by
H.W.
Babcock
and
J.
J.
Johnson
.
The
integrals
(
in
units
)
are
listed
in
table
14-1
,
below
.
Theoretical
discussion
of
paraxial
device
resolution
resolution
limitations
in
a
single
stage
The
resolution
limitations
for
a
single
stage
are
given
by
the
inherent
resolution
of
the
electron
optical
system
as
well
as
the
resolution
capabilities
of
the
cathodoluminescent
viewing
screen
.
The
resolution
capabilities
of
an
electrostatic
system
depend
on
both
the
choice
of
magnification
and
chromatic
aberrations
.
It
has
been
stated
previously
that
a
minifying
electrostatic
system
yields
a
lower
resolution
than
a
magnifying
system
or
a
system
with
unity
magnification
.
Furthermore
,
the
chromatic
aberrations
depend
on
the
chosen
high
voltage
.
In
general
,
a
high
anode
voltage
reduces
chromatic
aberrations
and
thus
increases
the
obtainable
resolution
.
The
luminous
gain
of
the
discussed
tube
was
calculated
from
Eq.
(
6
)
for
the
16
possible
combinations
of
S-11
and
S-20
photocathodes
and
P-11
and
P-20
phosphor
screens
,
for
night
light
and
P-20
light
input
.
(
The
P-20
input
is
of
interest
because
it
corresponds
roughly
to
the
light
emission
of
conventional
X-ray
fluorescent
screens
)
.
The
following
efficiencies
obtained
from
JEDEC
and
RCA
specifications
were
used
:
Af
.
The
following
table
(
14-2
)
lists
the
(
luminous
)
gain
values
computed
according
to
Eq.
(
6
)
with
Af
.
The
possibility
of
a
space
charge
blowup
of
the
screen
crossover
of
the
elementary
electron
bundles
has
been
pointed
out
.
It
is
obvious
that
such
an
influence
can
only
be
expected
in
the
final
stage
of
an
image
intensifier
at
rather
high
output
levels
.
Space
charge
influences
will
also
decrease
at
increased
voltages
.
Electrostatic
systems
of
the
pseudo-symmetric
type
have
been
tested
for
resolution
capabilities
by
applying
electronography
.
A
resolution
of
70
-
80
line-pairs
per
millimeter
appears
to
be
feasible
.
The
inherent
resolution
of
a
cathodoluminescent
phosphor
screen
decreases
with
increasingly
aggregate
thickness
(
with
increasing
anode
voltage
)
,
decreases
with
decreasing
porosity
(
thus
the
advantage
of
cathodophoretic
phosphor
deposition
)
and
might
be
impaired
by
the
normally
used
aluminum
mirror
.
Thus
,
in
general
,
elementary
light
optical
effects
,
light
scatter
,
and
electron
scatter
determine
the
obtainable
resolution
limit
.
It
should
be
noted
that
photoluminescence
,
due
to
``
Bremsstrahlung
''
generated
within
the
viewing
screen
by
electron
impact
,
appears
to
be
important
only
if
anode
voltages
in
excess
of
30
KV
are
utilized
.
It
has
been
stated
that
settled
cathodoluminescent
phosphor
screens
may
have
a
limiting
resolution
of
60
Af
at
high
voltage
values
of
approximately
20
Aj
.
For
the
further
discussion
,
we
shall
thus
assume
an
electron
optical
resolution
of
80
Af
and
phosphor
screen
resolution
of
60
Af
.
The
set
of
all
decisions
is
called
the
operating
policy
or
,
more
simply
,
the
policy
.
An
optimal
policy
is
one
which
in
some
sense
gets
the
best
out
of
the
process
as
a
whole
by
maximizing
the
value
of
the
product
.
There
are
thus
three
components
to
an
optimal
design
problem
:
(
1
)
The
specification
of
the
state
of
the
process
stream
;
;
(
2
)
The
specification
of
the
operating
variables
and
the
transformation
they
effect
;
;
(
3
)
The
specification
of
the
objective
function
of
which
the
optimization
is
desired
.
For
a
chemical
process
the
first
of
these
might
involve
the
concentrations
of
the
different
chemical
species
,
and
the
temperature
or
pressure
of
the
stream
.
For
the
second
we
might
have
to
choose
the
volume
of
reactor
or
amount
of
cooling
to
be
supplied
;
;
the
way
in
which
the
transformation
of
state
depends
on
the
operating
variables
for
the
main
types
of
reactors
is
discussed
in
the
next
chapter
.
The
objective
function
is
some
measure
of
the
increase
in
value
of
the
stream
by
processing
;
;
it
is
the
subject
of
Chapter
4
.
The
essential
characteristic
of
an
optimal
policy
when
the
state
of
the
stream
is
transformed
in
a
sequence
of
stages
with
no
feedback
was
first
isolated
by
Bellman
.
He
recognized
that
whatever
transformation
may
be
effected
in
the
first
stage
of
an
R-stage
process
,
the
remaining
stages
must
use
an
optimal
Af-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
state
resulting
from
the
first
stage
,
if
there
is
to
be
any
chance
of
optimizing
the
complete
process
.
Moreover
,
by
systematically
varying
the
operating
conditions
in
the
first
stage
and
always
using
the
optimal
Af-stage
policy
for
the
remaining
stages
,
we
shall
eventually
find
the
optimal
policy
for
all
R
stages
.
Proceeding
in
this
way
,
from
one
to
two
and
from
two
to
three
stages
,
we
may
gradually
build
up
the
policy
for
any
number
.
At
each
step
of
the
calculation
the
operating
variables
of
only
one
stage
need
be
varied
.
To
see
how
important
this
economy
is
,
let
us
suppose
that
there
are
M
operating
variables
at
each
stage
and
that
the
state
is
specified
by
N
variables
;
;
then
the
search
for
the
maximum
at
any
one
stage
will
require
a
number
of
operations
of
order
Af
(
where
a
is
some
number
not
unreasonably
large
)
.
To
proceed
from
one
stage
to
the
next
a
sufficient
number
of
feed
states
must
be
investigated
to
allow
for
interpolation
;
;
this
number
will
be
of
the
order
of
Af
.
If
,
however
,
we
are
seeking
the
optimal
R-stage
policy
for
a
given
feed
state
,
only
one
search
for
a
maximum
is
required
at
the
final
step
.
Thus
a
number
of
operations
of
the
order
of
Af
are
required
.
If
all
the
operating
variables
were
varied
simultaneously
,
Af
operations
would
be
required
to
do
the
same
job
,
and
as
R
increases
this
increases
very
much
more
rapidly
than
the
number
of
operations
required
by
the
dynamic
program
.
But
even
more
important
than
this
is
the
fact
that
the
direct
search
by
simultaneously
varying
all
operating
conditions
has
produced
only
one
optimal
policy
,
namely
,
that
for
the
given
feed
state
and
R
stages
.
In
contrast
,
the
dynamic
program
produces
this
policy
and
a
whole
family
of
policies
for
any
smaller
number
of
stages
.
If
the
problem
is
enlarged
to
require
a
complete
coverage
of
feed
states
,
Af
operations
are
needed
by
the
dynamic
program
and
Af
by
the
direct
search
.
But
Af
is
vastly
larger
than
R
.
No
optimism
is
more
baseless
than
that
which
believes
that
the
high
speed
of
modern
digital
computers
allows
for
use
of
the
crudest
of
methods
in
searching
out
a
result
.
Suppose
that
Af
,
and
that
the
average
operation
requires
only
Af
sec.
.
Then
the
dynamic
program
would
require
about
a
minute
whereas
the
direct
search
would
take
more
than
three
millennia
!
!
The
principle
of
optimality
thus
brings
a
vital
organization
into
the
search
for
the
optimal
policy
of
a
multistage
decision
process
.
Bellman
(
1957
)
has
annunciated
in
the
following
terms
:
``
An
optimal
policy
has
the
property
that
whatever
the
initial
state
and
initial
decision
are
,
the
remaining
decisions
must
constitute
an
optimal
policy
with
respect
to
the
state
resulting
from
the
first
decision
''
.
This
is
the
principle
which
we
will
invoke
in
every
case
to
set
up
a
functional
equation
.
It
appears
in
a
form
that
is
admirably
suited
to
the
powers
of
the
digital
computer
.
At
the
same
time
,
every
device
that
can
be
employed
to
reduce
the
number
of
variables
is
of
the
greatest
value
,
and
it
is
one
of
the
attractive
features
of
dynamic
programming
that
room
is
left
for
ingenuity
in
using
the
special
features
of
the
problem
to
this
end
.
2.2
the
discrete
deterministic
process
Consider
the
process
illustrated
in
Fig.
2.1
,
consisting
of
R
distinct
stages
.
These
will
be
numbered
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
flow
of
the
process
stream
,
so
that
stage
R
is
the
T
stage
from
the
end
.
Let
the
state
of
the
stream
leaving
stage
R
be
denoted
by
a
vector
Af
and
the
operating
variables
of
stage
R
by
Af
.
Thus
Af
denotes
the
state
of
the
feed
to
the
R-stage
process
,
and
Af
the
state
of
the
product
from
the
last
stage
.
Each
stage
transforms
the
state
Af
of
its
feed
to
the
state
Af
in
a
way
that
depends
on
the
operating
variables
Af
.
We
write
this
Af
.
This
transformation
is
uniquely
determined
by
Af
and
we
therefore
speak
of
the
process
as
deterministic
.
In
practical
situations
there
will
be
restrictions
on
the
admissible
operating
conditions
,
and
we
regard
the
vectors
as
belonging
to
a
fixed
and
bounded
set
S
.
The
set
of
vectors
Af
constitutes
the
operating
policy
or
,
more
briefly
,
the
policy
,
and
a
policy
is
admissible
if
all
the
Af
belong
to
S
.
When
the
policy
has
been
chosen
,
the
state
of
the
product
can
be
obtained
from
the
state
of
the
feed
by
repeated
application
of
the
transformation
(
1
)
;
;
thus
Af
.
The
objective
function
,
which
is
to
be
maximized
,
is
some
function
,
usually
piecewise
continuous
,
of
the
product
state
.
Let
this
be
denoted
by
Af
.
An
optimal
policy
is
an
admissible
policy
Af
which
maximizes
the
objective
function
P
.
The
policy
may
not
be
unique
but
the
maximum
value
of
P
certainly
is
,
and
once
the
policy
is
specified
this
maximum
can
be
calculated
by
(
2
)
and
(
3
)
as
a
function
of
the
feed
state
Af
.
Let
Af
where
the
maximization
is
over
all
admissible
policies
Af
.
When
it
is
necessary
to
be
specific
we
say
that
the
optimal
policy
is
an
optimal
R-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
feed
state
Af
.
For
any
choice
of
admissible
policy
Af
in
the
first
stage
,
the
state
of
the
stream
leaving
this
stage
is
given
by
Af
.
This
is
the
feed
state
of
the
subsequent
Af
stages
which
,
according
to
the
principle
of
optimality
,
must
use
an
optimal
Af-stage
policy
with
respect
to
this
state
.
This
will
result
in
a
value
Af
of
the
objective
function
,
and
when
Af
is
chosen
correctly
this
will
give
Af
,
the
maximum
of
the
objective
function
.
Thus
Af
where
the
maximization
is
over
all
admissible
policies
Af
,
and
Af
is
related
to
Af
by
(
5
)
.
The
sequence
of
equations
(
6
)
can
be
solved
for
Af
when
Af
is
known
,
and
clearly
Af
,
the
maximization
being
over
all
admissible
Af
.
The
set
of
equations
(
5
)
,
(
6
)
,
and
the
starting
equation
(
7
)
is
of
a
recursive
type
well
suited
to
programming
on
the
digital
computer
.
In
finding
the
optimal
R-stage
policy
from
that
of
Af
stages
,
only
the
function
Af
is
needed
.
When
Af
has
been
found
it
may
be
transferred
into
the
storage
location
of
Af
and
the
whole
calculation
repeated
.
We
also
see
how
the
results
may
be
presented
,
although
if
n
,
the
number
of
state
variables
,
is
large
any
tabulation
will
become
cumbersome
.
A
table
or
set
of
tables
may
be
set
out
as
in
Table
2.1
.
To
extract
the
optimal
R-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
feed
state
Af
,
we
enter
section
R
of
this
table
at
the
state
Af
and
find
immediately
from
the
last
column
the
maximum
value
of
the
objective
function
.
In
the
third
column
is
given
the
optimal
policy
for
stage
R
,
and
in
the
fourth
,
the
resulting
state
of
the
stream
when
this
policy
is
used
.
Since
by
the
principle
of
optimality
the
remaining
stages
use
an
optimal
Af-stage
policy
with
respect
to
Af
,
we
may
enter
section
Af
of
the
table
at
this
state
Af
and
read
off
the
optimal
policy
for
stage
Af
and
the
resulting
state
Af
.
Proceeding
in
this
way
up
the
table
we
extract
the
complete
optimal
policy
and
,
if
it
is
desired
,
we
can
check
on
Af
by
evaluating
Af
at
the
last
stage
.
It
may
be
that
the
objective
function
depends
not
only
on
Af
but
also
on
Af
,
as
when
the
cost
of
the
operating
policy
is
considered
.
A
moment's
reflection
shows
that
the
above
algorithm
and
presentation
work
equally
well
in
this
case
.
A
form
of
objective
function
that
we
shall
often
have
occasion
to
consider
is
Af
.
Here
P
represents
the
value
of
the
stream
in
state
P
and
Q
the
cost
of
operating
the
stage
with
conditions
Q
.
Hence
P
is
the
increase
in
value
of
the
stream
minus
the
cost
of
operation
,
that
is
,
the
net
profit
.
If
Af
denotes
the
net
profit
from
stage
R
and
Af
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
gives
Af
.
This
sequence
of
equations
may
be
started
with
the
remark
that
with
no
process
Af
there
is
no
profit
,
i.e.
,
Af
.
2.3
the
discrete
stochastic
process
The
process
in
which
the
outcome
of
any
one
stage
is
known
only
statistically
is
also
of
interest
,
although
for
chemical
reactor
design
it
is
not
as
important
as
the
deterministic
process
.
In
this
case
the
stage
R
operating
with
conditions
Af
transforms
the
state
of
the
stream
from
Af
to
Af
,
but
only
the
probability
distribution
of
Af
is
known
.
This
is
specified
by
a
distribution
function
Af
such
that
the
probability
that
Af
lies
in
some
region
D
of
the
stage
space
is
Af
.
We
cannot
now
speak
of
maximizing
the
value
of
the
objective
function
,
since
this
function
is
now
known
only
in
a
probabilistic
sense
.
We
can
,
however
,
maximize
its
expected
value
.
For
a
single
stage
we
may
define
Af
where
the
maximization
is
by
choice
of
Af
.
We
thus
have
an
optimal
policy
which
maximizes
the
expected
value
of
the
objective
function
for
a
given
Af
.
If
we
consider
a
process
in
which
the
outcome
of
one
stage
is
known
before
passage
to
the
next
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
shows
that
the
policy
in
subsequent
stages
should
be
optimal
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
the
first
.
Then
Af
,
the
maximization
being
over
all
admissible
Af
and
the
integration
over
the
whole
of
stage
space
.
The
type
of
presentation
of
results
used
in
the
deterministic
process
may
be
used
here
,
except
that
now
the
fourth
column
is
redundant
.
The
third
column
gives
the
optimal
policy
,
but
we
must
wait
to
see
the
outcome
of
stage
R
and
enter
the
preceding
section
of
the
table
at
this
state
.
The
discussion
of
the
optimal
policy
when
the
outcome
of
one
stage
is
not
known
before
passing
to
the
next
is
a
very
much
more
difficult
matter
.
2.4
the
continuous
deterministic
process
In
many
cases
it
is
not
possible
to
divide
the
process
into
a
finite
number
of
discrete
stages
,
since
the
state
of
the
stream
is
transformed
in
a
continuous
manner
through
the
process
.
We
replace
r
,
the
number
of
the
stage
from
the
end
of
the
process
,
by
t
,
a
continuous
variable
which
measures
the
``
distance
''
of
the
point
considered
from
the
end
of
the
process
.
The
word
distance
is
used
here
in
a
rather
general
sense
;
;
it
may
in
fact
be
the
time
that
will
elapse
before
the
end
of
the
process
.
If
T
is
the
total
``
length
''
of
the
process
,
its
feed
state
may
be
denoted
by
a
vector
p(T)
and
the
product
state
by
p(Q)
.
P
denotes
the
state
at
any
point
T
and
Q
the
vector
of
operating
variables
there
.
A
gyro-stabilized
platform
system
,
using
restrained
gyros
,
is
well
suited
for
automatic
leveling
because
of
the
characteristics
of
the
gyro-platform-servo
combination
.
The
restrained
gyro-stabilized
platform
with
reasonable
response
characteristics
operates
with
an
approximate
equation
of
motion
,
neglecting
transient
effects
,
as
follows
:
Af
where
U
is
a
torque
applied
about
the
output
axis
of
the
controlling
gyro
.
