of
America
,
with
respect

is
as
follows
:
(

(
C
)
of
Article
2
,
of
the
Agreement
upon
the
presentation
of
such
documentation
as
the
United
States
may
specify
.
(
2
)
The
Government
of
India
shall
maintain
or
cause
to
be
maintained
books
and
records
adequate
to
identify
the
goods
and
services
financed
for
agreed
projects
pursuant
to
paragraphs
1
(
B
)
and
1
(
C
)
of
Article
2
,
of
the
Agreement
,
to
disclose
the
use
thereof
in
the
projects
and
to
record
the
progress
of
the
projects
(
including
the
cost
thereof
)
.
The
books
and
records
with
respect
to
each
project
shall
be
maintained
for
the
duration
of
the
project
,
or
until
the
expiration
of
three
years
after
final
disbursement
for
the
project
has
been
made
by
the
United
States
,
whichever
is
later
.
The
two
Governments
shall
have
the
right
at
all
reasonable
times
to
examine
such
books
and
records
and
all
other
documents
,
correspondence
,
memoranda
and
other
records
involving
transactions
relating
to
agreed
projects
.
The
Government
of
India
shall
enable
the
authorized
representatives
of
the
United
States
to
observe
and
review
agreed
projects
and
the
utilization
of
goods
and
services
financed
under
the
projects
,
and
shall
furnish
to
the
United
States
all
such
information
as
it
shall
reasonably
request
concerning
the
above-mentioned
matters
and
the
expenditures
related
thereto
.
This
broad
delegation
leaves
within
our
discretion
(
subject
to
the
always-present
criterion
of
the
public
interest
)
both
the
determination
of
what
degree
of
interference
shall
be
considered
excessive
,
and
the
methods
by
which
such
excessive
interference
shall
be
avoided
.
3
.
The
present
proceeding
is
concerned
with
the
standard
broadcast
(
AM
)
band
,
from
540
kc.
to
1600
kc.
.
Whenever
two
or
more
standard
broadcast
stations
operate
simultaneously
on
the
same
or
closely
adjacent
frequencies
,
each
interferes
to
some
extent
with
reception
of
the
other
.
The
extent
of
such
interference
--
which
may
be
so
slight
as
to
be
undetectable
at
any
point
where
either
of
the
stations
renders
a
usable
signal
,
or
may
be
so
great
as
to
virtually
destroy
the
service
areas
of
both
stations
--
depends
on
many
factors
,
among
the
principal
ones
being
the
distance
between
the
stations
,
their
respective
radiated
power
,
and
,
of
particular
significance
here
,
the
time
of
day
.
Other
factors
playing
a
part
in
the
extent
of
AM
service
and
interference
are
the
frequency
involved
,
the
time
of
year
,
the
position
of
the
year
in
the
sunspot
cycle
,
ground
conductivity
along
the
transmission
path
,
atmospheric
and
manmade
noise
,
and
others
.
With
the
existence
of
these
many
factors
,
some
of
them
variable
,
it
obviously
has
never
been
and
is
not
now
possible
for
the
Commission
to
make
assignments
of
AM
stations
on
a
case-to-case
basis
which
will
insure
against
any
interference
in
any
circumstances
.
Rather
,
such
assignments
are
made
,
as
they
must
be
,
on
the
basis
of
certain
overall
rules
and
standards
,
representing
to
some
extent
a
statistical
approach
to
the
problem
,
taking
into
account
for
each
situation
some
of
the
variables
(
e.g.
,
power
and
station
separations
)
and
averaging
out
others
in
order
to
achieve
the
balance
which
must
be
struck
between
protection
against
destructive
interference
and
the
assignment
of
a
number
of
stations
large
enough
to
afford
optimum
radio
service
to
the
Nation
.
An
example
of
the
overall
standards
applied
is
the
20-to-1
ratio
established
for
the
determination
of
that
degree
of
cochannel
interference
which
is
regarded
as
objectionable
.
By
this
standard
,
it
is
determined
that
where
two
stations
operating
on
the
same
frequency
are
involved
,
objectionable
interference
from
station
A
exists
at
any
point
within
the
service
area
of
station
B
where
station
A's
signal
is
of
an
intensity
one-twentieth
or
more
of
the
strength
of
station
B's
signal
at
that
point
.
4
.
The
20-to-1
ratio
for
cochannel
interference
embodies
one
of
the
fundamental
limiting
principles
which
we
must
always
take
into
account
in
AM
assignments
and
allocations
--
that
signals
from
a
particular
station
are
potential
sources
of
objectionable
interference
over
an
area
much
greater
than
that
within
which
they
provide
useful
service
.
A
second
fundamental
principle
is
that
involved
particularly
in
the
present
proceeding
--
the
difference
between
nighttime
and
daytime
propagation
conditions
with
respect
to
the
standard
broadcast
frequencies
.
This
is
a
phenomenon
familiar
to
all
radio
listeners
,
resulting
from
reflection
of
skywave
signals
at
night
from
the
ionized
layer
in
the
upper
atmosphere
known
as
the
ionosphere
.
All
AM
stations
radiate
both
skywave
and
groundwave
signals
,
at
all
hours
;
;
but
during
the
middle
daytime
hours
these
skywave
radiations
are
not
reflected
in
any
substantial
quantity
,
and
during
this
portion
of
the
day
both
skywave
service
and
skywave
interference
are
,
in
general
,
negligible
.
But
during
nighttime
hours
the
skywave
radiations
are
reflected
from
the
ionosphere
,
thereby
creating
the
possibility
of
one
station's
rendering
service
,
via
skywave
,
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
it
can
through
its
groundwave
signal
,
and
at
the
same
time
vastly
complicating
the
interference
problem
because
of
the
still
greater
distance
over
which
these
skywave
signals
may
cause
interference
to
the
signals
of
stations
on
the
same
and
closely
adjacent
frequencies
.
Because
of
the
difference
between
daytime
and
nighttime
propagation
conditions
,
it
has
been
necessary
to
evolve
different
allocation
structures
for
daytime
and
nighttime
broadcasting
in
the
AM
band
,
with
many
more
stations
operating
during
the
day
than
at
night
.
5
.
It
was
recognized
years
ago
that
the
transition
from
daytime
to
nighttime
propagation
conditions
,
and
vice
versa
,
is
not
an
instantaneous
process
,
but
takes
place
over
periods
of
time
from
roughly
2
hours
before
sunset
until
about
2
hours
after
sunset
,
and
again
from
roughly
2
hours
before
sunrise
until
some
2
hours
after
sunrise
.
During
the
period
of
about
4
hours
around
sunset
,
skywave
transmission
conditions
are
building
up
until
full
nighttime
conditions
prevail
;
;
during
the
same
period
around
sunrise
,
skywave
transmission
is
declining
,
until
at
about
2
hours
after
sunrise
it
reaches
a
point
where
it
becomes
of
little
practical
significance
.
However
,
in
this
case
as
elsewhere
it
was
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
single
standard
to
be
applied
to
all
situations
,
representing
an
averaging
of
conditions
,
and
thus
to
fix
particular
points
in
time
which
would
be
considered
the
dividing
points
between
daytime
and
nighttime
conditions
.
It
was
determined
that
the
hours
of
sunrise
and
sunset
,
respectively
,
should
be
used
for
this
purpose
.
Accordingly
,
the
1938-39
rules
adopted
these
hours
as
limitations
upon
the
operation
of
daytime
stations
.
Class
2
,
stations
operating
on
clear
channels
are
required
to
cease
operation
or
operate
under
nighttime
restrictions
beginning
either
at
local
sunset
(
for
daytime
class
2
,
stations
)
or
sunset
at
the
location
of
the
dominant
class
1
,
station
where
located
west
of
the
class
2
,
station
(
for
limited-time
class
2
,
stations
)
.
The
same
restrictions
apply
after
local
sunset
in
the
case
of
class
3
,
stations
operating
on
regional
channels
,
which
after
that
time
are
required
to
operate
under
nighttime
restrictions
in
order
to
protect
each
other
.
With
respect
to
nighttime
assignments
,
the
degree
of
skywave
service
and
interference
is
determined
by
skywave
curves
(
figs.
1
and
2
of
sec.
3.190
of
the
rules
)
giving
average
skywave
values
.
These
curves
were
derived
by
an
analysis
of
extensive
skywave
measurement
data
.
It
was
recognized
that
skywave
signals
,
because
of
their
reflected
nature
,
are
of
great
variability
and
subject
to
wide
fluctuations
in
strength
.
For
this
reason
,
the
more
uncertain
skywave
service
was
denominated
``
secondary
''
in
our
rules
,
as
compared
to
the
steadier
,
more
reliable
groundwave
``
primary
service
''
,
and
,
for
both
skywave
service
and
skywave
interference
,
signal
strength
is
expressed
in
terms
of
percentage
of
time
a
particular
signal-intensity
level
is
exceeded
--
50
percent
of
the
time
for
skywave
service
,
10
percent
of
the
time
for
skywave
interference
.
Allocation
policies
6
.
As
mentioned
,
the
allocation
of
AM
stations
represents
a
balance
between
protection
against
interference
and
the
provision
of
opportunity
for
an
adequate
number
of
stations
.
The
rules
and
policies
to
be
applied
in
this
process
of
course
must
be
based
on
objectives
which
represent
what
is
to
be
desired
if
radio
service
is
to
be
of
maximum
use
to
the
Nation
.
Our
objectives
,
as
we
have
stated
many
times
,
are
--
(
1
)
To
provide
some
service
to
all
listeners
;
;
(
2
)
To
provide
as
many
choices
of
service
to
as
many
listeners
as
possible
;
;
(
3
)
To
provide
service
of
local
origin
to
as
many
listeners
as
possible
.
Since
broadcast
frequencies
are
very
limited
in
number
,
these
objectives
are
to
some
extent
inconsistent
in
that
not
all
of
them
can
be
fully
realized
,
and
to
the
extent
that
each
is
realized
,
there
is
a
corresponding
reduction
of
the
possibilities
for
fullest
achievement
of
the
others
.
Accordingly
,
the
Commission
has
recognized
that
an
optimum
allocation
pattern
for
one
frequency
does
not
necessarily
represent
the
best
pattern
for
other
frequencies
,
and
has
assigned
different
frequencies
for
use
by
different
classes
of
stations
.
Some
45
frequencies
are
assigned
for
use
primarily
by
dominant
Class
1
,
--
A
or
Class
1
,
--
B
clear-channel
stations
,
designed
to
operate
with
adequate
power
and
to
provide
service
--
both
groundwave
and
(
at
night
)
skywave
--
over
large
areas
and
at
great
distances
,
being
protected
against
interference
to
the
degree
necessary
to
achieve
this
objective
.
In
dealing
with
these
frequencies
,
the
objective
listed
first
above
--
provision
of
service
to
all
listeners
--
was
predominant
;
;
the
other
objectives
were
subordinated
to
it
.
The
class
1
,
stations
on
these
clear
channels
are
protected
to
their
0.1-mv./m.
groundwave
contours
against
daytime
cochannel
interference
.
With
respect
to
skywave
service
rendered
at
night
,
class
1
,
--
A
stations
are
the
only
stations
permitted
to
operate
in
the
United
States
on
clear
channels
specified
for
class
1
,
--
A
operation
,
and
so
render
skywave
service
free
from
cochannel
interference
whereever
they
may
be
received
;
;
class
1
,
--
B
stations
are
protected
at
night
to
their
0.5-mv./m.
50-percent
time
skywave
contours
against
cochannel
interference
.
Since
the
provision
of
skywave
service
requires
adequate
freedom
from
interference
,
only
class
1
,
stations
are
capable
of
rendering
skywave
service
.
But
nighttime
operation
by
stations
of
other
classes
of
course
entails
skywave
interference
to
groundwave
service
,
interference
which
is
substantial
unless
steps
are
taken
to
minimize
it
.
7
.
With
respect
to
other
frequencies
,
these
are
designated
as
regional
or
local
,
and
assigned
for
use
by
class
3
,
and
class
4
,
stations
,
respectively
,
stations
operating
generally
with
lower
power
.
In
the
allocation
pattern
worked
out
for
these
frequencies
,
the
provision
of
long-range
service
has
to
some
extent
been
subordinated
to
the
other
two
objectives
--
assignment
of
multiple
facilities
,
and
assignment
of
stations
in
as
many
communities
as
possible
.
8
.
As
mentioned
,
the
primary
allocation
objective
to
be
followed
in
the
allocation
of
stations
on
clear
channels
is
the
provision
of
widespread
service
,
free
from
destructive
interference
.
During
nighttime
hours
,
because
of
the
intense
skywave
propagation
then
prevailing
,
no
large
number
of
stations
can
be
permitted
to
operate
on
one
of
these
channels
,
if
the
wide
area
service
for
which
these
frequencies
are
assigned
is
to
be
rendered
satisfactorily
by
the
dominant
stations
which
must
be
relied
upon
to
render
it
.
Therefore
,
under
our
longstanding
allocation
rules
,
on
some
of
these
channels
no
station
other
than
the
dominant
(
class
1
)
--
A
)
station
is
permitted
to
operate
at
night
,
so
that
the
1
,
--
A
station
can
render
service
,
interference
free
,
wherever
it
can
be
received
.
On
the
remainder
of
the
clear
channels
,
the
dominant
(
class
1
)
--
B
stations
are
protected
as
described
above
,
and
the
relatively
small
number
of
secondary
(
class
2
)
)
stations
permitted
to
operate
on
these
channels
at
night
are
required
to
operate
directionally
and/or
with
reduced
power
so
as
to
protect
the
class
1
,
stations
.
In
the
daytime
,
on
the
other
hand
,
since
skywave
transmission
is
relatively
inefficient
,
it
is
possible
to
assign
a
substantially
larger
number
of
stations
on
these
channels
.
Additional
class
2
,
assignments
for
daytime
operation
can
be
made
without
causing
destructive
interference
to
the
class
1
,
stations
or
to
each
other
,
and
by
their
operation
provide
additional
service
on
these
channels
and
additional
local
outlets
for
a
large
number
of
communities
.
Such
additional
daytime
class
2
,
assignments
are
appropriate
if
optimum
use
is
to
be
made
of
these
frequencies
,
and
the
Commission
has
over
the
years
made
a
large
number
of
them
.
Similarly
,
on
the
regional
channels
many
class
3
,
stations
have
been
assigned
either
to
operate
daytime
only
or
to
operate
nighttime
with
directional
antennas
and/or
lower
power
.
9
.
Essentially
,
the
question
presented
for
decision
in
the
present
Daytime
Skywave
proceeding
is
whether
our
decision
(
in
1938-1939
)
to
assign
stations
on
the
basis
of
daytime
conditions
from
sunrise
to
sunset
,
is
sound
as
a
basis
for
AM
allocations
,
or
whether
,
in
the
light
of
later
developments
and
new
understanding
,
skywave
transmission
is
of
such
significance
during
the
hours
immediately
before
sunset
and
after
sunrise
that
this
condition
should
be
taken
into
account
,
and
some
stations
required
to
afford
protection
to
other
stations
during
these
hours
.
The
history
of
the
proceeding
10
.
The
decision
reached
in
1938-39
was
made
after
the
accumulation
of
a
large
amount
of
data
and
thorough
study
thereof
.
Since
then
,
there
has
been
a
notable
increase
in
the
number
of
stations
and
also
the
accumulation
of
additional
data
and
the
development
of
new
techniques
for
using
it
,
leading
to
a
better
understanding
of
propagation
phenomena
.
In
1947
,
affidavits
were
filed
with
the
Commission
by
various
clear-channel
stations
alleging
that
extensive
interference
was
being
caused
to
the
service
areas
of
these
stations
during
daylight
hours
,
from
class
2
,
stations
whose
signals
were
being
reflected
from
the
ionosphere
so
as
to
create
skywave
intereference
.
If

,
and

you
may
do
so

Minors
minors
must
also
file
returns
if
they
earn
$600
or
more
during
the
year
.
A
minor
is
subject
to
tax
on
his
own
earnings
even
though
his
parent
may
,
under
local
law
,
have
the
right
to
them
and
might
actually
have
received
the
money
.
His
income
is
not
required
to
be
included
in
the
return
of
his
parent
.
A
minor
child
is
allowed
A
personal
exemption
of
$600
on
his
own
return
regardless
of
how
much
money
he
may
earn
.
Exemption
also
allowed
parent
.
If
your
child
is
under
19
or
is
a
student
you
may
also
claim
an
exemption
for
him
if
he
qualifies
as
your
dependent
,
even
though
he
earns
$600
or
more
.
See
Chapter
5
.
Example
.
Your
16
year
old
son
earned
$720
in
1961
.
You
spent
$800
for
his
support
.
Since
he
had
gross
income
of
$600
or
more
,
he
must
file
a
return
in
which
he
may
claim
an
exemption
deduction
of
$600
.
Since
you
contributed
more
than
half
of
his
support
,
you
may
also
claim
an
exemption
for
him
on
your
return
.
He
may
get
a
tax
refund
.
A
minor
who
has
gross
income
of
less
than
$600
is
entitled
to
a
refund
if
income
tax
was
withheld
from
his
wages
.
Generally
,
the
refund
may
be
obtained
by
filing
Form
1040A
accompanied
by
the
withholding
statement
(
Form
W-2
)
.
If
he
had
income
other
than
wages
subject
to
withholding
,
he
may
be

See
Chapter

may
deduct
reasonable
wages
you
paid
to
him
for
services
he
rendered
in
your
business
.
You
may
deduct
these
payments
even
though
your
child
uses
the
money
to
purchase
his
own
clothing
or
other
necessities
which
you
are
normally
obligated
to
furnish
him
,
and
even
though
you
may
be
entitled
to
his
services
.
The
one-
or
two-season
hunt
,
of
which
there
have
been
too
many
recently
,
may
do
more
harm
than
good
;
;
for
such
programs
raise
hopes
of
assistance
toward
achieving
excellence
in
scholarship
and
the
arts
which
are
dashed
when
the
programs
are
discontinued
;
;
and
they
are
dashed
,
no
less
,
by
lack
of
skill
in
making
selections
of
men
and
women
for
development
toward
the
highest
reaches
of
the
mind
and
spirit
.
For
the
making
of
selections
on
the
basis
of
excellence
requires
that
any
foundation
making
the
selections
shall
have
available
the
judgments
of
a
corps
of
advisors
whose
judgments
are
known
to
be
good
:
such
judgments
can
be
known
to
be
good
only
by
the
records
of
those
selected
,
by
records
made
subsequent
to
their
selection
over
considerable
periods
of
time
.
The
central
group
of
the
Foundation's
advisors
are
,
at
any
one
period
of
time
,
the
members
of
our
Advisory
Board
,
consisting
,
now
,
of
thirty-six
men
and
women
.
They
are
chosen
by
the
Foundation's
Board
of
Trustees
on
the
bases
of
their
own
first-rate
accomplishments
in
their
different
fields
of
scholarship
and
the
arts
.
Their
locations
in
all
parts
of
the
United
States
,
and
their
locations
in
the
several
kinds
of
educational
and
research
institutions
that
are
the
principal
homes
of
our
intellectual
and
artistic
strengths
also
are
factors
in
the
Trustees'
minds
.
For
this
concept
of
an
Advisory
Board
,
ancillary
to
the
Board
of
Trustees
,
we
are
indebted
to
the
late
President
of
Harvard
University
,
A.
Lawrence
Lowell
,
a
master
of
the
subject
of
the
structure
of
cultural
institutions
and
their
administration
.
That
we
had
the
wit
and
wisdom
to
adopt
Mr.
Lowell's
concept
and
make
it
the
base
for
our
processes
of
selection
is
one
reason
why
our
selections
have
been
,
it
may
be
said
truly
,
pretty
uniformly
good
.
For
,
in
accordance
with
Mr.
Lowell's
concept
of
an
advisory
board
,
our
selections
are
made
by
experienced
selectors
who
give
both
constancy
and
consistency
to
our
processes
and
our
choices
.
And
lest
we
should
become
too
consistent
,
in
the
sense
of
becoming
heedless
of
new
fields
of
scholarship
and
new
points
of
view
in
the
arts
,
the
Foundation's
Board
of
Trustees
maintains
a
trickle
--
not
a
flow
!
!
--
of
new
members
through
the
Advisory
Board
.
Two
committees
of
members
of
the
Advisory
Board
constitute
the
committees
of
selection
--
one
for
the
selection
of
Fellows
from
Canada
,
the
United
States
,
and
the
English-speaking
Caribbean
area
and
one
for
the
selection
of
Fellows
from
the
Latin
American
republics
and
the
Republic
of
the
Philippines
.
To
the
members
of
our
Advisory
Board
,
and
most
specially
to
its
members
who
constitute
our
committees
of
selection
,
the
Foundation
is
indebted
for
its
successes
of
choice
of
Fellows
.
We
are
,
as
we
know
,
utterly
dependent
on
the
quality
of
advice
we
get
;
;
and
quality
of
advice
,
added
to
devotion
to
the
Foundation's
purposes
and
ideals
,
we
do
get
from
our
Advisory
Board
in
measures
so
full
that
they
can
be
appreciated
only
by
those
of
us
who
work
here
every
day
.
But
the
facts
about
our
Advisory
Board
and
its
members'
duties
are
only
one
of
several
sets
of
facts
about
the
quest
for
advice
,
both
reliable
and
imaginative
,
on
which
to
base
our
selections
of
Fellows
.
For
example
,
the
interest
of
past
members
of
the
Foundation's
Advisory
Board
remains
such
that
they
place
their
knowledge
and
judgments
at
our
disposal
much
as
they
had
done
when
they
were
,
formally
,
members
of
that
Board
.
And
,
besides
,
there
are
a
large
number
of
scholars
,
artists
,
composers
of
music
,
novelists
,
poets
,
essayists
,
choreographers
,
lawyers
,
servants
of
government
,
and
men
of
affairs
--
hundreds
,
indeed
--
who
serve
the
Foundation
well
with
the
advice
they
give
us
freely
and
gratis
out
of
their
experience
.
To
all
,
the
Foundation
gives
the
kind
of
thanks
which
are
more
than
thanks
:
to
them
we
are
grateful
beyond
the
possibility
of
conveying
in
words
how
grateful
we
are
.
It
is
a
truism
of
business
that
no
business
can
be
better
than
its
board
of
directors
and
its
top
management
.
The
same
is
true
of
every
foundation
.
During
the
biennium
reviewed
in
this
Report
,
our
Board
of
Trustees
named
able
men
,
younger
than
the
rest
of
us
,
to
the
Board
and
to
top
management
to
insure
future
continuance
of
the
first-class
administration
of
the
Foundation's
affairs
:
Dr.
James
Brown
Fisk
,
physicist
,
President
of
the
Bell
Telephone
Laboratories
,
was
elected
to
the
Board
of
Trustees
.
He
is
a
member
both
of
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
and
of
the
American
Philosophical
Society
;
;
and
he
has
served
our
country
well
as
a
scientific
statesman
on
international
commissions
.
Dr.
Gordon
N.
Ray
,
Provost
,
Vice-President
and
Professor
of
English
in
the
University
of
Illinois
,
was
appointed
Associate
Secretary
General
.
The
Trustees
of
the
Foundation
appointed
Dr.
Ray
to
that
position
with
the
stated
expectation
that
he
would
succeed
the
present
Secretary
General
upon
the
latter's
eventual
retirement
.
Dr.
Ray
is
a
Fellow
of
the
Foundation
--
appointed
thrice
to
assist
his
studies
of
William
Makepeace
Thackeray
and
of
H.
G.
Wells
--
and
,
before
his
appointment
to
the
Foundation's
executive
staff
,
had
been
given
our
highest
scholarly
accolade
,
appointment
to
the
Advisory
Board
.
Referring
further
to
the
Foundation's
officers
,
Dr.
James
F.
Mathias
,
for
eleven
years
our
discerning
colleague
as
Associate
Secretary
,
was
promoted
to
be
Secretary

He
is
a
historian
,
with
the
great

of
a
historian's
long
view
.

as
Assistant
Secretary

the
great
virtues
that
they
are
trained
to
read
``
the
fine
print
''
carefully
and
are
able
out
of
professional
experience
to
arrive
at
imaginative
solutions
to
difficult
problems
in
many
fields
--
are
indispensable
even
in
a
foundation
office
.
The
present
Secretary
General
has
been
the
Foundation's
principal
administrative
officer
continuously
since
the
Foundation's
establishment
thirty-five
years
ago
.
But
even
he
will
not
last
indefinitely
and
the
above-noted
new
arrangements
are
,
quite
simply
,
made
to
assure
qualitative
continuity
in
the
Foundation's
policies
and
practices
.
The
effective
recognition
of
excellence
and
its
nurture
has
to
be
learned
and
is
not
learned
in
a
day
,
nor
even
in
a
year
.
We
are
not
given
to
lamentations
,
neither
personally
nor
in
these
Reports
.
On
the
contrary
,
if
this
be
an
apocalyptic
era
as
is
commonly
said
,
we
see
it
as
an
era
of
opportunity
.
For
,
granting
that
there
are
great
present-day
problems
to
be
solved
,
these
problems
make
great
demands
;
;
and
by
their
demanding
tend
to
create
resources
of
men's
minds
and
hearts
which
problems
with
easy
answers
do
not
bring
forth
.
Of
this
,
examples
are
legion
:
Pericles
speaking
his
funeral
oration
in
Ancient
Greece's
extremity
after
Thermopylae
and
making
it
a
testament
of
freedom
;
;
Jefferson
writing
the
Declaration
of
Independence
amid
the
catastrophes
of
revolution
;
;
Christ
preaching
the
Sermon
on
the
Mount
,
close
to
his
ultimate
sacrifice
;
;
Shakespeare
speaking
with
``
the
indescribable
gusto
of
the
Elizabethan
voice
''
--
;
;
Keats's
words
--
in
the
days
of
the
Spanish
Armada's
threats
;
;
Isaac
Newton
,
at
the
age
of
twenty-three
,
industriously
calculating
logarithms
``
to
two
and
fifty
places
''
during
the
great
plague
year
in
England
,
1665
;
;
Winston
Churchill's
Olympian
,
optimistic
and
resolute
sayings
when
Britain
stood
alone
against
the
armed
forces
of
tyranny
less
than
twenty
years
ago
;
;
the
present-day
explorations
of
outer
space
,
answering
age-old
questions
of
science
and
philosophy
,
in
the
face
of
possible
wars
of
extinction
.
Forsan
et
haec
olim
meminisse
iuvabit
,
as
the
Roman
poet
,
Virgil
,
declared
with
much
more
historical
sense
than
most
writers
of
today
.
It
gives
,
indeed
,
cause
for
rejoicing
to
remember
what
many
catastrophes
of
the
past
produced
;
;
and
it
is
to
be
noted
also
that
confidence
should
grow
from
remembering
that
great
men
often
appeared
in
the
past
to
turn
local
catastrophe
into
future
good
for
all
mankind
.
For
example
,
out
of
the
social
evils
of
the
English
industrial
revolution
came
the
novels
of
Charles
Dickens
;
;
and
his
genius
moved
his
readers
to
seek
solutions
of
those
evils
for
all
Western
men
--
until
today
--
,
in
the
industrialized
West
,
these
social
evils
substantially
do
not
exist
.
The
solutions
were
not
arrived
at
by
any
theoreticians
of
the
Karl
Marx
stripe
but
by
men
of
government
--
lawyers
,
most
of
them
--
and
men
of
business
.
These
were
educated
men
,
who
,
as
Mr.
Justice
Holmes
was
fond
of
saying
,
formed
their
inductions
out
of
experience
under
the
burden
of
responsibility
.
That
is
,
to
put
it
realistically
,
they
had
to
run
their
businesses
at
a
profit
,
or
they
had
to
get
the
votes
to
get
elected
.
Nevertheless
,
they
made
naught
of
Marx's
prophecy
that
capitalism
would
never
pay
the
``
workers
''
--
to
use
Marx's
word
--
more
than
a
subsistence
wage
,
with
the
consequence
that
increased
productivity
must
inevitably
find
its
way
into
the
capitalists'
pockets
with
the
result
,
in
turn
,
that
the
gap
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
would
irrevocably
widen
and
the
misery
of
the
poor
increase
.
But
as
all
understand
who
have
eyes
to
see
,
nothing
of
the
kind
has
happened
;
;
indeed
,
the
contrary
has
happened
.
The
gulf
between
the
``
rich
''
and
the
``
poor
''
has
narrowed
,
in
the
industrialized
Western
world
,
to
the
point
that
the
word
``
poor
''
is
hardly
applicable
.
And
the
reason
this
could
happen
is
clear
:
men
of
government
,
business
men
,
lawyers
and
all
who
concerned
themselves
with
the
welfare
of
their
fellow
men
did
not
let
their
concern
to
run
their
businesses
at
a
profit
restrict
the
development
of
freedom
and
opportunity
.
Some
would
say
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
run
their
businesses
only
for
profit
;
;
and
even
putting
it
that
way
would
not
prove
that
Marx
was
anything
but
wrong
.
Sir
Henry
Sumner
Maine
,
a
hundred
years
before
Communism
was
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
,
wrote
his
brilliant
legal
generalization
,
that
``
the
progress
of
society
is
from
status
to
contract
''
.
The
essence
of
contract
is
that
one
is
free
to
make
a
choice
of
what
one
will
or
will
not
do
.
Hence
,
the
condition
of
freedom
is
a
necessary
condition
for
choice
.
The
greater
the
range
of
freedom
for
individual
men
,
the
greater
the
range
of
choice
;
;
the
greater
the
range
of
choice
,
the
greater
the
rate
of
change
.
For
change
is
dependent
on
the
possibilities
that
individual
men
glimpse
for
the
future
.
But
when
there
is
not
freedom
and
opportunity
to
choose
,
men
--
individual
men
--
must
remain
in
status
and
society
does
not
,
cannot
,
progress
.
The
eternal
truth
is
that
progress
--
due
,
as
it
always
is
,
to
individual
creative
genius
--
is
just
as
dependent
on
freedom
as
human
life
is
dependent
on
the
beating
of
the
heart
.
And
lest
anybody
think
that
considerations
such
as
these
are
not
germane
in
a
foundation
report
,
let
me
enlighten
them
with
the
truths
that
,
under
Communism
there
would
have
been
no
capital
with
which
to
endow
the
Foundation
,
and
that
there
would
not
be
that
individual
freedom
within
which
the
Fellows
might
proceed
,
untrammeled
in
every
way
,
toward
their
discoveries
,
their
creative
efforts
for
the
good
of
mankind
.
During
the
year
1959
,
we
granted
354
Fellowships
;
;
in
1960
,
we
granted
334
.
As
heretofore
,
our
Fellowships
are
available
to
assist
research
in
all
fields
of
knowledge
and
creative
effort
in
all
the
arts
.
We
do
not
favor
one
field
over
another
:
we
think
that
all
inquiry
,
all
scholarly
and
artistic
creation
,
is
good
--
provided
only
that
it
contributes
to
a
sense
and
understanding
of
the
true
ends
of
life
,
as
all
first-rate
scholarship
and
artistic
creation
does
.
Indeed
,
if
pressed
,
we
would
say
what
the
late
Robert
Henri
,
American
painter
,
said
to
a
pupil
,
``
Anything
will
do
for
a
subject
:
it's
what
you
do
with
it
that
counts
''
.
Thus
,
we
have
no
part
,
and
want
none
,
in
current
discussions
of
the
relative
importance
of
science
,
the
social
studies
,
the
humanities
,
the
creative
arts
.
We
want
no
part
in
such
discussions
,
because
we
think
them
largely
futile
;
;
and
we
think
them
largely
futile
because
,
for
true
excellence
of
accomplishment
,
every
scholar
and
every
artist
must
cross
boundaries
of
knowledge
and
boundaries
of
points
of
view
.
When
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Manufacturing
Company
reached
its
125th
year
as
a
going
industrial
concern
during
1958
,
it
became
an
almost
unique
institution
in
the
mechanical
world
.
With
its
history
standing
astride
all
but
the
very
beginnings
of
the
industrial
revolution
,
Brown
&
Sharpe
has
become
over
the
years
a
singular
monument
to
the
mechanical
foresight
of
its
founder
,
Joseph
R.
Brown
,
and
a
world-renowned
synonym
for
precision
and
progress
in
metalworking
technology
.
Joseph
R.
Brown
grew
up
in
the
bustle
and
enterprise
of
New
England
between
1810
and
1830
.
He
was
early
exposed
to
the
mechanical
world
,
and
in
his
youth
often
helped
his
father
,
David
Brown
,
master
clock
and
watchmaker
,
as
he
plied
his
trade
.
At
the
age
of
17
he
became
an
apprentice
machinist
at
the
shop
of
Walcott
&
Harris
in
Valley
Falls
,
Rhode
Island
,
and
following
two
or
three
other
jobs
in
quick
succession
after
graduation
,
he
went
into
business
for
himself
in
1831
,
making
lathes
and
small
tools
.
This
enterprise
led
to
a
father-and-son
combination
beginning
in
1833
,
under
the
name
D.
Brown
&
Son
,
a
business
which
eventually
grew
into
the
modern
corporation
we
now
call
Brown
&
Sharpe
.
The
years
of
Joseph's
partnership
with
his
father
were
numbered
.
In
1838
,
a
devastating
fire
gutted
their
small
shop
and
soon
thereafter
David
Brown
moved
west
to
Illinois
,
settling
on
a
land
grant
in
his
declining
years
.
Joseph
Brown
continued
in
business
by
himself
,
quickly
rebuilding
the
establishment
which
had
been
lost
in
the
fire
and
beginning
those
first
steps
which
were
to
establish
him
as
a
pioneer
in
raising
the
standards
of
accuracy
of
machine
shop
practice
throughout
the
world
.
Much
of
his
genius
,
of
course
,
sprang
from
his
familiarity
with
clock
movements
.
During
these
early
years
the
repair
of
watches
and
clocks
and
the
building
of
special
clocks
for
church
steeples
formed
an
important
part
of
the
young
man's
occupation
.
He
became
particularly
interested
in
graduating
and
precision
measurement
during
the
1840's
,
and
his
thinking
along
these
lines
developed
considerably
during
this
period
.
But
his
business
also
grew
,
and
we
are
told
that
Mr.
Brown
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
devote
as
much
time
to
his
creative
thinking
as
his
inclinations
led
him
to
desire
.
It
must
have
been
with
some
pleasure
and
relief
that
on
September
12
,
1848
,
Joseph
Brown
made
the
momentous
entry
in
his
job
book
,
in
his
characteristically
cryptic
style
,
``
Lucian
Sharpe
came
to
work
for
me
this
day
as
an
apprentice
''
.
The
young
apprentice
apparently
did
well
by
Mr.
Brown
,
for
in
the
third
year
of
his
apprenticeship
Lucian
was
offered
a
full
partnership
in
the
firm
;
;
the
company
became
``
J.
R.
Brown
&
Sharpe
''
,
and
entered
into
a
new
and
important
period
of
its
development
.
Mr.
Sharpe's
arrival
in
the
business
did
indeed
provide
what
Mr.
Brown
had
most
coveted
--
time
for
``
tinkering
''
,
and
the
opportunity
of
carrying
out
in
the
back
room
those
developments
in
precision
graduation
which
most
interested
him
at
that
time
.
By
1853
,
the
new
partnership
announced
the
precision
vernier
caliper
as
the
first
fruit
of
their
joint
efforts
.
The
basic
significance
of
this
invention
helped
them
to
follow
it
rapidly
in
1855
by
the
development
of
a
unique
precision
gear
cutting
and
dividing
engine
.
That
development
,
in
turn
,
formed
the
foundation
of
still
more
significant
expansions
in
later
years
--
in
gear
cutting
,
in
circular
graduating
,
in
index
drilling
,
and
in
many
other
fields
where
accuracy
was
a
paramount
requirement
.
Throughout
their
careers
,
both
Mr.
Brown
and
Mr.
Sharpe
were
interested
in
the
problem
of
setting
up
standards
of
measurement
for
the
mechanical
trades
.
Several
efforts
were
made
in
this
direction
,
and
though
not
all
of
them
survive
to
this
day
,
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
wire
gage
system
was
eventually
adopted
as
the
American
standard
and
is
still
in
common
use
today
.
As
one
development
followed
another
,
the
company's
reputation
for
precision
in
the
graduating
field
brought
it
broader
and
broader
opportunities
for
expansion
in
precision
manufacture
.
In
1858
,
the
partnership
began
manufacturing
the
Willcox
&
Gibbs
sewing
machine
.
As
the
story
goes
,
Mr.
Gibbs
,
who
originally
came
from
the
back
counties
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Virginia
,
saw
an
illustration
in
a
magazine
of
the
famous
Howe
sewing
machine
.
Curious
as
to
what
made
it
work
,
he
built
a
crude
model
of
it
in
wood
,
and
filed
a
piece
of
steel
until
he
succeeded
in
making
a
metal
pickup
for
the
thread
,
enabling
the
crude
machine
to
take
stitches
.
When
he
showed
this
model
as
his
``
solution
''
as
to
how
the
Howe
sewing
machine
operated
,
he
was
told
he
was
``
wrong
''
,
and
discovered
to
his
amazement
that
the
Howe
Machine
,
which
was
unknown
to
him
in
detail
,
used
two
threads
while
the
one
that
he
had
perfected
used
only
one
.
Thus
was
invented
the
single
thread
sewing
machine
,
which
Mr.
Gibbs
in
partnership
with
Mr.
Willcox
decided
to
bring
to
Brown
&
Sharpe
with
the
proposal
that
the
small
company
undertake
its
manufacture
.
The
new
work
was
a
boon
to
the
partnership
,
not
only
for
its
own
value
but
particularly
for
the
stimulation
it
provided
to
the
imagination
of
J.
R.
Brown
toward
yet
further
developments
for
production
equipment
.
The
turret
screw
machine
,
now
known
as
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
hand
screw
machine
,
takes
its
ancestry
directly
from
Mr.
Brown's
efforts
to
introduce
equipment
to
simplify
the
manufacture
of
the
sewing
machine
.
Mr.
Brown
made
important
additions
to
the
arts
in
screw
machine
design
by
drastically
improving
the
means
for
revolving
the
turret
,
by
introducing
automatic
feeding
devices
for
the
stock
,
and
reversible
tap
and
die
holders
.
In
1861
,
Mr.
Brown's
attention
was
called
to
yet
another
basic
production
problem
--
the
manufacture
of
twist
drills
.
At
that
time
,
during
the
Civil
War
,
Union
muskets
were
being
manufactured
in
Providence
and
the
drills
to
drill
them
were
being
hand-filed
with
rattail
files
.
This
process
neither
satisfied
the
urgent
production
schedules
nor
Mr.
Brown's
imagination
of
the
possibilities
in
the
situation
.
The
child
of
this
problem
was
Mr.
Brown's
famous
Serial
No.
1
Universal
Milling
Machine
,
the
archtype
from
which
is
descended
today's
universal
knee-type
milling
machine
used
throughout
the
world
.
The
original
machine
,
bearing
its
famous
serial
number
,
is
still
on
exhibition
at
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Precision
Center
in
Providence
.
During
the
Civil
War
period
Mr.
Brown
also
invented
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
formed
tooth
gear
cutter
,
a
basic
invention
which
ultimately
revolutionized
the
world's
gear
manufacturing
industry
by
changing
its
basic
economics
.
Up
until
that
time
it
had
been
possible
to
make
cutters
for
making
gear
teeth
,
but
they
were
good
for
only
one
sharpening
.
As
soon
as
the
time
came
for
re-sharpening
,
the
precise
form
of
the
gear
tooth
was
lost
and
a
new
cutter
had
to
be
made
.
This
process
made
the
economical
manufacture
of
gears
questionable
until
some
way
could
be
found
to
permit
the
repeated
re-sharpening
of
gear
tooth
cutters
without
the
loss
of
the
precision
form
.
Mr.
Brown's
invention
achieved
this
and
,
as
a
byproduct
,
formed
the
cornerstone
of
Brown
&
Sharpe's
position
of
leadership
in
the
gear
making
equipment
field
which
lasted
until
the
1920's
when
superceded
by
other
methods
.
The
micrometer
caliper
,
as
a
common
workshop
tool
,
also
owes
much
to
J.
R.
Brown
.
Although
Mr.
Brown
was
not
himself
its
inventor
(
it
was
a
French
idea
)
,
it
is
typical
that
his
intuition
first
conceived
the
importance
of
mass
producing
this
basic
tool
for
general
use
.
So
it
was
that
when
Mr.
Brown
and
Mr.
Sharpe
first
saw
the
French
tool
on
exhibition
in
Paris
in
1868
,
they
brought
a
sample
with
them
to
the
United
States
and
started
Brown
&
Sharpe
in
yet
another
field
where
it
retains
its
leadership
to
this
day
.
The
final
achievement
of
Mr.
Brown's
long
and
interesting
mechanical
career
runs
a
close
second
in
importance
to
his
development
of
the
universal
milling
machine
.
That
achievement
was
his
creation
of
the
universal
grinding
machine
,
which
made
its
appearance
in
1876
at
the
Philadelphia
Centennial
Exposition
.
This
machine
,
like
its
milling
counterpart
,
was
the
antecedent
of
a
machine-family
used
to
this
very
day
in
precision
metalworking
shops
throughout
the
world
.
Along
with
J.
R.
Brown's
other
major
developments
,
the
universal
grinding
machine
was
profoundly
influential
in
setting
the
course
of
Brown
&
Sharpe
for
many
years
to
come
.
Following
Mr.
Brown's
death
,
there
came
forward
in
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
organization
many
other
men
who
contributed
greatly
to
the
development
of
the
company
.
One
such
man
was
Samuel
Darling
.
As
head
of
the
firm
Darling
&
Swartz
,
Mr.
Darling
began
by
challenging
Brown
&
Sharpe
to
its
keenest
competition
during
the
1850's
and
early
60's
.
In
1868
,
however
,
a
truce
was
called
between
the
companies
,
and
the
partnership
of
Darling
,
Brown
&
Sharpe
was
formed
.
Between
that
year
and
the
buying
out
of
Mr.
Darling's
interest
in
1892
,
a
large
portion
of
the
company's
precision
tool
business
was
carried
out
under
the
name
of
Darling
,
Brown
&
Sharpe
,
and
to
this
day
many
old
precision
tools
are
in
use
still
bearing
that
famous
trademark
.
Perhaps
the
outstanding
standard
bearer
of
Mr.
Brown's
tradition
for
accuracy
was
Mr.
Oscar
J.
Beale
,
whose
mechanical
genius
closely
paralleled
that
of
Mr.
Brown
,
and
whose
particular
forte
was
the
development
of
the
exceedingly
accurate
measuring
machinery
that
enabled
Brown
&
Sharpe
to
manufacture
gages
,
and
therefore
its
products
,
with
an
accuracy
exceeding
anything
then
available
elsewhere
in
the
world
.
Also
important
on
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
scene
,
at
the
turn
of
the
century
,
was
Mr.
Richmond
Viall
,
Works
Superintendent
of
the
company
from
1876
to
1910
.
Mr.
Viall
possessed
remarkable
talents
for
the
leadership
and
development
of
men
.
He
was
an
ardent
champion
of
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Apprentice
Program
and
personal
counselor
to
countless
able
men
who
first
developed
their
industrial
talents
with
the
company
.
In
one
sense
it
can
be
said
that
one
of
the
most
important
Brown
&
Sharpe
products
over
the
years
has
been
the
men
who
began
work
with
the
company
and
subsequently
came
to
places
of
industrial
eminence
throughout
the
nation
and
even
abroad
.
Commencing
with
the
death
of
Lucian
Sharpe
in
1899
,
the
name
of
Henry
D.
Sharpe
was
for
more
than
50
years
closely
interwoven
with
the
destiny
of
the
company
.
During
his
presidency
,
the
company's
physical
plant
was
enormously
expanded
,
and
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
machine
tool
line
became
the
greatest
in
the
world
.
During
the
early
part
of
this
century
,
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
works
in
Providence
were
unchallenged
as
the
largest
single
manufacturing
facility
devoted
exclusively
to
precision
machinery
and
tool
manufacture
anywhere
in
the
world
.
During
these
years
the
company's
product
line
followed
the
basic
tenets
laid
down
by
Mr.
Brown
.
It
expanded
from
hand
screw
machines
to
automatic
screw
machines
,
from
simple
formed-tooth
gear
cutting
machines
to
gear
hobbing
machines
and
a
large
contract
gear
manufacturing
business
,
from
rudimentary
belt-driven
universal
milling
machines
to
a
broad
line
of
elaborately
controlled
knee-type
and
manufacturing
type
milling
machines
.
In
the
grinding
machine
field
,
expansion
went
far
from
universal
grinders
alone
and
took
in
cylindrical
grinders
,
surface
grinders
,
and
a
wide
variety
of
special
and
semi-special
models
.
In
1951
,
Henry
D.
Sharpe
,
Jr.
succeeded
his
father
and
continued
the
company's
development
as
a
major
factor
in
the
metal-working
equipment
business
.
The
company
is
still
broadening
its
line
and
is
now
active
on
four
major
fronts
.
The
Machine
Tool
Division
is
currently
producing
Brown
&
Sharpe
single
spindle
automatic
screw
machines
,
grinding
machines
of
many
types
,
and
knee
and
bed-type
milling
machines
.
Recently
added
is
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
turret
drilling
machine
which
introduces
the
company
to
an
entirely
new
field
of
tool
development
.
In
the
Industrial
Products
Division
,
the
company
manufactures
and
markets
a
wide
line
of
precision
gaging
and
inspection
equipment
,
machinists'
tools
--
including
micrometers
,
Vernier
calipers
,
and
accessories
.
In
the
Cutting
Tool
Division
,
the
principal
products
include
a
wide
variety
of
high
speed
steel
milling
cutters
,
end
mills
and
saws
.
Sales
and
net
income
for
the
year
ended
December
31
,
1960
showed
an
improvement
over
1959
.
Net
income
was
$2,557,111
,
or
$3.11
per
share
on
821,220
common
shares
currently
outstanding
,
as
compared
to
$2,323,867
or
$2.82
per
share
in
1959
,
adjusted
to
the
same
number
of
shares
.
Sales
and
other
operating
income
increased
25.1%
from
$24,926,615
in
1959
to
$31,179,816
in
1960
.
This
increase
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
effect
on
net
income
of
higher
costs
of
manufacture
and
increased
expenditures
on
research
and
development
.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
our
largest
market
,
the
textile
industry
,
was
affected
substantially
by
the
current
decline
in
business
activity
,
we
have
been
able
to
produce
and
deliver
our
machines
throughout
the
year
1960
at
a
rate
materially
higher
than
during
1959
.
Outlook
for
current
year
Our
current
rate
of
incoming
orders
has
now
contracted
and
unless
this
trend
can
be
reversed
,
our
production
for
1961
will
be
lower
than
for
1960
.
However
,
the
healthy
inventory
position
of
the
textile
industry
lends
support
to
the
broadly
expressed
belief
that
improvement
in
that
industry
can
be
expected
by
the
second
half
of
1961
.
Need
for
sound
tax
policy
In
connection
with
our
continuing
development
of
new
and
more
efficient
mill
machinery
,
a
sounder
U.
S.
income
tax
policy
on
depreciation
of
production
equipment
,
enabling
the
mills
to
charge
off
the
cost
of
new
machines
on
a
more
realistic
basis
,
could
,
if
adopted
,
have
favorable
effects
on
Leesona's
business
in
the
next
few
years
.
Such
a
depreciation
policy
would
also
,
we
believe
,
prove
a
very
important
factor
in
strengthening
the
competitive
position
of
the
U.
S.
textile
and
other
industries
,
thus
helping
to
strengthen
the
position
of
the
dollar
in
foreign
exchange
.
Research
and
development
Our
research
and
development
program
,
serving
as
it
does
an
industry
which
must
compete
against
low-cost
production
throughout
the
world
,
continues
to
have
primary
emphasis
at
Leesona
.
This
program
is
based
on
the
policy
of
designing
and
building
efficient
machines
which
will
help
produce
better
textile
values
--
fabrics
whose
cost
in
relation
to
quality
,
fashion
and
utility
provide
the
consumer
with
better
textile
products
for
the
money
.
Such
policy
involves
continuing
effort
to
improve
on
existing
mill
equipment
,
in
terms
of
efficiency
and
versatility
.
But
more
important
,
we
believe
,
it
must
concentrate
on
the
development
of
entirely
new
concepts
in
textile
processing
as
do
the
Unifil
loom
winder
and
our
more
recent
Uniconer
automatic
coning
machine
.
Budget
increased
On
this
basis
,
our
already
substantial
budget
for
research
and
development
has
been
further
increased
in
recent
years
in
order
to
finance
the
continuing
engineering
and
design
work
essential
to
Leesona's
future
growth
in
sales
and
earnings
.
Much
of
this
necessary
increase
in
research
and
development
,
though
properly
chargeable
to
current
expenses
,
is
not
reflected
in
earnings
until
projects
are
completed
and
the
new
machines
sold
in
quantity
,
usually
over
a
period
of
several
years
.
Stretch
yarn
machines
In
December
we
began
to
ship
our
ultra-high-speed
stretch
yarn
machines
.
These
machines
produce
the
higher
quality
stretch
yarns
required
in
weaving
stretch
and
textured
fabrics
.
During
the
past
year
,
great
progress
has
been
made
by
the
weaving
mills
in
creating
new
stretch
and
textured
fabrics
.
Fashion
centers
are
now
predicting
broad
acceptance
of
sports
apparel
and
improved
``
wash
and
wear
''
dresses
and
blouses
made
from
these
fabrics
.
This
machine
,
operating
at
speeds
up
to
350,000
revolutions
per
minute
,
is
believed
to
provide
one
of
the
fastest
mechanical
operations
in
industry
today
.
It
transfers
yarn
directly
from
the
producers'
largest
package
into
ideal
supply
packages
for
use
on
Unifil
loom
winders
in
weaving
stretch
yarn
fabrics
.
Large-package
twister
Our
new
large-package
ring
twister
for
glass
fiber
yarns
is
performing
well
in
our
customers'
mills
.
Later
in
the
year
,
additional
types
of
this
Leesona
twister
will
be
made
available
to
mills
for
other
man-made
fibers
and
natural
yarns
.
These
machines
are
designed
to
provide
higher
operating
speeds
,
larger
yarn
packages
,
and
greater
flexibility
of
application
to
different
types
of
yarn
.
This
we
believe
will
substantially
broaden
the
potential
market
for
the
equipment
.
Uniconer
Major
activity
at
Providence
in
1961
will
involve
the
scheduled
completion
of
tooling
for
production
of
the
Uniconer
automatic
coning
machine
.
This
work
is
progressing
on
schedule
and
we
expect
to
make
initial
shipments
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
.
This
machine
was
demonstrated
in
two
textile
machinery
exhibitions
last
year
and
was
well
received
by
the
industry
.
The
potential
market
for
the
machine
should
be
comparable
to
that
of
the
Unifil
loom
winder
.
The
Uniconer
has
several
outstanding
features
--
it
operates
with
much
greater
efficiency
than
existing
equipment
;
;
it
incorporates
an
automatic
knot-tying
device
on
each
spindle
,
and
it
will
knot
a
break
in
the
yarn
in
10
seconds
as
well
as
tie
in
new
bobbins
as
the
running
end
is
exhausted
.
Because
the
bobbin-to-cone
winding
process
is
a
relatively
high-cost
operation
for
the
mill
,
the
almost
complete
automation
provided
by
the
Uniconer
can
mean
important
economies
in
textile
production
,
at
the
same
time
upgrading
quality
.
Many
mills
have
already
placed
firm
orders
for
this
machine
.
New
Unifil
application
A
new
application
for
the
Unifil
loom
winder
,
running
single
filling
for
box
looms
,
will
broaden
mill
use
of
this
equipment
.
Take-up
machines
A
new
spinning
take-up
machine
has
been
developed
to
facilitate
the
use
of
our
take-up
machine
in
the
production
of
thermoplastic
yarns
.
It
is
equipped
with
electronic
controls
that
can
be
set
to
hold
precise
tension
and
speed
.
This
new
machine
takes
up
filament
yarn
from
spinneret
or
extruder
and
winds
large
packages
at
speeds
up
to
6,000
feet
per
minute
.
It
is
equipped
with
an
automatic
threading
device
to
reduce
waste
and
handling
time
.
Our
take-up
machines
and
our
twister-coners
are
undergoing
important
pilot
plant
testing
for
application
with
new
high
polymer
yarns
,
in
several
fiber
producing
plants
.
We
look
forward
to
a
stronger
position
in
this
expanding
field
.
Diversification
plans
We
are
interested
in
further
diversification
into
other
fields
of
capital
goods
,
or
components
for
industrial
products
,
and
have
recently
intensified
our
efforts
in
that
direction
.
Patterson
Moos
research
Our
Patterson
Moos
Research
Division
has
made
further
very
encouraging
progress
in
development
of
fuel
cells
.
The
cooperation
of
our
exclusive
American
licensee
,
Pratt
&
Whitney
Aircraft
Division
of
United
Aircraft
Corporation
,
has
been
important
in
this
work
.
In
addition
to
its
major
effort
on
fuel
cells
,
Patterson
Moos
Research
Division
is
continuing
to
carry
on
research
in
other
fields
,
both
under
contract
for
the
Defense
Department
,
other
government
agencies
and
for
our
own
account
.
PMR
is
currently
supplying
components
vital
to
the
Titan
and
Minuteman
programs
.
We
have
recently
entered
into
an
agreement
with
Compagnie
Generale
De
Telegraphie
Sans
Fil
(
CSF
)
of
France
for
the
exclusive
exchange
of
technical
information
on
thermoelectric
materials
.
The
agreement
gives
us
rights
for
manufacturing
and
marketing
of
such
materials
in
the
United
States
.
Initially
we
will
import
the
thermoelectric
materials
and
modules
from
France
but
later
we
will
manufacture
in
this
country
.
There
is
a
rapidly
growing
demand
for
this
material
,
primarily
from
the
military
.
Further
research
,
we
believe
,
will
develop
important
commercial
applications
.
A
project
for
the
Air
Force
has
been
completed
in
which
the
NAIR
infrared
detecting
device
was
developed
for
area
monitoring
of
noxious
or
dangerous
gases
.
We
are
initiating
research
on
the
use
of
solid
state
materials
for
infrared
detection
using
a
method
which
will
not
require
cooling
of
materials
to
attain
high
sensitivity
.
The
rapid
advance
in
science
today
suggests
many
other
avenues
of
investigation
.
Our
plan
is
to
keep
abreast
of
these
advances
,
and
select
for
development
those
fields
which
seem
most
promising
for
our
special
capabilities
.
New
plant
facilities
Early
in
August
we
broke
ground
for
a
new
$3,500,000
plant
in
Warwick
,
Rhode
Island
,
which
will
house
our
textile
and
coil
winding
machinery
operations
.
Construction
is
well
along
,
and
the
plant
is
scheduled
for
completion
in
November
of
this
year
.
All
operations
now
carried
on
at
our
plant
at
Cranston
will
be
transferred
to
Warwick
.
Operations
in
the
new
plant
should
be
producing
efficiently
early
in
1962
.
An
architect's
sketch
of
the
new
plant
is
shown
on
the
front
cover
.
The
building
will
contain
430,000
square
feet
,
approximately
the
same
as
our
present
plant
.
However
,
its
modern
one-story
layout
is
designed
to
increase
our
production
capacity
,
permit
more
efficient
manufacturing
,
and
substantially
reduce
current
repair
and
maintenance
costs
.
A
major
consideration
in
the
choice
of
the
Warwick
site
,
four
miles
from
Cranston
,
was
the
fact
that
it
permits
retention
of
our
present
trained
and
highly
skilled
work
force
.
We
have
entered
into
an
agreement
for
the
sale
of
the
present
Cranston
properties
,
effective
as
soon
as
we
have
completed
removal
to
our
new
plant
.
British
subsidiary
During
the
year
our
British
subsidiary
,
Leesona-Holt
,
Limited
,
expanded
its
plant
in
Darwen
,
England
,
and
added
machine
tool
capacity
.
The
operations
of
its
other
plant
in
Rochdale
and
Leesona's
former
operations
in
Manchester
were
transferred
to
a
recently
acquired
plant
in
the
adjoining
town
of
Heywood
.
Layout
and
equipment
were
modernized
and
improved
to
obtain
increased
production
on
an
efficient
basis
.
The
area
available
at
Heywood
is
approximately
three
times
the
size
of
the
former
Rochdale
and
Manchester
locations
.
In
addition
,
land
has
been
purchased
to
permit
doubling
the
size
of
the
plant
in
the
future
.
Financial
developments
The
new
Warwick
plant
is
being
built
at
our
expense
and
under
our
direction
.
It
will
be
transfered
on
completion
to
The
Industrial
Foundation
of
Rhode
Island
,
a
non-profit
organization
,
which
will
reimburse
us
for
the
cost
of
construction
.
We
will
then
occupy
the
new
plant
under
lease
,
with
an
option
to
purchase
.
These
arrangements
are
,
in
our
opinion
,
very
favorable
to
Leesona
.
Interim
financing
of
construction
costs
is
provided
by
a
short
term
loan
from
The
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
.
In
addition
to
expenditures
on
the
Warwick
plant
,
we
have
invested
approximately
$1,961,000
for
machinery
and
equipment
at
Cranston
,
and
for
new
machinery
,
plant
and
equipment
at
Leesona-Holt
,
Limited
.
We
believe
that
these
improved
facilities
will
contribute
income
and
effect
savings
which
will
fully
justify
the
investment
.
Long
term
loans
have
been
reduced
by
$395,000
to
$2,461,000
.
Inventories
increased
$625,561
to
$8,313,514
during
the
year
and
should
decline
in
coming
months
.
Thus
we
enter
1961
in
a
strong
financial
position
.
Employee
contracts
In
accordance
with
the
two-year
contract
signed
in
May
,
1959
,
with
the
International
Association
of
Machinists
,
AFL-CIO
,
wages
of
hourly
employees
were
increased
by
4%
in
May
,
1960
,
and
pay
levels
for
non-exempt
salaried
employees
were
increased
proportionately
.
In
addition
,
Blue
Cross
coverage
for
all
employees
and
their
dependents
was
extended
to
provide
the
full
cost
of
semi-private
hospital
accommodations
.
Personnel
benefits
In
addition
to
direct
salaries
and
wages
,
the
Company
paid
or
accrued
during
the
year
the
following
amounts
for
the
benefit
of
employees
:
During
the
pension
year
ended
December
31
,
1960
,
23
employees
retired
,
making
a
total
of
171
currently
retired
under
the
Company's
pension
plan
.
At
December
13
,
1960
the
fund
held
by
the
Industrial
National
Bank
of
Providence
,
as
trustee
for
payment
of
past
and
future
service
pensions
to
qualified
members
of
the
plan
,
totaled
$2,412,616
.
The
basic
market
for
textiles
is
growing
with
the
expansion
of
the
population
that
began
20
years
ago
.
Another
growth
factor
is
increased
consumer
demand
for
better
quality
and
larger
quantities
of
fabrics
that
go
with
a
rising
standard
of
living
.
As
in
many
other
industries
,
rising
costs
and
intense
competition
,
both
domestic
and
foreign
,
have
exerted
increasing
pressure
on
earnings
of
the
textile
industry
in
recent
years
.
Increased
efficiency
In
textiles
,
as
elsewhere
,
a
major
part
of
the
solution
lies
in
greater
efficiency
and
higher
productivity
.
As
a
designer
and
manufacturer
of
textile
production
machinery
,
Leesona
and
other
companies
in
its
industry
have
sought
to
meet
this
challenge
with
new
or
improved
equipment
and
methods
that
would
increase
production
,
yet
maintain
both
quality
and
flexibility
.
Problems
of
shifting
styles
The
problem
of
efficient
production
in
textiles
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
industry
serves
large
markets
which
shift
quickly
with
changes
of
fashion
in
apparel
or
home
decoration
.
Production
must
be
adjusted
accordingly
,
at
minimum
cost
and
quickly
.
In
addition
,
production
machinery
must
in
many
cases
be
designed
to
handle
with
equal
efficiency
both
natural
fibers
and
the
increasing
number
of
synthetics
,
as
well
as
blends
.
Following
the
term
of
service
in
Japan
,
each
emissary
returns
for
a
brief
visit
to
the
campus
to
interpret
his
experience
to
the
college
community
.
The
Carleton
Service
Fund
provides
the
financial
support
for
this
program
.
Musical
activities
the
college
was
one
of
the
first
to
recognize
the
importance
of
music
not
only
as
a
definite
part
of
the
curriculum
but
as
a
vital
adjunct
to
campus
life
.
Extensive

maintaining
,
under
skilled
direction
,
the

founding
of
the
College
those
responsible
for
its
management
have
planned
to
provide
its
students
favorable
conditions
for
personal
religious
development
and

Carleton
aims
throughout
its
entire
teaching
program
to
represent
a
point
of
view
and
a
spirit
which
will
contribute
to
the
moral
and
religious
development
of
its
students
.

Theater
the
purpose

three-fold
:
to
provide
the
Carleton

with
the
best
possible
opportunity
for
theater-going
within
the
limits
set
by
the
maturity
and
experience
of
the
performers

the
theatrical
facilities
available
;
;
to
encourage
the
practice
of
attending
the
theater
;
;

good
drama
and
sensitive
performance
.
Dramatic
activity
at
the
College
is
organized
and
carried
on
by
The
Carleton
Players
,
which
is
to
say
by
all
students
who
are
so
inclined
to
advance
these
aims
.

is
considered
an
integral
part
of
the
activities
of
the
College
and
operates
under
the
same
budgetary
procedure
and
controls
as
the
academic
work
.
The
physical
education
program
for
men
recognizes
the
value
of
participation
in
competitive
sports
in
the
development
of
the
individual
student
and
aims
to
give
every
man
an
opportunity
to
enter
some
form
of
athletic
competition
,
either
intercollegiate

performance
at
college
apply
to

whole
,
exercises
control
over
the
athletic
program
of
the
College
.

concerns
itself
with
:
1
.
The
policies
which
govern
the

added
the
following
:
1
.

In
recent
months
,
much
attention
has
been
given
to
the
probable
extent
of
the
current
downtrend
in
business
and
economists
are
somewhat
divided
as
to
the
outlook
for
the
near
future
.
And
yet
,
despite
some
disappointment
with
the
performance
of
this
first
year
of
the
new
decade
,
1960
has
been
a
good
year
in
many
ways
,
with
many
overall
measures
of
business
having
reached
new
peaks
for
the
year
as
a
whole
.
The
shift
in
sentiment
from
excessive
optimism
early
in
the
year
to
the
present
mood
of
caution
has
probably
been
a
good
thing
,
in
that
it
has
prevented
the
accumulation
of
the
burdensome
inventories
that
have
characterized
many
previous
swings
in
the
business
cycle
.
This
caution
has
been
particularly
noticeable
in
a
tendency
of
retailers
and
distributors
to
shift
the
inventory
burden
back
on
the
supplier
,
and
the
fact
stocks
at
retail
are
low
in
many
lines
has
escaped
attention
because
of
the
presence
of
higher
stocks
at
the
manufacturing
level
.
In
the
electronics
industry
,
this
tendency
is
well
illustrated
by
inventories
of
TV
sets
.
Factory
stocks
in
recent
months
have
been
the
highest
they
have
been
in
three
years
,
while
those
at
retail
are
below
1959
.
The
total
value
of
our
industry's
shipments
,
at
factory
prices
,
increased
from
$9.2
billion
in
1959
to
approximately
$10.1
billion
as
a
result
of
increases
in
all
of
the
major
segments
of
our
business
--
home
entertainment
,
military
,
industrial
,
and
replacement
.
I
believe
a
further
gain
is
in
prospect
for
1961
.
Home
entertainment
sales
up
Reflecting
the
largest
percentage
of
high-end
sets
such
as
consoles
and
combinations
since
1953
,
dollar
value
of
home
entertainment
electronics
in
1960
was
about
$1.9
billion
,
compared
to
$1.7
billion
in
1959
.
Sales
of
TV
sets
at
retail
ran
ahead
of
the
like
months
of
1959
through
July
;
;
set
production
(
excluding
those
destined
for
the
export
market
)
also
ran
ahead
in
the
early
months
,
but
was
curtailed
after
the
usual
vacation
shutdowns
in
the
face
of
growing
evidence
that
some
of
the
early
production
plans
had
been
overly
optimistic
.
For
the
year
as
a
whole
,
retail
sales
of
TV
sets
probably
came
to
5.8
million
against
5.7
million
in
1959
;
;
however
,
production
came
to
only
5.6
million
compared
to
6.2
million
.
In
contrast
to
the
lower
turnout
of
TV
,
total
radio
production
increased
from
15.4
million
sets
to
16.7
million
(
excluding
export
)
.
Both
home
and
auto
radios
were
in
excellent
demand
,
with
retail
sales
of
home
sets
ahead
of
1959
in
every
month
of
the
first
eleven
;
;
sales
and
production
of
home
sets
were
about
equal
at
10.4
million
units
.
Auto
set
production
came
to
about
6.3
million
compared
to
5.6
million
in
1959
.
Separate
phonographs
also
had
a
good
year
,
reflecting
the
growing
popularity
of
stereo
sound
and
the
same
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
consumer
to
upgrade
that
characterized
the
radio-TV
market
.
The
outlook
for
entertainment
electronics
in
1961
is
certainly
far
from
clear
at
present
,
but
recent
surveys
have
shown
a
desire
on
the
part
of
consumers
to
step
up
their
buying
plans
for
durable
goods
.
I
would
expect
that
sales
at
retail
in
the
first
half
of
1961
might
be
below
1960
by
some
10
-
15%
but
that
second-half
levels
should
show
a
favorable
comparison
,
with
a
possibility
of
quite
strong
demand
late
in
the
year
if
business
conditions
recover
as
some
recent
forecasts
suggest
they
will
.
I
look
for
TV
sales
and
production
to
be
approximately
equal
at
5.7
million
sets
for
the
year
,
but
I
look
for
some
decline
in
radios
from
the
high
rate
in
1961
to
more
nearly
the
1959
level
of
15.0
-
15.5
million
sets
.
I
therefore
believe
it
is
realistic
to
assume
a
modest
drop
in
the
total
value
of
home
entertainment
electronics
to
about
$1.8
million
,
slightly
below
1960
,
but
above
1959
.
Military
electronics
to
grow
1960
witnessed
another
substantial
increase
in
our
industry's
shipments
of
military
electronics
,
which
totalled
about
$5.4
billion
compared
to
$4.9
billion
in
1959
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
present
level
of
military
electronics
procurement
is
greater
than
the
industry's
total
sales
to
all
markets
in
1950-1953
,
which
were
good
years
for
our
industry
with
television
enjoying
its
initial
period
of
rapid
consumer
acceptance
.
It
has
been
correctly
pointed
out
by
well-informed
people
in
the
industry
that
it
is
probably
unrealistic
to
expect
a
continuation
of
the
yearly
growth
of
15%
or
better
that
characterized
the
decade
of
the
1950's
,
and
that
our
military
markets
may
be
entering
upon
a
new
phase
in
which
procurement
of
multiple
weapons
systems
will
give
way
to
concentration
of
still
undeveloped
areas
of
our
defense
capability
.
While
this
may
well
be
true
in
general
,
I
believe
it
is
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
some
recent
developments
suggest
that
over
the
next
year
or
so
military
electronics
may
be
one
of
the
most
strongly
growing
areas
in
an
economy
which
is
not
expanding
rapidly
in
other
directions
.
Among
the
items
scheduled
for
acceleration
in
the
near
future
are
the
Polaris
and
B70
programs
,
strengthening
of
the
airborne
alert
system
of
the
Strategic
Air
Command
,
and
improved
battlefield
surveillance
systems
.
Research
and
development
expenditures
connected
with
the
reconnaissance
satellite
SAMOS
and
the
future
development
of
ballistic
missile
defense
systems
such
as
Nike-Zeus
are
expected
to
increase
substantially
.
Research
,
development
test
and
evaluation
funds
,
devoted
to
missiles
in
1960
were
3
to
4
times
as
large
as
those
devoted
to
aircraft
,
and
actual
missile
procurement
is
expected
to
exceed
aircraft
procurement
by
1963
.
Still
later
,
the
realm
of
space
technology
will
show
substantial
gains
;
;
it
has
been
estimated
that
spending
by
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
will
rise
from
less
than
$500
million
in
fiscal
1960
to
more
than
$2
billion
by
1967
,
and
that
the
electronic
industry's
share
of
these
expenditures
will
be
closer
to
50%
than
the
current
20%
.
The
stepped-up
defense
procurement
called
for
in
the
1961
Budget
has
already
begun
to
make
itself
felt
in
an
upturn
in
orders
for
military
electronic
equipment
and
the
components
that
go
into
it
,
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
an
additional
$2
billion
increase
in
total
defense
spending
may
be
requested
for
fiscal
1962
.
Although
the
impact
of
these
increases
on
our
industry's
shipments
will
be
gradual
,
on
balance
I
look
for
another
good
increase
in
shipments
in
the
coming
year
,
to
at
least
$6
billion
.
Industrial
electronic
equipment
Paced
by
the
continuing
rapid
growth
of
electronic
data
processing
,
sales
of
industrial
and
commercial
electronic
equipment
totalled
$1.8
billion
compared
to
$1.6
billion
in
1959
.
The
market
for
computers
and
other
data-handling
continues
to
expand
at
the
rate
of
about
30%
annually
,
reaching
some
$450
million
in
1960
.
Informed
estimates
look
for
this
market
to
approximately
quadruple
by
the
late
1960's
,
under
the
stimulus
of
new
applications
in
the
fields
of
banking
and
retailing
,
industrial
process
control
,
and
information
storage
and
retrieval
.
In
the
industrial
field
,
prospects
for
higher
expenditures
on
electronic
testing
and
measuring
equipment
are
also
quite
bright
.
For
the
near
term
,
however
,
it
must
be
realized
that
the
industrial
and
commercial
market
is
somewhat
more
sensitive
to
general
business
conditions
than
is
the
military
market
,
and
for
this
reason
I
would
expect
that
any
gain
in
1961
may
be
somewhat
smaller
than
those
of
recent
years
;
;
sales
should
slightly
exceed
1960
,
however
,
and
reach
$1.9
billion
.
Replacement
parts
In
addition
to
the
three
major
original
equipment
segments
of
the
electronics
business
,
the
steady
growth
in
the
market
for
replacement
parts
continues
year
by
year
.
This
is
now
a
$1.0
billion
business
,
up
from
$0.9
billion
in
1959
,
and
should
reach
$1.1
billion
in
1961
.
The
markets
for
electronic
parts
in
1960
have
reflected
the
changing
patterns
of
the
various
end
equipment
segments
of
the
industry
.
Demand
for
parts
for
home
entertainment
was
strong
in
the
first
half
,
but
purchases
were
cut
back
to
lower
levels
during
the
fall
as
set
manufacturers
reduced
their
own
operating
rates
.
In
the
military
field
,
incoming
orders
turned
down
early
in
the
year
,
and
remained
rather
slow
until
late
fall
when
the
upturn
in
procurement
of
equipment
began
to
make
itself
felt
in
rising
orders
for
components
.
Sales
of
transistors
in
1960
exceeded
$300
million
,
compared
to
$222
million
in
1959
despite
substantial
price
reductions
in
virtually
all
types
.
Production
totalled
about
123
million
units
against
82
million
in
1959
,
and
I
look
for
a
further
gain
to
188
million
units
worth
approximately
$380
million
in
1961
.
Sales
of
passive
components
,
such
as
capacitors
and
resistors
,
although
not
growing
as
fast
as
those
of
semi-conductors
were
ahead
of
1959
this
year
,
and
should
increase
again
in
1961
.
In
sum
,
I
look
for
another
good
year
for
the
electronics
industry
in
1961
,
with
total
sales
increasing
about
7%
to
$10.8
billion
,
despite
the
uncertainties
in
the
business
outlook
generally
.
As
I
have
indicated
above
,
I
base
this
feeling
on
a
belief
that
current
weakness
in
the
market
for
consumer
durable
goods
may
continue
through
the
early
months
of
the
year
,
but
will
give
way
to
a
sufficiently
strong
recovery
later
on
to
bring
the
full-year
figures
close
to
those
of
1960
;
;
on
prospects
for
continued
increases
in
defense
spending
;
;
and
on
continued
growth
in
the
applications
of
electronics
to
the
complex
problems
of
manufacturing
and
trade
in
the
expanding
but
competitive
economy
of
the
1960's
.
The
appointment

,
has
been
announced
by
David
B.
Peck
,
Vice
President

Mr.
Devey
will
be
responsible
for
the
commercial
expansion
of
VecTrol's
line
of
electronic
and
electrical
power
control
components
as
furnished
to
end

manufacturers
,
working
closely
with
Walter
J.
Brown
,
President
and
Director
of
Engineering
of
the
recently
acquired
Sprague

.
Mr.
Brown
will
at
the
same
time
undertake
expansion
of
VecTrol's
custom
design
program
for
electronic
control
users
with
a
greatly
increased
engineering
staff
.
Mr.
Devey's
new
responsibilities
are
in
addition
to
those
of
his
present
post

Mr.
Devey
first
came
to
Sprague
in
1953
as
a
Product
Specialist
in
the
Field
Engineering
Department
,
coming
from
the
Office
of
Naval
Research
in
Washington
,
D.
C.
,
where
he
was
an
electronic
scientist
engaged
in
undersea
warfare
studies
.
During
World
War
2
,
,
he
was
a
lieutenant
commander
in
the
United
States
Navy
.
Mr.
Devey
is
a
graduate
of
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
,
and
attended
the
United
States
Naval
Academy
Post-Graduate
School
specializing
in
electronic

.
He
was
named
Product
Manager
of
the
Special
Products
Division
of
Sprague
when
it
was
founded
in
1958
,
and
was
later
promoted
to
his
present
post
.
Mr.
Devey
is
a
member
of
the
Institute
of
Radio
Engineers
,
and
is
chairman
of
the
Electronic
Industries
Association
Committee
on
Printed
and
Modular
Components
.
Mr.
Brown
,
well-known
,
English-born
inventor
,
prior
to
founding
VecTrol
was
at
various
times
section
leader
in
radio
research
at
Metropolitan
Vickers
Electrical
Co.
,
Ltd.
;
;
chief
engineer
of
the
radio
set
division
of
Electric
and
Musical
Industries
,
Ltd.
,
the
largest
electronic
equipment
manufacturer
in
Great
Britain
;
;
director
of
engineering
at
Philco
of
Great

,
and
vice
president
in
charge
of
production
and
assistant
to
the
president
at
The
Brush

Cleveland
,
Ohio
.
He
has
a
Bachelor
of

Mr.
Brown
presently
has
over
130
patents
to
his
credit
dating
back

He
is
a
fellow
of
the
American

He
is
a

The
promotion
of
Robert
E.
Swift
to
the
position
of
Assistant
Manager
of
the
Interference
Control
Field
Service
Department
was
announced
early
in
December
by
Frederick
S.
Scarborough
,
Manager
of
Interference
Control
Field
Service
.
The
appointment
was
made
in
a
move
to
expand
the
engineering
services
offered
to
the
designers
of
electronic
systems
through
assistance
in
electro-magnetic
compatability
problems
.
Between
meetings
he
helps
the
president
keep
track
of
delegated
matters
.
Since
these
duties
fit
neatly
with
those
of
the
proposed
presidential
aide
,
one
person
,
with
adequate
staff
assistance
,
could
fill
both
jobs
.
Since
faculty
see
themselves
as
self-employed
professionals
rather
than
as
employees
,
enthusiasm
in
a
common
enterprise
is
proportionate
to
the
sense
of
ownership
they
have
in
it
by
virtue
of
sharing
in
the
decisions
that
govern
its
course
.
The
faculty
believes
that
broad
autonomy
is
necessary
to
preserve
its
freedom
in
teaching
and
scholarship
.
The
president
expects
faculty
members
to
remember
,
in
exercising
their
autonomy
,
that
they
share
no
collective
responsibility
for
the
university's
income
nor
are
they
personally
accountable
for
top-level
decisions
.
He
may
welcome
their
appropriate
participation
in
the
determination
of
high
policy
,
but
he
has
a
right
to
expect
,
in
return
,
that
they
will
leave
administrative
matters
to
the
administration
.
How
well
do
faculty
members
govern
themselves
?
?
There
is
little
evidence
that
they
are
giving
any
systematic
thought
to
a
general
theory
of
the
optimum
scope
and
nature
of
their
part
in
government
.
They
sometimes
pay
more
attention
to
their
rights
than
to
their
own
internal
problems
of
government
.
They
,
too
,
need
to
learn
to
delegate
.
Letting
the
administration
take
details
off
their
hands
would
give
them
more
time
to
inform
themselves
about
education
as
a
whole
,
an
area
that
would
benefit
by
more
faculty
attention
.
Although
faculties
insist
on
governing
themselves
,
they
grant
little
prestige
to
a
member
who
actively
participates
in
college
or
university
government
.
There
are
,
nevertheless
,
several
things
that
the
president
can
do
to
stimulate
participation
and
to
enhance
the
prestige
of
those
who
are
willing
to
exercise
their
privilege
.
He
can
,
for
example
,
present
significant
university-wide
issues
to
the
senate
.
He
can
encourage
quality
in
faculty
committee
work
in
various
ways
:
by
seeing
to
it
that
the
membership
of
each
committee
represents
the
thoughtful
as
well
as
the
action-oriented
faculty
;
;
by
making
certain
that
no
faculty
member
has
too
many
committee
assignments
;
;
by
assuring
good
liaison
between
the
committees
and
the
administration
;
;
by
minimizing
the
number
of
committees
.
Despite
the
many
avenues
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
between
faculty
and
administration
,
complaints
of
a
lack
of
communication
persist
.
The
cause
is
as
often
neglect
as
hesitance
to
disclose
.
A
busy
president
,
conversant
with
a
problem
and
its
ramifications
and
beset
by
pressures
to
meet
deadlines
,
tends
naturally
to
assume
that
others
must
be
as
familiar
with
a
problem
as
he
is
.
The
need
for
interchange
and
understanding
makes
vital
the
full
use
of
all
methods
of
consultation
.
To
increase
faculty
influence
and
decrease
tension
,
many
presidents
have
established
a
standing
advisory
committee
with
which
they
can
discuss
problems
frankly
.
The
president
has
little
influence
in
day-by-day
curricular
changes
,
but
if
he
looks
ahead
two
,
three
,
or
five
years
to
anticipate
issues
and
throw
out
challenging
ideas
,
he
can
open
the
way
for
innovation
,
and
he
can
also
have
a
great
deal
to
say
as
to
what
path
it
will
take
.
Success
will
require
tact
,
sensitivity
to
faculty
prerogatives
,
patience
,
and
persistence
.
The
critical
task
for
every
president
and
his
academic
administrative
staff
is
to
assure
that
the
college
or
university
continually
rebuilds
and
regenerates
itself
so
that
its
performance
will
match
changing
social
demands
.
Great
professors
do
not
automatically
reproduce
themselves
.
Deans
can
form
an
important
bridge
between
the
president
and
the
faculty
.
They
serve
not
only
as
spokesmen
for
their
areas
,
but
they
also
contribute
to
top-level
decision
making
.
The
president
who
appoints
strong
men
who
have
an
all-college
or
university
point
of
view
and
a
talent
and
respect
for
administration
can
count
on
useful
assistance
.
Faculty
members
depend
on
their
department
chairmen
to
promote
their
interests
with
the
administration
.
The
administration
at
the
same
time
,
looks
to
the
chairmen
for
strategic
aid
in
building
stronger
departments
.
One
way
that
this
can
be
done
,
other
than
by
hiring
new
high-priced
professors
,
is
by
constantly
encouraging
the
department
members
to
raise
their
standards
of
performance
.
The
quality
of
a
president's
leadership
is
measured
first
by
his
success
in
building
up
the
faculty
.
By
supporting
the
efforts
of
the
many
faculty
members
who
are
working
to
attain
ever
higher
standards
,
the
president
can
encourage
faculty
leadership
.
Indirectly
he
can
best
help
them
by
insuring
that
rigorous
criteria
for
appointment
and
promotion
are
clearly
set
forth
and
adhered
to
.
The
academic
dean
should
take
a
direct
,
long-term
interest
in
faculty
development
.
An
alert
dean
will
confer
all
through
the
year
on
personnel
needs
,
plans
for
the
future
,
qualifications
of
those
on
the
job
,
and
bright
prospects
elsewhere
.
For
the
maintenance
of
a
long-term
program
,
the
departments
,
and
particularly
their
chairmen
,
are
strategic
.
They
evaluate
and
nominate
candidates
for
appointment
and
promotion
.
To
provide
an
independent
judgment
for
the
president
,
the
academic
dean
also
investigates
candidates
thoroughly
.
At
some
colleges
and
universities
,
a
faculty
committee
reviews
and
reports
to
the
administration
on
the
qualifications
of
candidates
.
Some
faculty
members
and
many
administrators
oppose
faculty
review
groups
because
they
either
repeat
department's
actions
or
act
pro
forma
.
They
can
be
effective
,
however
,
if
their
members
set
high
standards
for
candidates
and
devote
substantial
time
to
the
work
.
At
one
university
,
the
president
cites
the
faculty
review
committee
as
``
a
valued
partner
of
the
administration
in
guarding
and
promoting
the
quality
of
the
faculty
''
.
Before
the
president
recommends
a
candidate
to
the
trustees
,
the
administration
collects
the
views
of
colleagues
in
the
same
field
of
knowledge
on
campus
and
elsewhere
.
The
president
or
dean
reads
some
of
his
publications
to
form
the
truest
possible
evaluation
of
the
quality
of
his
mind
.
No
good
way
to
evaluate
teaching
ability
has
yet
been
discovered
,
although
some
institutions
use
inventory
sheets
for
a
list
of
criteria
.
To
avoid
passing
over
quiet
,
unaggressive
teachers
as
well
as
to
decide
whether
others
merit
promotion
,
review
of
the
right
of
faculty
members
to
promotion
or
salary
increases
should
be
made
periodically
whether
or
not
they
have
been
recommended
for
advancement
by
their
departments
.
There
are
certain
aspects
of
personnel
development
in
which
a
president
must
involve
himself
directly
.
He
should
personally
consider
the
potential
of
a
faculty
member
proposed
for
tenure
,
to
guard
against
the
mistake
of
making
this
profoundly
serious
commitment
turn
solely
upon
the
man's
former
achievements
.
No
one
can
be
as
effective
as
the
president
in
inspiring
older
men
to
welcome
imaginative
new
teachers
whose
philosophy
or
approach
to
their
specialties
is
quite
different
.
In
particular
,
the
president
may
have
to
summon
all
his
oratorical
powers
to
persuade
department
members
to
accept
an
outstanding
man
above
the
normal
salary
scale
.
On
those
rare
occasions
when
a
faculty
member
on
tenure
is
not
meeting
the
standards
of
the
institution
,
the
president
must
also
bear
the
ultimate
burden
of
decision
and
action
.
A
true
university
,
like
most
successful
marriages
,
is
a
unity
of
diversities
Without
forcing
all
components
into
a
single
pattern
,
the
preparation
of
a
master
plan
is
an
opportunity
to
consider
interrelation
of
knowledge
at
its
highest
level
,
which
a
university
--
in
contrast
to
a
multiversity
--
should
stand
for
.
Recently
colleges
and
universities
have
begun
to
translate
their
educational
philosophy
into
institution-wide
goals
.
Each
year
a
few
more
institutions
are
deciding
such
questions
as
:
Shall
we
require
a
liberal
education
built
around
a
humanities
core
for
all
undergraduates
?
?
Or
shall
we
permit
early
specialization
in
scientific
and
technological
subjects
?
?
In
the
first
instance
,
adequate
appropriate
reading
materials
and
library
accommodations
must
be
planned
.
In
the
second
,
more
shops
,
laboratories
,
and
staff
will
be
required
.
For
the
president
,
a
master
plan
looking
ahead
five
years
(
the
maximum
reach
for
sound
forecasting
)
,
offers
several
practical
advantages
.
Trustees
,
faculty
,
and
administration
can
consider
the
consequences
of
decisions
before
they
are
made
,
instead
of
afterwards
.
Physical
plant
and
equipment
can
be
efficiently
developed
.
Proposed
new
programs
can
be
examined
for
appropriateness
to
goals
and
for
present
and
future
financial
fitness
.
More
than
one
president
has
found
that
a
long-range
plan
helps
him
to
attract
major
gifts
.
It
inspires
confidence
in
his
institution's
determination
to
establish
goals
and
to
achieve
them
.
Before
deciding
where
it
is
going
,
however
,
a
college
or
university
must
know
where
it
is
.
The
first
step
is
a
comprehensive
self
study
made
by
faculty
,
by
outside
consultants
,
or
by
a
combination
of
the
two
.
It
should
sternly
appraise
curricula
,
faculty
,
organization
,
buildings
,
faculty
work
loads
,
and
potential
for
growth
in
stature
and
size
.
Implementation
of
the
master
plan
will
inevitably
be
uneven
.
Some
departments
will
attack
their
new
goals
enthusiastically
;
;
others
may
drag
their
feet
.
Funds
may
be
readily
donated
for
some
purposes
but
not
others
.
A
plan
must
therefore
be
brought
up
to
date
periodically
,
possibly
with
the
assistance
of
a
permanent
planning
officer
.
To
provide
the
continuous
flow
of
information
basic
to
administrative
decisions
,
a
number
of
institutions
have
established
offices
of
institutional
research
.
Some
offices
have
very
broad
responsibilities
,
touching
on
almost
all
aspects
of
a
university's
instructional
program
.
Their
duties
include
evaluation
of
the
information
collected
and
preparation
of
recommendations
.
More
often
,
these
offices
are
restricted
to
the
gathering
of
empirical
data
.
The
president's
opportunity
for
influencing
education
reaches
its
highest
point
,
as
he
decides
which
projects
he
will
cut
back
,
which
he
will
advance
by
increased
allowances
or
new
fund-raising
efforts
.
No
matter
how
high
the
hopes
and
dreams
of
educators
,
budget
making
adjusts
them
to
the
cold
realities
of
dollars
and
cents
.
When
the
budget
goes
to
trustees
for
approval
it
is
the
president's
budget
,
to
which
his
faith
and
credit
are
committed
;
;
its
principal
features
should
be
a
product
of
his
most
considered
judgment
.
He
cannot
,
of
course
,
examine
each
proposal
from
scratch
.
He
reviews
and
shapes
the
work
of
others
to
mold
a
single
joint
product
that
will
best
promote
the
aims
of
the
institution
.
Budgeting
must
be
flexible
to
allow
adaptation
to
the
rapid
changes
in
scientific
and
technological
scholarship
.
Because
scientific
instruction
and
research
involve
increasingly
large
sums
of
money
,
an
institution
should
choose
its
fields
of
prominence
.
Otherwise
it
will
be
headed
for
bankruptcy
,
at
worst
,
and
at
best
towards
starvation
of
other
less
dramatic
but
socially
and
culturally
indispensable
branches
of
learning
.
In
the
national
interest
even
the
affluent
universities
must
consider
some
division
of
labor
among
them
to
replace
their
present
ambitions
to
keep
up
with
the
Joneses
in
all
branches
.
Supporting
activities
--
business
management
,
public
relations
,
fund-raising
--
offer
presidents
one
of
their
best
chances
to
buy
freedom
for
attention
to
education
.
Here
the
reasonable
mastery
of
the
elements
of
administration
can
do
much
to
free
a
president
for
his
primary
role
.
In
the
areas
that
do
not
relate
directly
to
the
educational
program
,
expert
subordinates
will
serve
the
college
or
university
better
than
close
presidential
attention
.
The
president
should
find
strong
subordinates
and
delegate
the
widest
discretion
to
them
.
Higher
education
cannot
compete
with
the
salary
scales
of
the
business
world
,
but
an
educational
institution
can
offer
many
potent
intangible
attractions
to
members
of
the
business
community
that
will
offset
the
differences
in
income
.
Just
as
the
entire
faculty
should
know
the
president's
educational
philosophy
and
objectives
,
so
should
non-academic
officers
.
They
will
better
understand
the
relationship
of
their
activities
to
the
academic
program
and
they
will
be
able
to
explain
their
actions
to
faculty
in
terms
of
mutual
goals
.
A
president
is
frequently
besieged
to
serve
in
non-academic
civic
and
governmental
capacities
,
to
make
speeches
to
lay
groups
,
and
to
make
numerous
ceremonial
appearances
on
and
off
campus
.
Since
he
can
neither
accept
nor
reject
them
all
,
he
must
be
governed
by
the
time
and
energy
available
for
his
prime
professional
obligations
.
Declinations
and
substitutions
are
better
received
when
he
explains
why
his
obligations
to
his
institution
preclude
his
acceptance
.
By
sharing
the
load
of
important
speeches
with
his
colleagues
,
the
president
can
develop
a
cadre
of
able
spokesmen
who
will
help
to
create
a
public
perception
of
the
university
as
an
institution
,
something
more
than
the
lengthened
shadow
of
one
man
.

Introduction
It
has
recently
become
practical
to
use
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
as
a
new
source
of
information
about
these
bodies
and
their
atmospheres
.
The
results
of
present
observations
of
the
thermal
radio
emission
of
the
moon
are
consistent
with
the
very
low
thermal
conductivity
of
the
surface
layer
which
was
derived
from
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
during
eclipses
(
e.g.
,
Garstung
,
1958
)
.
When
sufficiently
accurate
and
complete
measurements
are
available
,
it
will
be
possible
to
set
limits
on
the
thermal
and
electrical
characteristics
of
the
surface
and
subsurface
materials
of
the
moon
.
Observations
of
the
radio
emission
of
a
planet
which
has
an
extensive
atmosphere
will
probe
the
atmosphere
to
a
greater
extent
than
those
using
shorter
wave
lengths
and
should
in
some
cases
give
otherwise
unobtainable
information
about
the
characteristics
of
the
solid
surface
.
Radio
observations
of
Venus
and
Jupiter
have
already
supplied
unexpected
experimental
data
on
the
physical
conditions
of
these
planets
.
The
observed
intensity
of
the
radio
emission
of
Venus
is
much
higher
than
the
expected
thermal
intensity
,
although
the
spectrum
indicated
by
measurements
at
wave
lengths
near
3
cm
and
10
cm
is
like
that
of
a
black
body
at
about
600-degrees
.
This
result
suggests
a
very
high
temperature
at
the
solid
surface
of
the
planet
,
although
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
observed
radiation
may
be
a
combination
of
both
thermal
and
non-thermal
components
and
that
the
observed
spectrum
is
that
of
a
black
body
merely
by
coincidence
.
For
the
case
of
Jupiter
,
the
radio
emission
spectrum
is
definitely
not
like
the
spectrum
of
a
black-body
radiator
,
and
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
radiation
reaching
the
earth
is
a
combination
of
thermal
radiation
from
the
atmosphere
and
non-thermal
components
.
Of
the
remaining
planets
,
only
Mars
and
Saturn
have
been
observed
as
radio
sources
,
and
not
very
much
information
is
available
.
Mars
has
been
observed
twice
at
about
3-cm
wave
length
,
and
the
intensity
of
the
observed
radiation
is
in
reasonable
agreement
with
the
thermal
radiation
which
might
be
predicted
on
the
basis
of
the
known
temperature
of
Mars
.
The
low
intensity
of
the
radiation
from
Saturn
has
limited
observations
,
but
again
the
measured
radiation
seems
to
be
consistent
with
a
thermal
origin
.
No
attempts
to
measure
the
radio
emission
of
the
remaining
planets
have
been
reported
,
and
,
because
of
their
distances
,
small
diameters
,
or
low
temperatures
,
the
thermal
radiation
at
radio
wave
lengths
reaching
the
earth
from
these
sources
is
expected
to
be
of
very
low
intensity
.
In
spite
of
this
,
the
very
large
radio
reflectors
and
improved
amplifying
techniques
which
are
now
becoming
available
should
make
it
possible
to
observe
the
radio
emission
of
most
of
the
planets
in
a
few
years
.
The
study
of
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
began
with
the
detection
of
the
thermal
radiation
of
the
moon
at
1.25-cm
wave
length
by
Dicke
and
Beringer
(
1946
)
.
This
was
followed
by
a
comprehensive
series
of
observations
of
the
1.25-cm
emission
of
the
moon
over
three
lunar
cycles
by
Piddington
and
Minnett
(
1949
)
.
They
deduced
from
their
measurements
that
the
radio
emission
from
the
whole
disk
of
the
moon
varied
during
a
lunation
in
a
roughly
sinusoidal
fashion
;
;
that
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
was
considerably
less
than
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
as
measured
by
Pettit
and
Nicholson
(
1930
)
and
Pettit
(
1935
)
;
;
and
that
the
maximum
of
the
radio
emission
came
about
3-1/2
days
after
Full
Moon
,
which
is
again
in
contrast
to
the
infrared
emission
,
which
reaches
its
maximum
at
Full
Moon
.
Piddington
and
Minnett
explained
their
observations
by
pointing
out
that
rocklike
materials
which
are
likely
to
make
up
the
surface
of
the
moon
would
be
partially
transparent
to
radio
waves
,
although
opaque
to
infrared
radiation
.
The
infrared
emission
could
then
be
assumed
to
originate
at
the
surface
of
the
moon
,
while
the
radio
emission
originates
at
some
depth
beneath
the
surface
,
where
the
temperature
variation
due
to
solar
radiation
is
reduced
in
amplitude
and
shifted
in
phase
.
Since
the
absorption
of
radio
waves
in
rocklike
material
varies
with
wave
length
,
it
should
be
possible
to
sample
the
temperature
variation
at
different
depths
beneath
the
surface
and
possibly
detect
changes
in
the
structure
or
composition
of
the
lunar
surface
material
.
The
radio
emission
of
a
planet
was
first
detected
in
1955
,
when
Burke
and
Franklin
(
1955
)
identified
the
origin
of
interference-like
radio
noise
on
their
records
at
about
15
meters
wave
length
as
emission
from
Jupiter
.
This
sporadic
type
of
planetary
radiation
is
discussed
by
Burke
(
chap.
13
)
and
Gallet
(
chap.
14
)
.
Steady
radiation
which
was
presumably
of
thermal
origin
was
observed
from
Venus
at
3.15
and
9.4
cm
,
and
from
Mars
and
Jupiter
at
3.15
cm
in
1956
(
Mayer
,
McCullough
,
and
Sloanaker
,
1958
,
A
,
B
,
C
)
,
and
from
Saturn
at
3.75
cm
in
1957
(
Drake
and
Ewen
,
1958
)
.
In
the
relatively
short
time
since
these
early
observations
,
Venus
has
been
observed
at
additional
wave
lengths
in
the
range
from
0.8
to
10.2
cm
,
and
Jupiter
has
been
observed
over
the
wave-length
range
from
3.03
to
68
Aj
.
The
observable
characteristics
of
planetary
radio
radiation
are
the
intensity
,
the
polarization
,
and
the
direction
of
arrival
of
the
waves
.
The
maximum
angular
diameter
of
any
planetary
disk
as
observed
from
the
earth
is
about
1
minute
of
arc
.
This
is
much
smaller
than
the
highest
resolution
of
even
the
very
large
reflectors
now
under
construction
,
and
consequently
the
radio
emission
of
different
regions
of
the
disk
cannot
be
resolved
.
It
should
be
possible
,
however
,
to
put
useful
limits
on
the
diameters
of
the
radio
sources
by
observing
with
large
reflectors
or
with
interferometers
.
Measurements
of
polarization
are
presently
limited
by
apparatus
sensitivity
and
will
remain
difficult
because
of
the
low
intensity
of
the
planetary
radiation
at
the
earth
.
There
have
been
few
measurements
specifically
for
the
determination
of
the
polarization
of
planetary
radiation
.
The
measurements
made
with
the
NRL
50-foot
reflector
,
which
is
altitude-azimuth-mounted
,
would
have
shown
a
systematic
change
with
local
hour
angle
in
the
measured
intensities
of
Venus
and
Jupiter
if
a
substantial
part
of
the
radiation
had
been
linearly
polarized
.
Recent
interferometer
measurements
(
Radhakrishnan
and
Roberts
,
1960
)
have
shown
the
960-mc
emission
of
Jupiter
to
be
partially
polarized
and
to
originate
in
a
region
of
larger
diameter
than
the
visible
disk
.
Other
than
this
very
significant
result
,
most
of
the
information
now
available
about
the
radio
emission
of
the
planets
is
restricted
to
the
intensity
of
the
radiation
.
The
concept
of
apparent
black-body
temperature
is
used
to
describe
the
radiation
received
from
the
moon
and
the
planets
.
The
received
radiation
is
compared
with
the
radiation
from
a
hypothetical
black
body
which
subtends
the
same
solid
angle
as
the
visible
disk
of
the
planet
.
The
apparent
black-body
disk
temperature
is
the
temperature
which
must
be
assumed
for
the
black
body
in
order
that
the
intensity
of
its
radiation
should
equal
that
of
the
observed
radiation
.
The
use
of
this
concept
does
not
specify
the
origin
of
the
radiation
,
and
only
if
the
planet
really
radiates
as
a
black
body
,
will
the
apparent
black-body
temperature
correspond
to
the
physical
temperature
of
the
emitting
material
.
The
radio
radiation
of
the
sun
which
is
reflected
from
the
moon
and
planets
should
be
negligible
compared
with
their
thermal
emission
at
centimeter
wave
lengths
,
except
possibly
at
times
of
exceptional
outbursts
of
solar
radio
noise
.
The
quiescent
level
of
centimeter
wave-length
solar
radiation
would
increase
the
average
disk
brightness
temperature
by
less
than
1-degree
.
At
meter
wave
lengths
an
increase
of
the
order
of
10-degrees
in
the
average
disk
temperatures
of
the
nearer
planets
would
be
expected
.
Therefore
,
neglecting
the
extreme
outbursts
,
reflected
solar
radiation
is
not
expected
to
cause
sizable
errors
in
the
measurements
of
planetary
radiation
in
the
centimeter-
and
decimeter-wave-length
range
.

The
moon
2.1
observations
Radio
observations
of
the
moon
have
been
made
over
the
range
of
wave
lengths
from
4.3
mm
to
75
cm
,
and
the
results
are
summarized
in
Table
1
.
Observations
have
also
been
made
at
1.5
mm
using
optical
techniques
(
Sinton
,
1955
,
1956
,
;
;
see
also
chap.
11
)
.
Not
all
the
observers
have
used
the
same
procedures
or
made
the
same
assumptions
about
the
lunar
brightness
distribution
when
reducing
the
data
,
and
this
,
together
with
differences
in
the
methods
of
calibrating
the
antennae
and
receivers
,
must
account
for
much
of
the
disagreement
in
the
measured
radio
brightness
temperatures
.
In
the
observations
at
4.3
mm
(
Coates
,
1959
)
,
the
diameter
of
the
antenna
beam
,
6'.7
,
was
small
enough
to
allow
resolution
of
some
of
the
larger
features
of
the
lunar
surface
,
and
contour
diagrams
have
been
made
of
the
lunar
brightness
distribution
at
three
lunar
phases
.
These
observations
indicate
that
the
lunar
maria
heat
up
more
rapidly
and
also
cool
off
more
rapidly
than
do
the
mountainous
regions
.
Mare
Imbrium
seems
to
be
an
exception
and
remains
cooler
than
the
regions
which
surround
it
.
These
contour
diagrams
also
suggest
a
rather
rapid
falloff
in
the
radio
brightness
with
latitude
.
Very
recently
,
observations
have
been
made
at
8-mm
wave
length
with
a
reflector
22
meters
in
diameter
with
a
resultant
beam
width
of
only
about
2'
(
Amenitskii
,
Noskova
,
and
Salomonovich
,
1960
)
.
The
constant-temperature
contours
are
much
smoother
than
those
observed
at
4.3
mm
by
Coates
(
1959
)
and
apparently
the
emission
at
8
mm
is
not
nearly
so
sensitive
to
differences
in
surface
features
.
Such
high-resolution
observations
as
these
are
needed
at
several
wave
lengths
in
order
that
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
can
be
properly
interpreted
.
The
observations
of
Mayer
,
McCullough
,
and
Sloanaker
at
3.15
cm
and
of
Sloanaker
at
10.3
cm
have
not
previously
been
published
and
will
be
briefly
described
.
Measurements
at
3.15
cm
were
obtained
on
11
days
spread
over
the
interval
May
3
to
June
19
,
1956
,
using
the
50-foot
reflector
at
the
U.
S.
Naval
Research
Laboratory
in
Washington
.
The
half-intensity
diameter
of
the
antenna
beam
was
about
9'
,
and
the
angle
subtended
by
the
moon
included
the
entire
main
beam
and
part
of
the
first
side
lobes
.
The
antenna
patterns
and
the
power
gain
at
the
peak
of
the
beam
were
both
measured
(
Mayer
,
McCullough
,
and
Sloanaker
,
1958
)
,
so
that
the
absolute
power
sensitivity
of
the
antenna
beam
over
the
solid
angle
of
the
moon
was
known
.
The
ratio
of
the
measured
antenna
temperature
change
during
a
drift
scan
across
the
moon
to
the
average
brightness
temperature
of
the
moon
over
the
antenna
beam
(
assuming
that
the
brightness
temperature
of
the
sky
is
negligible
)
was
found
,
by
graphical
integration
of
the
antenna
directivity
diagram
,
to
be
0.85
.
The
measured
brightness
temperature
is
a
good
approximation
to
the
brightness
temperature
at
the
center
of
the
lunar
disk
because
of
the
narrow
antenna
beam
and
because
the
temperature
distribution
over
the
central
portion
of
the
moon's
disk
is
nearly
uniform
.
The
result
of
the
observations
is
Af
where
the
phase
angle
,
Q
,
is
measured
in
degrees
from
new
moon
and
the
probable
errors
include
absolute
as
well
as
relative
errors
.
This
result
is
plotted
along
with
the
8.6-mm
observations
of
Gibson
(
1958
)
in
figure
1
,
A
.
The
variation
in
the
3-cm
emission
of
the
moon
during
a
lunation
is
very
much
less
than
the
variation
in
the
8.6-mm
emission
,
as
would
be
expected
from
the
explanation
of
Piddington
and
Minnett
(
1949
)
.
In
the
discussion
which
follows
,
the
time
average
of
the
radio
emission
will
be
referred
to
as
the
constant
component
,
and
the
superimposed
periodic
variation
will
be
called
the
variable
component
.
The
10.3-cm
observation
of
Sloanaker
was
made
on
May
20
,
1958
,
using
the
84-foot
reflector
at
the
Maryland
Point
Observatory
of
the
U.
S.
Naval
Research
Laboratory
.
The
age
of
the
moon
was
about
2
days
.
The
half-intensity
diameter
of
the
main
lobe
of
the
antenna
was
about
18'.5
,
and
the
brightness
temperature
was
reduced
by
assuming
a
Gaussian
shape
for
the
antenna
beam
and
a
uniformly
bright
disk
for
the
moon
.
Abstract
Experiments
were
made
on
an
electric
arc
applying
a
porous
graphite
anode
cooled
by
a
transpiring
gas
(
Argon
)
.
Thus
,
the
energy
transferred
from
the
arc
to
the
anode
was
partly
fed
back
into
the
arc
.
It
was
shown
that
by
proper
anode
design
the
net
energy
loss
of
the
arc
to
the
anode
could
be
reduced
to
approximately
15%
of
the
total
arc
energy
.
A
detailed
energy
balance
of
the
anode
was
established
.
The
anode
ablation
could
be
reduced
to
a
negligible
amount
.
The
dependence
of
the
arc
voltage
upon
the
mass
flow
velocity
of
the
transpirating
gas
was
investigated
for
various
arc
lengths
and
currents
between
100
Amp
and
200
Aj
.
Qualitative
observations
were
made
and
high-speed
motion
pictures
were
taken
to
study
flow
phenomena
in
the
arc
at
various
mass
flow
velocities
.
Introduction
The
high
heat
fluxes
existing
at
the
electrode
surfaces
of
electric
arcs
necessitate
extensive
cooling
to
prevent
electrode
ablation
.
The
cooling
requirements
are
particularly
severe
at
the
anode
.
In
free-burning
electric
arcs
,
for
instance
,
approximately
90%
of
the
total
arc
power
is
transferred
to
the
anode
giving
rise
to
local
heat
fluxes
in
excess
of
Af
as
measured
by
the
authors
--
the
exact
value
depending
on
the
arc
atmosphere
.
In
plasma
generators
as
currently
commercially
available
for
industrial
use
or
as
high
temperature
research
tools
often
more
than
50%
of
the
total
energy
input
is
being
transferred
to
the
cooling
medium
of
the
anode
.
The
higher
heat
transfer
rates
at
the
anode
compared
with
those
at
the
cathode
can
be
explained
by
the
physical
phenomena
occurring
in
free
burning
arcs
.
In
plasma
generators
the
superimposed
forced
convection
may
modify
the
picture
somewhat
.
The
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
is
due
to
the
following
effects
:
1
.
Heat
of
condensation
(
work
function
)
plus
kinetic
energy
of
the
electrons
impinging
on
the
anode
.
This
energy
transfer
depends
on
the
current
,
the
temperature
in
the
arc
column
,
the
anode
material
,
and
the
conditions
in
the
anode
sheath
.
2
.
Heat
transfer
by
molecular
conduction
as
well
as
by
radiation
from
the
arc
column
.
The
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
in
free
burning
arcs
is
enhanced
by
a
hot
gas
jet
flowing
from
the
cathode
towards
the
anode
with
velocities
up
Af
.
This
phenomenon
has
been
experimentally
investigated
in
detail
by
Maecker
(
Ref.
1
)
.
The
pressure
gradient
producing
the
jet
is
due
to
the
nature
of
the
magnetic
field
in
the
arc
(
rapid
decrease
of
current
density
from
cathode
to
the
anode
)
.
Hence
,
the
flow
conditions
at
the
anode
of
free
burning
arcs
resemble
those
near
a
stagnation
point
.
It
is
apparent
from
the
above
and
from
experimental
evidence
that
the
cooling
requirements
for
the
anode
of
free
burning
arcs
are
large
compared
with
those
for
the
cathode
.
The
gas
flow
through
a
plasma
generator
will
modify
these
conditions
;
;
however
,
the
anode
is
still
the
part
receiving
the
largest
heat
flux
.
An
attempt
to
improve
the
life
of
the
anodes
or
the
efficiency
of
the
plasma
generators
must
,
therefore
,
aim
at
a
reduction
of
the
anode
loss
.
The
following
possibilities
exist
for
achieving
this
:
1
.
The
use
of
high
voltages
and
low
currents
by
proper
design
to
reduce
electron
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
for
a
given
power
output
.
2
.
Continuous
motion
of
the
arc
contact
area
at
the
anode
by
flow
or
magnetic
forces
.
3
.
Feedback
of
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
applying
gas
transpiration
through
the
anode
.
The
third
method
was
,
to
our
knowledge
,
successfully
applied
for
the
first
time
by
C.
Sheer
and
co-workers
(
Ref.
2
)
.
The
purpose
of
the
present
study
is
to
study
the
thermal
conditions
and
to
establish
an
energy
balance
for
a
transpiration
cooled
anode
as
well
as
the
effect
of
blowing
on
the
arc
voltage
.
Gas
injection
through
a
porous
anode
(
transpiration
cooling
)
not
only
feeds
back
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
the
above
mentioned
processes
,
but
also
modifies
the
conditions
in
the
arc
itself
.
A
detailed
study
of
this
latter
phenomenon
was
not
attempted
in
this
paper
.
Argon
was
used
as
a
blowing
gas
to
exclude
any
effects
of
dissociation
or
chemical
reaction
.
The
anode
material
was
porous
graphite
.
Sintered
porous
metals
should
be
usable
in
principle
.
However
,
technical
difficulties
arise
by
melting
at
local
hot
spots
.
The
experimental
arrangement
as
described
below
is
based
on
the
geometry
of
free
burning
arcs
.
Thus
,
direct
comparisons
can
be
drawn
with
free
burning
arcs
which
have
been
studied
in
detail
during
the
past
years
and
decades
by
numerous
investigators
(
Ref.
3
)
.
Experimental
apparatus
Figures
1
to
3
show
photographic
and
schematic
views
of
the
test
stand
and
of
two
different
models
of
the
anode
holder
.
The
cathode
consisted
of
a
1/4''
''
diameter
thoriated
tungsten
rod
attached
to
a
water
cooled
copper
tube
.
This
tube
could
be
adjusted
in
its
axial
direction
by
an
electric
drive
to
establish
the
required
electrode
spacing
.
The
anode
in
figure
2
was
mounted
by
means
of
the
anode
holder
which
was
attached
to
a
steel
plug
and
disk
.
The
transpiring
gas
ejected
from
the
anode
formed
a
jet
directed
axially
towards
the
cathode
below
.
Inflow
of
air
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
prevented
by
the
two
disks
shown
in
figure
2
.
Argon
was
also
blown
at
low
velocities
(
mass
flow
rate
Af
)
through
a
tube
coaxial
with
the
cathode
as
an
additional
precaution
against
contamination
of
the
arc
by
air
.
The
anode
consisted
of
a
1/2
inch
diameter
porous
graphite
plug
,
1/4
inch
long
.
The
graphite
was
National
Carbon
NC
60
,
which
has
a
porosity
of
50%
and
an
average
pore
size
of
30
.
This
small
pore
size
was
required
to
ensure
uniformity
of
the
flow
leaving
the
anode
.
The
anode
plug
(
Figure
2
)
was
inserted
into
a
carbon
anode
holder
.
A
shielded
thermocouple
was
used
to
measure
the
upstream
temperature
of
the
transpiring
gas
.
It
was
exposed
to
a
high
velocity
gas
jet
.
A
plug
and
a
tube
with
holes
in
its
cylindrical
walls
divided
the
chamber
above
the
porous
plug
into
two
parts
.
This
arrangement
had
the
purpose
to
prevent
heated
gas
to
reach
the
thermocouple
by
natural
convection
.
Two
pyrometers
shown
in
figure
1
and
2
(
Pyrometer
Instrument
Co.

)
served
for
simultaneous
measurement
of
the
anode
surface
temperature
and
the
temperature
distribution
along
the
anode
holder
.
Three
thermocouples
were
placed
at
different
locations
in
the
aluminum
disk
surrounding
the
anode
holder
to
determine
its
temperature
.
Another
anode
holder
used
in
the
experiments
is
shown
in
figure
3
.
In
this
design
the
anode
holder
is
water
cooled
and
the
heat
losses
by
conduction
from
the
anode
were
determined
by
measuring
the
temperature
rise
of
the
coolant
.
To
reduce
heat
transfer
from
the
hot
gas
to
this
anode
holder
outside
the
regime
of
the
arc
,
a
carbon
shield
was
attached
to
the
surface
providing
an
air
gap
of
1/16
inch
between
the
plate
and
the
surface
of
the
anode
holder
.
In
addition
,
the
inner
surface
of
the
carbon
shield
was
covered
with
aluminum
foil
to
reduce
radiation
.
Temperatures
of
the
shield
and
of
the
surface
of
the
water-cooled
anode
holder
were
measured
by
thermocouples
to
account
for
heat
received
by
the
coolant
but
not
originating
from
the
anode
plug
.
The
argon
flow
from
commercial
bottles
was
regulated
by
a
pressure
regulator
and
measured
with
a
gas
flow
rator
.
The
power
source
was
a
commercial
D.
C.
rectifier
.
At
100
Amp
the
360
cycle
ripple
was
less
than
0.5
V
(
peak
to
peak
)
with
a
resistive
load
.
The
current
was
regulated
by
means
of
a
variable
resistor
and
measured
with
a
50
mV
shunt
and
millivoltmeter
.
The
arc
voltage
was
measured
with
a
voltmeter
whose
terminals
were
connected
to
the
anode
and
cathode
holders
.
Because
of
the
falling
characteristic
of
the
rectifier
,
no
ballast
resistor
was
required
for
stability
of
operation
.
A
high
frequency
starter
was
used
to
start
the
arc
.

Transpiration
cooled
anode
with
carbon
anode
holder
The
anode
holder
shown
in
figure
2
was
designed
with
two
goals
in
mind
.
The
heat
losses
of
the
holder
were
to
be
reduced
as
far
as
possible
and
they
should
be
such
that
an
accurate
heat
balance
can
be
made
.
In
order
to
reduce
the
number
of
variable
parameters
,
all
experiments
were
made
with
a
constant
arc
length
of
0.5''
''
and
a
current
of
100
Aj
.
The
argon
flow
through
the
porous
anode
was
varied
systematically
between
Af
and
Af
.
The
lower
limit
was
determined
by
the
fact
that
for
smaller
flow
rates
the
arc
started
to
strike
to
the
anode
holder
instead
of
to
the
porous
graphite
plug
and
that
it
became
highly
unstable
.
The
upper
limit
was
determined
by
the
difficulty
of
measuring
the
characteristic
anode
surface
temperature
(
see
below
)
since
only
a
small
region
of
the
anode
was
struck
by
the
arc
.
This
region
which
had
a
higher
temperature
than
the
rest
of
the
anode
surface
changed
size
and
location
continuously
.
For
each
mass
flow
rate
the
arc
voltage
was
measured
.
To
measure
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
plug
,
the
surface
was
scanned
with
a
pyrometer
.
As
it
turned
out
,
a
very
hot
region
occurred
on
the
plug
.
Its
temperature
was
denoted
by
Af
.
The
size
of
this
hot
region
was
estimated
by
eye
.
The
rest
of
the
surface
had
a
temperature
which
decreased
towards
the
outer
diameter
of
the
plug
.
The
mean
temperature
of
this
region
was
approximated
by
the
temperature
measured
halfways
between
the
edge
of
the
hot
spot
and
the
rim
of
the
plug
.
It
was
denoted
by
Af
.
The
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
was
then
computed
according
to
the
following
relation
:
Af
where
x
is
the
fraction
of
the
plug
area
covered
by
the
hot
spot
.
Assuming
thermal
equilibrium
between
the
anode
surface
and
the
transpiring
argon
,
the
gas
enthalpy
rise
through
the
anode
was
calculated
according
to
the
relation
Af
whereby
the
specific
heat
of
argon
was
taken
as
Af
.
This
calculation
results
in
an
enthalpy
rise
which
is
somewhat
high
because
it
assumes
a
mass
flow
equally
distributed
over
the
plug
cross
section
whereas
in
reality
the
mass
velocity
is
expected
to
be
smaller
in
the
regions
of
higher
temperatures
.
The
upstream
gas
temperature
measured
with
the
thermocouple
shown
in
figure
2
was
Af
.
The
Af
values
are
listed
in
Table
1
together
with
the
measured
surface
temperatures
and
arc
voltages
.
Simultaneously
with
the
anode
surface
temperature
and
voltage
measurements
pyrometer
readings
were
taken
along
the
cylindrical
surface
of
the
carbon
anode
holder
as
indicated
on
figure
2
.
Some
of
these
temperatures
are
plotted
in
figure
4
.
They
showed
no
marked
dependence
on
the
flow
rate
within
the
accuracy
of
these
measurements
.
Thus
,
the
dotted
line
shown
in
figure
4
was
taken
as
typical
for
the
temperature
distribution
for
all
blowing
rates
.
The
thermocouples
in
the
aluminum
disk
shown
in
figure
2
indicated
an
equilibrium
temperature
of
the
surface
of
Af
.
This
temperature
was
taken
as
environmental
temperature
to
which
the
anode
holder
was
exposed
as
far
as
radiation
is
concerned
.
It
is
sufficiently
small
compared
with
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
holder
,
to
make
the
energy
flux
radiated
from
the
environment
toward
the
anode
holder
negligible
within
the
accuracy
of
the
present
measurements
.
The
reflection
of
radiation
originating
from
the
anode
holder
and
reflected
back
to
it
by
the
surrounding
metal
surfaces
should
also
be
small
because
of
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
metal
surfaces
and
of
the
specific
geometry
.
The
total
heat
loss
through
the
anode
holder
included
also
the
heat
conducted
through
the
base
of
the
cylindrical
piece
into
the
adjacent
metal
parts
.
It
was
calculated
from
the
temperature
gradient
Af
at
Af
inch
as
Af
.
The
total
heat
flux
from
the
porous
plug
into
the
plug
holder
is
thereby
Af
.
The
temperature
distribution
of
figure
4
gives
Af
for
all
blowing
rates
,
assuming
Af
.
The
temperature
dependent
value
of
**ye
was
taken
from
Ref.
7
.
The
radiation
loss
from
the
anode
surface
was
computed
according
to
Af
where
Af
is
the
mean
of
the
fourth
powers
of
the
temperatures
Af
and
Af
calculated
analogously
to
equation
(
1
)
.
A
band
viscometer
is
shown
in
Figure
2
.
It
consists
of
two
blocks
with
flat
surfaces
held
apart
by
shims
.
There
is
a
small
well
in
the
top
in
which
the
fluid
or
paste
to
be
tested
is
placed
.
A
tape
of
cellulose
acetate
is
pulled
between
the
blocks
and
the
tape
pulls
the
fluid
or
paste
with
it
between
the
parallel
faces
of
the
blocks
.
In
normal
use
weights
are
hung
on
the
end
of
the
tape
and
allowed
to
pull
the
tape
and
the
material
to
be
tested
between
the
blocks
.
After
it
has
reached
terminal
velocity
,
the
time
for
the
tape
to
travel
a
known
distance
is
recorded
.
By
the
use
of
various
weights
,
data
for
a
force-rate
of
shear
graph
can
be
obtained
.
The
instrument
used
for
this
work
was
a
slight
modification
of
that
previously
described
.
In
this
test
a
Af
tape
was
pulled
between
the
blocks
with
a
motor
and
pulley
at
a
rate
of
Af
with
a
clearance
of
0.002''
''
on
each
side
of
the
tape
.
This
gives
a
rate
of
shear
of
Af
.
This
,
however
,
can
only
be
considered
approximate
,
as
the
diameter
of
the
pulley
was
increased
by
the
build-up
of
tape
and
the
tape
was
occasionally
removed
from
the
pulley
during
the
runs
.
The
face
of
one
block
contained
a
hole
1/16''
''
in
diameter
which
led
to
a
manometer
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressure
.
Although
there
were
only
four
fluids
tested
,
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
two
distinct
types
.
Two
of
the
fluids
showed
a
high-positive
normal
pressure
when
undergoing
shear
,
and
two
showed
small
negative
pressures
which
were
negligible
in
comparison
with
the
amount
of
the
positive
pressures
generated
by
the
other
two
.
Figure
3
shows
the
data
on
a
silicone
fluid
,
labeled
12,500
cps
which
gave
a
high
positive
normal
pressure
.
Although
the
tape
was
run
for
over
1
hr.
,
a
steady
state
was
not
reached
,
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
back
pressure
of
the
manometer
was
built
up
from
the
material
fed
from
between
the
blocks
and
this
was
available
at
a
very
slow
rate
.
A
system
had
to
be
used
which
did
not
depend
upon
the
feeding
of
the
fluid
into
the
manometer
if
measurements
of
the
normal
pressure
were
to
be
made
in
a
reasonable
time
.
A
back
pressure
was
then
introduced
,
and
the
rise
or
fall
of
the
material
in
the
manometer
indicated
which
was
greater
,
the
normal
pressure
in
the
block
or
the
back
pressure
.
By
this
method
it
was
determined
that
the
normal
pressure
exerted
by
a
sample
of
polybutene
(
molecular
weight
reported
to
be
770
)
was
over
half
an
atmosphere
.
The
actual
pressure
was
not
determined
because
the
pressure
was
beyond
the
upper
limit
of
the
apparatus
on
hand
.
The
two
fluids
which
gave
the
small
negative
pressures
were
polybutenes
with
molecular
weights
which
were
stated
to
be
520
and
300
.
These
are
fluids
which
one
would
expect
to
be
less
viscoelastic
or
more
Newtonian
because
of
their
lower
molecular
weight
.
The
maximum
suction
was
3.25''
''
of
test
fluid
measured
from
the
top
of
the
block
,
and
steady
states
were
apparently
reached
with
these
fluids
.
It
is
presumed
that
this
negative
head
was
associated
with
some
geometric
factor
of
the
assembly
,
since
different
readings
were
obtained
with
the
same
fluid
and
the
only
apparent
difference
was
the
assembly
and
disassembly
of
the
apparatus
.
This
negative
pressure
is
not
explained
by
the
velocity
head
Af
since
this
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
readings
by
several
magnitudes
.
These
experiments
can
be
considered
exploratory
only
.
However
,
they
do
demonstrate
the
presence
of
large
normal
pressures
in
the
presence
of
flat
shear
fields
which
were
forecast
by
the
theory
in
the
first
part
of
the
paper
.
They
also
give
information
which
will
aid
in
the
design
of
a
more
satisfactory
instrument
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressures
.
Such
an
instrument
would
be
useful
for
the
characterization
of
many
commercial
materials
as
well
as
theoretical
studies
.
The
elasticity
is
a
parameter
of
fluids
which
is
not
subject
to
simple
measurement
at
present
,
and
it
is
a
parameter
which
is
probably
varying
in
an
unknown
manner
with
many
commercial
materials
.
Such
an
instrument
is
expected
to
be
especially
useful
if
it
could
be
used
to
measure
the
elasticity
of
heavy
pastes
such
as
printing
inks
,
paints
,
adhesives
,
molten
plastics
,
and
bread
dough
,
for
the
elasticity
is
related
to
those
various
properties
termed
``
length
''
,
``
shortness
''
,
``
spinnability
''
,
etc.
,
which
are
usually
judged
by
subjective
methods
at
present
.
The
actual
change
Af
caused
by
a
shear
field
is
calculated
by
multiplying
the
pressure
differential
times
the
volume
,
just
as
it
is
for
any
gravitational
or
osmotic
pressure
head
.
If
the
volume
is
the
molal
volume
,
then
Af
is
obtained
on
a
molal
basis
which
is
the
customary
terminology
of
the
chemists
.
Although
the
Af
calculation
is
obvious
by
analogy
with
that
for
gravitational
field
and
osmotic
pressure
,
it
is
interesting
to
confirm
it
by
a
method
which
can
be
generalized
to
include
related
effects
.
Consider
a
shear
field
with
a
height
of
H
and
a
cross-sectional
area
of
A
opposed
by
a
manometer
with
a
height
of
H
(
referred
to
the
same
base
as
H
)
and
a
cross-sectional
area
of
A
.
If
Af
is
the
change
per
unit
volume
in
Gibbs
function
caused
by
the
shear
field
at
constant
P
and
T
,
and
**yr
is
the
density
of
the
fluid
,
then
the
total
potential
energy
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
Af
.
Af
is
the
work
necessary
to
fill
the
manometer
column
from
the
reference
height
to
H
.
The
total
volume
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
Af
,
and
H
can
be
eliminated
to
obtain
an
equation
for
the
total
potential
energy
of
the
system
in
terms
of
H
.
The
minimum
total
potential
energy
is
found
by
taking
the
derivative
with
respect
to
H
and
equating
to
zero
.
This
gives
Af
,
which
is
the
pressure
.
This
is
interesting
for
it
combines
both
the
thermodynamic
concept
of
a
minimum
Gibbs
function
for
equilibrium
and
minimum
mechanical
potential
energy
for
equilibrium
.
This
method
can
be
extended
to
include
the
concentration
differences
caused
by
shear
fields
.
The
relation
between
osmotic
pressure
and
the
Gibbs
function
may
also
be
developed
in
an
analogous
way
.
In
the
above
development
we
have
applied
the
thermodynamics
of
equilibrium
(
referred
to
by
some
as
thermostatics
)
to
the
steady
state
.
This
can
be
justified
thermodynamically
in
this
case
,
and
this
will
be
done
in
a
separate
paper
which
is
being
prepared
.
This
has
an
interesting
analogy
with
the
assumption
stated
by
Philippoff
that
``
the
deformational
mechanics
of
elastic
solids
can
be
applied
to
flowing
solutions
''
.
There
is
one
exception
to
the
above
statement
as
has
been
pointed
out
,
and
that
is
that
fluids
can
relax
by
flowing
into
fields
of
lower
rates
of
shear
,
so
the
statement
should
be
modified
by
stating
that
the
mechanics
are
similar
.
If
the
mechanics
are
similar
,
we
can
also
infer
that
the
thermodynamics
will
also
be
similar
.
The
concept
of
the
strain
energy
as
a
Gibbs
function
difference
Af
and
exerting
a
force
normal
to
the
shearing
face
is
compatible
with
the
information
obtained
from
optical
birefringence
studies
of
fluids
undergoing
shear
.
Essentially
these
birefringence
studies
show
that
at
low
rates
of
shear
a
tension
is
present
at
45-degrees
to
the
direction
of
shear
,
and
as
the
rate
of
shear
increases
,
the
direction
of
the
maximum
tension
moves
asymptotically
toward
the
direction
of
shear
.
According
to
Philippoff
,
the
recoverable
shear
S
is
given
by
Af
where
**yc
is
the
angle
of
extinction
.
From
this
and
the
force
of
deformation
it
should
be
possible
to
calculate
the
elastic
energy
of
deformation
which
should
be
equal
to
the
Af
calculated
from
the
pressure
normal
to
the
shearing
face
.
There
is
another
means
which
should
show
the
direction
and
relative
value
of
the
stresses
in
viscoelastic
fluids
that
is
not
mentioned
as
such
in
the
literature
,
and
that
is
the
shape
of
the
suspended
drops
of
low
viscosity
fluids
in
shear
fields
.
These
droplets
are
distorted
by
the
normal
forces
just
as
a
balloon
would
be
pulled
or
pressed
out
of
shape
in
one's
hands
.
These
droplets
appear
to
be
ellipsoids
,
and
it
is
mathematically
convenient
to
assume
that
they
are
.
If
they
are
not
ellipsoids
,
the
conclusions
will
be
a
reasonable
approximation
.
The
direction
of
the
tension
of
minimum
pressure
is
,
of
course
,
given
by
the
direction
of
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
.
Mason
and
Taylor
both
show
that
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
is
at
45-degrees
at
low
rates
of
shear
and
that
it
approaches
the
direction
of
shear
with
increased
rates
of
shear
.
(
Some
suspensions
break
up
before
they
are
near
to
the
direction
of
shear
,
and
some
become
asymptotic
to
it
without
breakup
.
)
This
is
,
of
course
,
a
similar
type
of
behavior
to
that
indicated
by
birefringence
studies
.
The
relative
forces
can
be
calculated
from
the
various
radii
of
curvature
if
we
assume
:
(
A
)
The
surface
tension
is
uniform
on
the
surface
of
the
drop
.
(
B
)
That
because
of
the
low
viscosity
of
the
fluid
,
the
internal
pressure
is
the
same
in
all
directions
.
(
C
)
The
kinetic
effects
are
negligible
.
(
D
)
Since
the
shape
of
the
drop
conforms
to
the
force
field
,
it
does
not
appreciably
affect
the
distribution
of
forces
in
the
fluid
.
These
are
reasonable
assumptions
with
low
viscosity
fluids
suspended
in
high
viscosity
fluids
which
are
subjected
to
low
rates
of
shear
.
Just
as
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface
tension
in
a
spherical
drop
is
Af
and
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface
tension
on
a
cylindrical
shape
is
Af
,
the
pressure
exerted
by
any
curved
surface
is
Af
,
where
**yg
is
the
interfacial
tension
and
Af
and
Af
are
the
two
radii
of
curvature
.
This
formula
is
given
by
Rumscheidt
and
Mason
.
If
A
is
the
major
axis
of
an
ellipsoid
and
B
and
C
are
the
other
two
axes
,
the
radius
of
curvature
in
the
ab
plane
at
the
end
of
the
axis
Af
,
and
the
difference
in
pressure
along
the
A
and
B
axes
is
Af
.
There
are
no
data
published
in
the
literature
on
the
shape
of
low
viscosity
drops
to
confirm
the
above
formulas
.
However
,
there
are
photographs
of
suspended
drops
of
cyclohexanol
phthalate
(
viscosity
155
poises
)
suspended
in
corn
syrup
of
71
poises
in
a
paper
by
Mason
and
Bartok
.
This
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
is
,
of
course
,
not
negligible
.
Measurements
on
the
photograph
in
this
paper
give
Af
at
the
maximum
rate
of
shear
of
Af
.
If
it
is
assumed
that
the
formula
given
by
Lodge
of
cosec
Af
applies
,
the
pressure
difference
along
the
major
axes
can
be
calculated
from
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
major
axis
,
and
from
this
the
interfacial
tension
can
be
calculated
.
Its
value
was
Af
from
the
above
data
.
This
appears
to
be
high
,
as
would
be
expected
from
the
appreciable
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
.
It
is
appropriate
to
call
attention
to
certain
thermodynamic
properties
of
an
ideal
gas
that
are
analogous
to
rubber-like
deformation
.
The
internal
energy
of
an
ideal
gas
depends
on
temperature
only
and
is
independent
of
pressure
or
volume
.
In
other
words
,
if
an
ideal
gas
is
compressed
and
kept
at
constant
temperature
,
the
work
done
in
compressing
it
is
completely
converted
into
heat
and
transferred
to
the
surrounding
heat
sink
.
This
means
that
work
equals
Q
which
in
turn
equals
Af
.
There
is
a
well-known
relationship
between
probability
and
entropy
which
states
that
Af
,
where
**zq
is
the
probability
that
state
(
i.e.
,
volume
for
an
ideal
gas
)
could
be
reached
by
chance
alone
.
This
is
known
as
conformational
entropy
.
This
conformational
entropy
is
,
in
this
case
,
equal
to
the
usual
entropy
,
for
there
are
no
other
changes
or
other
energies
involved
.
Note
that
though
the
ideal
gas
itself
contains
no
additional
energy
,
the
compressed
gas
does
exert
an
increased
pressure
.
The
energy
for
any
isothermal
work
done
by
the
perfect
gas
must
come
as
thermal
energy
from
its
surroundings
.
A
proton
magnetic
resonance
study
of
polycrystalline
Af
as
a
function
of
magnetic
field
and
temperature
is
presented
.
Af
is
paramagnetic
,
and
electron
paramagnetic
dipole
as
well
as
nuclear
dipole
effects
lead
to
line
broadening
.
The
lines
are
asymmetric
and
over
the
range
of
field
Af
gauss
and
temperature
Af
the
asymmetry
increases
with
increasing
Af
and
decreasing
T
.
An
isotropic
resonance
shift
of
Af
to
lower
applied
fields
indicates
a
weak
isotropic
hyperfine
contact
interaction
.
The
general
theory
of
resonance
shifts
is
used
to
derive
a
general
expression
for
the
second
moment
Af
of
a
polycrystalline
paramagnetic
sample
and
is
specialized
to
Af
.
The
theory
predicts
a
linear
dependence
of
Af
on
Af
,
where
J
is
the
experimentally
determined
Curie-Weiss
constant
.
The
experimental
second
moment
Af
conforms
to
the
relation
Af
in
agreement
with
theory
.
Hence
,
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
(
slope
)
can
be
separated
from
the
nuclear
effects
(
intercept
)
.
The
paramagnetic
dipole
effects
provide
some
information
on
the
particle
shapes
.
The
nuclear
dipole
effects
provide
some
information
on
the
motions
of
the
hydrogen
nuclei
,
but
the
symmetry
of
the
Af
bond
in
Af
remains
in
doubt
.
Introduction
the
magnetic
moment
of
an
unpaired
electron
associated
nearby
may
have
a
tremendous
influence
on
the
magnetic
resonance
properties
of
nuclei
.
It
is
important
to
consider
and
experimentally
verify
this
influence
since
quantitative
nuclear
resonance
is
becoming
increasingly
used
in
investigations
of
structure
.
Af
appeared
to
be
well
suited
for
the
study
of
these
matters
,
since
it
is
a
normal
paramagnet
,
with
three
unpaired
electrons
on
the
chromium
,
its
crystal
structure
is
very
simple
,
and
the
unknown
position
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
strong
Af
bond
provides
structural
interest
.
We
first
discuss
the
Af
bond
in
Af
.
We
then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with
nuclei
and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
.
Indeed
it
is
possible
to
separate
electron
paramagnetic
from
nuclear
effects
.
The
information
provided
by
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
is
then
discussed
,
and
finally
the
nuclear
effects
are
interpreted
in
terms
of
various
motional-modified
models
of
the
Af
bond
in
Af
.
Af
bond
in
Af
Theoretical
studies
of
the
hydrogen
bond
generally
agree
that
the
Af
bond
will
be
linear
in
the
absence
of
peculiarities
of
packing
in
the
solid
.
Moreover
,
it
will
be
asymmetric
until
a
certain
critical
Af
distance
is
reached
,
below
which
it
will
become
symmetric
.
There
is
ample
evidence
from
many
sources
that
the
Af
bond
in
Af
is
symmetric
.
The
Af
distance
in
Af
is
2.26
Aj
.
There
is
evidence
,
though
less
convincing
than
for
Af
,
that
the
Af
bond
in
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
is
symmetric
.
Here
the
Af
distance
is
2.44
Aj
.
A
number
of
semiempirical
estimates
by
various
workers
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
Af
bond
becomes
symmetric
when
the
Af
bond
length
is
about
2.4
to
2.5
A
,
but
aside
from
the
possible
example
of
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
there
have
been
no
convincing
reports
of
symmetric
Af
bonds
.
Douglass
has
studied
the
crystal
structure
of
Af
by
x-ray
diffraction
.
He
finds
the
structure
contains
an
Af
bond
with
the
Af
distance
of
Af
.
There
is
,
then
,
the
possibility
that
this
Af
bond
is
symmetric
,
although
Douglass
was
unable
to
determine
its
symmetry
from
his
x-ray
data
.
Douglass
found
Af
to
be
trigonal
,
Laue
symmetry
Af
,
with
Af
,
Af
.
X-ray
and
experimental
density
showed
one
formula
unit
in
the
unit
cell
,
corresponding
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
Af
.
The
x-ray
data
did
not
permit
Douglass
to
determine
uniquely
the
space
group
,
but
a
negative
test
for
piezoelectricity
led
him
to
assume
a
center
of
symmetry
.
Under
this
assumption
the
space
group
must
be
Af
and
the
following
are
the
positions
of
the
atoms
in
the
unit
cell
.
Af
.
This
space
group
requires
the
hydrogen
bond
to
be
symmetric
.
Douglass
found
powder
intensity
calculations
and
measurements
to
agree
best
for
Af
.
These
data
lead
to
a
structure
in
which
sheets
of
Cr
atoms
lie
between
two
sheets
of
O
atoms
.
The
O
atoms
in
each
sheet
are
close
packed
and
each
Cr
atom
is
surrounded
by
a
distorted
octahedron
of
O
atoms
.
The
Af
layers
are
stacked
normal
to
the
(
111
)
axis
with
the
lower
oxygens
of
one
layer
directly
above
the
upper
oxygens
of
the
neighboring
lower
layer
,
in
such
a
manner
that
the
repeat
is
every
three
layers
.
The
separate
layers
are
joined
together
by
hydrogen
bonds
.
A
drawing
of
the
structure
is
to
be
found
in
reference
6
.
The
gross
details
of
the
structure
appear
reasonable
.
The
structure
appears
to
be
unique
among
OOH
compounds
,
but
is
the
same
as
that
assumed
by
Af
.
The
bond
angles
and
distances
are
all
within
the
expected
limits
and
the
volume
per
oxygen
is
about
normal
.
However
,
the
possible
absence
of
a
center
of
symmetry
not
only
moves
the
hydrogen
atom
off
Af
,
but
also
allows
the
oxygen
atoms
to
become
nonequivalent
,
with
Af
at
Af
and
Af
at
Af
(
space
group
Af
)
,
where
Af
represents
the
oxygens
on
one
side
of
the
Af
layers
and
Af
those
on
the
other
side
.
However
,
any
oxygen
nonequivalence
would
shorten
either
the
already
extremely
short
Af
interlayer
distance
of
2.55
A
or
the
non-hydrogen-bonded
Af
interlayer
interactions
which
are
already
quite
short
at
2.58
Aj
.
Hence
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
packing
of
the
atoms
in
this
material
in
which
the
oxygen
atoms
are
far
from
geometrical
equivalence
.
The
only
effect
of
lack
of
a
center
would
then
be
to
release
the
hydrogen
atoms
to
occupy
general
,
rather
than
special
,
positions
along
the
(
111
)
axis
.
If
the
Af
bond
is
linear
then
there
are
three
reasonable
positions
for
the
hydrogen
atoms
:
(
1
)
The
hydrogen
atoms
are
centered
and
hence
all
lie
on
a
sheet
midway
between
the
oxygen
sheets
;
;
(
2
)
all
hydrogen
atoms
lie
on
a
sheet
,
but
the
sheet
is
closer
to
one
oxygen
sheet
than
to
the
other
;
;
(
3
)
hydrogen
atoms
are
asymmetrically
placed
,
either
randomly
or
in
an
ordered
way
,
so
that
some
hydrogen
atoms
are
closer
to
the
upper
oxygen
atoms
while
others
are
closer
to
the
lower
oxygen
atoms
.
Position
(
2
)
appears
to
us
to
be
unlikely
in
view
of
the
absence
of
a
piezoelectric
effect
and
on
general
chemical
structural
grounds
.
A
randomization
of
``
ups
''
and
``
downs
''
is
more
likely
than
ordered
``
ups
''
and
``
downs
''
in
position
(
3
)
since
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
well
separated
and
so
the
position
of
one
could
hardly
affect
the
position
of
another
,
and
also
since
ordered
``
up
''
and
``
down
''
implies
a
larger
unit
cell
,
for
which
no
evidence
exists
.
Therefore
,
the
only
unknown
structural
feature
would
appear
to
be
whether
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
located
symmetrically
(
1
)
or
asymmetrically
(
3
)
.
Experimental
procedures
samples
Douglass
prepared
his
sample
of
Af
by
thermal
decomposition
of
aqueous
chromic
acid
at
300
-
325-degrees-C
.
Dr.
Douglass
was
kind
enough
to
lend
us
about
5
grams
of
his
material
.
This
material
proved
to
be
unsatisfactory
,
since
we
could
not
obtain
reproducible
results
on
various
portions
of
the
sample
.
Subsequently
,
we
learned
from
Douglass
that
his
sample
contained
a
few
percent
Af
impurity
.
Since
Af
is
ferromagnetic
,
we
felt
that
any
results
obtained
from
the
magnetically
contaminated
Af
would
be
suspect
.
Plane
suggested
another
preparation
of
Af
which
we
used
here
.
500
ml
of
1M
aqueous
Af
with
1
Af
added
are
heated
in
a
bomb
at
170-degrees-C
for
48
hours
.
A
very
fine
,
gray
solid
(
about
15
g
)
is
formed
,
water-washed
by
centrifugation
,
and
dried
at
110-degrees-C
)
.
Differential
thermal
analysis
showed
a
very
small
endothermic
reaction
at
340-degrees-C
and
a
large
endothermic
reaction
at
470-degrees-C
.
This
latter
reaction
is
in
accord
with
the
reported
decomposition
of
Af
.
Thermogravimetric
analysis
showed
a
weight
loss
of
1.8%
centered
at
337-degrees-C
and
another
weight
loss
of
10.8%
at
463-degrees-C
.
The
expected
weight
loss
for
Af
going
to
Af
and
Af
is
10.6%
.
Mass
spectrometric
analysis
of
gases
evolved
upon
heating
to
410-degrees-C
indicated
nitrogen
oxides
and
water
vapor
.
The
small
reaction
occurring
at
337-degrees-C
is
probably
caused
by
decomposition
of
occluded
nitrates
,
and
perhaps
by
a
small
amount
of
some
hydrous
material
other
than
Af
.
All
subsequent
measurements
were
made
on
material
which
had
been
heated
to
375-degrees-C
for
one
hour
.
Emission
spectra
indicated
Af
calcium
and
all
other
impurities
much
lower
.
Chromium
analysis
gave
58.8%
Cr
as
compared
with
61.2%
theory
.
However
,
Af
adsorbs
water
from
the
atmosphere
and
this
may
account
for
the
low
chromium
analysis
and
high
total
weight
loss
.
The
x-ray
diffraction
pattern
of
the
material
,
taken
with
CuK**ya
radiation
,
indicated
the
presence
of
no
extra
lines
and
was
in
good
agreement
with
the
pattern
of
Douglass
.
Magnetic
analyses
by
R.
G.
Meisenheimer
of
this
laboratory
indicated
no
ferromagnetic
impurities
.
Af
was
found
to
be
paramagnetic
with
three
unpaired
electrons
per
chromium
atom
and
a
molecular
susceptibility
of
Af
,
where
Af
.
For
exactly
three
unpaired
electrons
the
coefficient
would
be
3.10
.
An
infrared
spectrum
,
obtained
by
H.
A.
Benesi
and
R.
G.
Snyder
of
this
laboratory
,
showed
bands
in
the
positions
found
by
Jones
.
Electron
microscopic
examination
of
the
Af
sample
showed
it
to
be
composed
of
nearly
isotropic
particles
about
0.3M
in
diameter
.
The
particles
appeared
rough
and
undoubtedly
the
single-crystal
domains
are
smaller
than
this
.
The
x-ray
data
are
consistent
with
particle
sizes
of
1000
A
or
greater
.
We
found
no
obvious
effects
due
to
preferred
orientation
of
the
crystallites
in
this
sample
nor
would
we
expect
to
on
the
basis
of
the
shape
found
from
electron
microscopic
examination
.
Nuclear
magnetic
resonance
(
NMR
)
measurements
The
magnetic
resonance
absorption
was
detected
by
employing
a
Varian
model
Af
broad
line
spectrometer
and
the
associated
12-inch
electromagnet
system
.
One
measurement
at
40
Mc/sec
was
obtained
with
the
Varian
model
Af
unit
.
A
bridged-T
type
of
bridge
was
used
in
the
10
-
16
Mc/sec
range
.
The
rf
power
level
was
maintained
small
enough
at
all
times
to
prevent
obvious
line
shape
distortions
by
saturation
effects
.
A
modulation
frequency
of
40
cps
with
an
amplitude
as
small
as
possible
,
commensurate
with
reasonably
good
signal-to-noise
quality
,
was
used
.
Background
spectra
were
obtained
in
all
cases
.
The
spectrometer
was
adjusted
to
minimize
the
amount
of
dispersion
mode
mixed
in
with
the
absorption
signal
.
A
single
value
of
the
thermal
relaxation
time
Af
at
room
temperature
was
measured
by
the
progressive
saturation
method
.
The
value
of
Af
estimated
at
470
gauss
was
Af
microseconds
.
A
single
measurement
of
the
spin
-
spin
relaxation
time
Af
was
obtained
at
10
Mc/sec
by
pulse
methods
.
This
measurement
was
obtained
by
W.
Blumberg
of
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
,
by
observing
the
breadth
of
the
free
induction
decay
signal
.
The
value
derived
was
16
microseconds
.
Field
shifts
were
derived
from
the
mean
value
of
the
resonance
line
,
defined
as
the
field
about
which
the
first
moment
is
zero
.
Second
moments
of
the
spectra
were
computed
by
numerical
integration
.
Corrections
were
applied
for
modulation
broadening
,
apparatus
background
,
and
field
shift
.
Spectra
were
obtained
over
the
temperature
range
of
77
-
294-degrees-K
.
For
the
low-temperature
measurements
the
sample
was
cooled
by
a
cold
nitrogen
gas
flow
method
similar
to
that
of
Andrew
and
Eades
.
The
temperature
was
maintained
to
within
about
Af
for
the
period
of
time
required
to
make
the
measurement
(
usually
about
one
hour
)
.
One
sample
,
which
had
been
exposed
to
the
atmosphere
after
evacuation
at
375-degrees-C
,
showed
the
presence
of
adsorbed
water
(
about
0.3
wt
)
)
as
evidenced
by
a
weak
resonance
line
which
was
very
narrow
at
room
temperature
and
which
disappeared
,
due
to
broadening
,
at
low
temperature
.
The
data
reported
here
are
either
from
spectra
from
which
the
adsorbed
water
resonance
could
easily
be
eliminated
or
from
spectra
of
samples
evacuated
and
sealed
off
at
375-degrees-C
which
contain
no
adsorbed
water
.
The
measured
powder
density
of
the
Af
used
here
was
about
Af
,
approximately
one-third
that
of
the
crystal
density
(
Af
)
.
Such
a
density
corresponds
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
about
Af
.
Spectra
were
obtained
from
a
powdered
sample
having
the
shape
of
a
right
circular
cylinder
with
a
height-to-diameter
ratio
of
4
:
:
1
.
The
top
of
the
sample
was
nearly
flat
and
the
bottom
hemispherical
.
Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
sample
in
a
spherical
container
which
was
made
by
blowing
a
bubble
on
the
end
of
a
capillary
glass
tube
.
The
bubble
was
filled
to
the
top
and
special
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
any
sample
from
remaining
in
the
capillary
.
Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
third
sample
of
Af
which
had
been
diluted
to
three
times
its
original
volume
with
powdered
,
anhydrous
alundum
(
Af
)
.
This
sample
was
contained
in
a
cylindrical
container
similar
to
that
described
above
.
Polyphosphates
gave
renewed
life
to
soap
products
at
a
time
when
surfactants
were
a
threat
though
expensive
,
and
these
same
polyphosphates
spelled
the
decline
of
soap
usage
when
the
synergism
between
polyphosphates
and
synthetic
detergent
actives
was
recognized
and
exploited
.
The
market
today
for
detergent
builders
is
quite
diverse
.
The
best
known
field
of
application
for
builders
is
in
heavy-duty
,
spray-dried
detergent
formulations
for
household
use
.
These
widely
advertised
products
,
which
are
used
primarily
for
washing
clothes
,
are
based
on
high-sudsing
,
synthetic
organic
actives
(
sodium
alkylbenzenesulfonates
)
and
contain
up
to
50%
by
weight
of
sodium
tripolyphosphate
or
a
mixture
of
sodium
tripolyphosphate
and
tetrasodium
pyrophosphate
.
In
the
household
market
,
there
are
also
low-sudsing
detergent
formulations
based
on
nonionic
actives
with
about
the
same
amount
of
phosphate
builder
;
;
light-duty
synthetic
detergents
with
much
less
builder
;
;
and
the
dwindling
built-soap
powders
as
well
as
soap
flakes
and
granules
,
none
of
which
are
now
nationally
advertised
.
A
well-publicized
entrant
which
has
achieved
success
only
recently
is
the
built
liquid
detergent
,
with
which
the
major
problem
today
is
incorporation
of
builder
and
active
into
a
small
volume
using
a
sufficiently
high
builder/active
ratio
.
Hard-surface
cleaning
in
household
application
is
represented
by
two
classes
of
alkaline
products
:
(
1
)
the
formulations
made
expressly
for
machine
dishwashers
,
and
(
2
)
the
general-purpose
cleaners
used
for
walls
and
woodwork
.
The
better
quality
products
in
both
of
these
lines
contain
phosphate
builders
.
In
addition
,
many
of
the
hard-surface
cleaners
used
for
walls
and
woodwork
had
their
genesis
in
trisodium
orthophosphate
,
which
is
still
the
major
ingredient
of
a
number
of
such
products
.
Many
scouring
powders
now
also
contain
phosphates
.
These
hard-surface
cleaners
are
discussed
in
Chapter
28
.
The
cleaning
process
Cleaning
or
detergent
action
is
entirely
a
matter
of
surfaces
.
Wet
cleaning
involves
an
aqueous
medium
,
a
solid
substrate
,
soil
to
be
removed
,
and
the
detergent
or
surface-active
material
.
An
oversimplified
differentiation
between
soft-
and
hard-surface
cleaning
lies
in
the
magnitude
and
kind
of
surface
involved
.
One
gram
of
cotton
has
been
found
to
have
a
specific
surface
area
of
Af
.
In
contrast
,
a
metal
coupon
Af
in
size
would
have
a
magnitude
from
100,000
to
a
million
less
.
Even
here
there
is
room
for
some
variation
,
for
metal
surfaces
vary
in
smoothness
,
absorptive
capacity
,
and
chemical
reactivity
.
Spring
used
a
Brush
surface-analyzer
in
a
metal-cleaning
study
and
showed
considerable
differences
in
soil
removal
,
depending
upon
surface
roughness
.
There
are
considerable
differences
between
the
requirements
for
textile
and
hard-surface
cleaning
.
Exclusive
of
esthetic
values
,
such
as
high-
or
low-foam
level
,
perfume
content
,
etc.
,
the
requirements
for
the
organic
active
used
in
washing
textiles
are
high
.
No
matter
how
they
are
formulated
,
a
large
number
of
organic
actives
are
simply
not
suitable
for
this
application
,
since
they
do
not
give
adequate
soil
removal
.
This
is
best
demonstrated
by
practical
washing
tests
in
which
cloth
articles
are
repeatedly
washed
with
the
same
detergent
formulation
.
A
good
formulation
will
keep
the
clothes
clean
and
white
after
many
washings
;
;
whereas
,
with
a
poor
formulation
,
the
clothes
exhibit
a
build-up
of
``
tattle-tale
grey
''
and
dirty
spots
--
sometimes
with
bad
results
even
after
the
first
wash
.
Since
practical
washing
procedures
are
both
lengthy
and
expensive
,
a
number
of
laboratory
tests
have
been
developed
for
the
numerical
evaluation
of
detergents
.
Harris
has
indicated
that
two
devices
,
the
Launder-Ometer
and
Terg-O-Tometer
are
most
widely
used
for
rapid
detergent
testing
,
and
he
has
listed
the
commercially
available
standard
soiled
fabrics
.
Also
given
are
several
laboratory
wash
procedures
in
general
use
.
The
soiled
fabrics
used
for
rapid
testing
of
detergent
formulations
are
made
in
such
a
way
that
only
part
of
the
soil
is
removed
by
even
the
best
detergent
formulation
in
a
single
wash
.
In
this
way
,
numerical
values
for
the
relative
efficacy
of
various
detergent
formulations
can
be
obtained
by
measuring
the
reflectance
(
whiteness
)
of
the
cloth
swatches
before
and
after
washing
.
Soil
redeposition
is
evaluated
by
washing
clean
swatches
with
the
dirty
ones
.
As
is
the
case
with
the
surface-active
agent
,
the
requirements
for
builders
to
be
used
in
detergent
compositions
for
washing
textiles
are
also
high
.
Large
numbers
of
potential
builders
have
been
investigated
,
but
none
have
been
found
to
be
as
effective
as
the
polyphosphates
over
the
relatively
wide
range
of
conditions
met
in
practice
.
The
problems
of
hard-surface
cleaning
are
not
nearly
as
complex
.
In
hard-surface
cleaning
,
the
inorganic
salts
are
more
important
than
the
organic
active
.
Indeed
,
when
the
proper
inorganic
constituents
are
employed
,
practically
any
wetting
or
surface-active
agent
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
when
present
in
sufficient
amount
in
a
hard-surface
cleaning
formulation
.
Hydroxides
,
orthophosphates
,
borates
,
carbonates
,
and
silicates
are
important
inorganic
ingredients
of
hard-surface
cleaners
.
In
addition
,
the
polyphosphates
are
also
used
,
probably
acting
more
as
peptizing
agents
than
anything
else
.
The
importance
of
the
inorganic
constituents
in
hard-surface
cleaning
has
been
emphasized
in
a
number
of
papers
.
Physical
chemistry
of
washing
Although
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
process
of
washing
fabrics
involves
a
number
of
phenomena
which
are
related
together
in
an
extremely
complicated
way
and
that
these
phenomena
and
their
interrelations
are
not
well
understood
at
the
present
,
this
section
attempts
to
present
briefly
an
up-to-date
picture
of
the
physical
chemistry
of
washing
either
fabrics
or
hard
surfaces
.
The
purpose
of
washing
is
,
obviously
,
to
remove
soils
which
are
arbitrarily
classed
in
the
four
major
categories
given
below
:
1
.
Dirt
,
which
is
here
defined
as
particulate
material
which
is
usually
inorganic
and
is
very
often
extremely
finely
divided
so
as
to
exhibit
colloidal
properties
.
2
.
Greasy
soils
,
which
are
typified
by
hydrocarbons
and
fats
(
esters
of
glycerol
with
long-chain
organic
acids
)
.
3
.
Stains
,
which
include
the
wide
variety
of
nonparticulate
materials
which
give
color
even
when
present
in
very
low
concentration
on
the
soiled
object
.
4
.
Miscellaneous
soils
,
which
primarily
include
sticky
substances
and
colorless
liquids
which
evaporate
to
leave
a
residue
.
The
dirt
on
the
soiled
objects
is
mechanically
held
by
surface
irregularities
to
some
extent
.
However
,
a
major
factor
in
binding
dirt
is
the
attraction
between
surfaces
that
goes
under
the
name
of
Van
der
Waal's
forces
.
This
is
a
theoretically
complicated
dipole
interaction
which
causes
any
extremely
small
uncharged
particle
to
agglomerate
with
other
small
uncharged
particles
,
or
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
.
Obviously
,
if
colloidal
particles
bear
charges
of
opposite
sign
or
,
if
one
kind
is
charged
and
the
other
kind
is
not
,
the
attraction
will
be
intensified
and
the
tendency
to
agglomerate
will
be
greatly
reinforced
.
Likewise
,
a
charged
particle
will
tend
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
and
vice
versa
,
and
a
charged
particle
will
be
very
strongly
attracted
to
a
surface
exhibiting
an
opposite
charge
.
In
addition
,
dirt
particles
can
be
held
onto
a
soiled
surface
by
sticky
substances
or
by
the
surface
tension
of
liquids
,
including
liquid
greases
.
Greases
,
stains
,
and
miscellaneous
soils
are
usually
sorbed
onto
the
soiled
surface
.
In
most
cases
,
these
soils
are
taken
up
as
liquids
through
capillary
action
.
In
an
essentially
static
system
,
an
oil
cannot
be
replaced
by
water
on
a
surface
unless
the
interfacial
tensions
of
the
water
phase
are
reduced
by
a
surface-active
agent
.
The
washing
process
whereby
soils
are
removed
consists
basically
of
applying
mechanical
action
to
loosen
the
dirt
particles
and
dried
matter
in
the
presence
of
water
which
helps
to
float
off
the
debris
and
acts
,
to
some
extent
,
as
a
dissolving
and
solvating
agent
.
Greasy
soils
are
hardly
removed
by
washing
in
plain
water
;
;
and
natural
waters
,
in
addition
,
often
contain
impurities
such
as
calcium
salts
which
can
react
with
soils
to
make
them
more
difficult
to
remove
.
Therefore
,
detergents
are
used
.
The
detergent
active
is
that
substance
which
primarily
acts
to
remove
greasy
soils
.
The
other
constituents
in
a
built
detergent
assist
in
this
and
in
the
removal
of
dirty
stains
and
the
hydrophilic
sticky
or
dried
soils
.
As
is
well
known
,
detergent
actives
belong
to
the
chemical
class
consisting
of
moderately
high
molecular
weight
and
highly
polar
molecules
which
exhibit
the
property
of
forming
micelles
in
solution
.
Physicochemical
investigations
of
anionic
surfactants
,
including
the
soaps
,
have
shown
that
there
is
little
polymerization
or
agglomeration
of
the
chain
anions
below
a
certain
region
of
concentration
called
the
critical
micelle
concentration
.
(
1
)
Below
the
critical
micelle
concentration
,
monomers
and
some
dimers
are
present
.
(
2
)
In
the
critical
micelle
region
,
there
is
a
rapid
agglomeration
or
polymerization
to
give
the
micelles
,
which
have
a
degree
of
polymerization
averaging
around
60
-
80
.
(
3
)
For
anionics
,
these
micelles
appear
to
be
roughly
spherical
assemblages
in
which
the
hydrocarbon
tails
come
together
so
that
the
polar
groups
(
the
ionized
ends
)
face
outward
towards
the
aqueous
continuous
phase
.
Obviously
hydrophobic
(
oleophilic
)
substances
such
as
greases
,
oils
,
or
particles
having
a
greasy
or
oily
surface
are
more
at
home
in
the
center
of
a
micelle
than
in
the
aqueous
phase
.
Micelles
can
imbibe
and
hold
a
considerable
amount
of
oleophilic
substances
so
that
the
micelle
volume
may
be
increased
as
much
as
approximately
two-fold
.
Although
the
matter
has
not
been
unequivocally
demonstrated
,
the
available
data
show
that
micelles
in
themselves
do
not
contribute
significantly
to
the
detergency
process
.
Related
to
micelle
formation
is
the
technologically
important
ability
of
detergent
actives
to
congregate
at
oil
-
water
interfaces
in
such
a
manner
that
the
polar
(
or
ionized
)
end
of
the
molecule
is
directed
towards
the
aqueous
phase
and
the
hydrocarbon
chain
towards
the
oily
phase
.
In
the
cleaning
process
,
sorbed
greasy
soils
become
coated
in
this
manner
with
an
oriented
film
of
surfactant
.
Then
during
washing
,
the
greasy
soil
rolls
back
at
the
edges
so
that
emulsified
droplets
can
disengage
themselves
from
the
sorbed
oil
mass
,
with
the
aid
of
mechanical
action
,
and
enter
the
aqueous
phase
.
Obviously
,
a
substance
which
is
permanently
or
temporarily
sorbed
on
the
surface
in
place
of
the
soil
will
tend
to
accelerate
this
process
and
effectively
push
off
the
greasy
soil
.
Substances
other
than
detergent
actives
also
tend
to
be
strongly
sorbed
from
aqueous
media
onto
surfaces
of
other
contiguous
condensed
phases
.
This
is
particularly
true
of
highly
charged
ions
,
especially
those
ions
which
fall
into
the
class
of
polyelectrolytes
.
Whereas
the
usual
organic
surface-active
agent
is
strongly
sorbed
at
oil
-
water
interfaces
,
the
highly
charged
ions
are
most
strongly
sorbed
at
interfaces
between
water
and
insoluble
materials
exhibiting
an
ionic
structure
(
see
Table
26-2
on
p.
1678
)
.
Thus
,
for
aqueous
media
,
we
can
think
of
the
idealized
organic
active
as
an
oleophilic
or
hydrophobic
surface-active
agent
,
and
of
an
idealized
builder
as
a
oleophobic
or
hydrophilic
surface-active
agent
.
From
the
equilibrium
sorption
data
which
are
available
,
it
seems
logical
to
expect
that
polyphosphate
ions
would
be
strongly
sorbed
on
the
surface
of
the
dirt
(
especially
clay
soils
)
so
as
to
give
it
a
greatly
increased
negative
charge
.
The
charged
particles
then
repel
each
other
and
are
also
repelled
from
the
charged
surface
,
which
almost
invariably
bears
a
negative
charge
under
washing
conditions
.
The
negatively
charged
dirt
particles
then
leave
the
surface
and
go
into
the
aqueous
phase
.
This
hypothesis
is
evolved
in
analogy
to
the
demonstrated
action
of
organic
actives
in
detergency
.
It
does
not
consider
the
kinetic
effects
of
the
phosphate
builders
on
sorption-desorption
phenomena
which
will
be
discussed
later
(
see
pp.
1746
-
1748
)
.
The
crude
picture
of
the
detergency
process
thus
far
developed
can
be
represented
as
:
Af
.
The
influence
of
mechanical
action
on
the
particles
of
free
soil
may
be
compared
to
that
of
kinetic
energy
on
a
molecular
scale
.
Freed
soil
must
be
dispersed
and
protected
against
flocculation
.
Cleaned
cloth
must
be
protected
against
the
redeposition
of
dispersed
soil
.
It
is
evident
that
the
requirements
imposed
by
these
effects
upon
any
one
detergent
constituent
acting
alone
are
severe
.
Upon
consideration
of
the
variety
of
soils
and
fabrics
normally
encountered
in
the
washing
process
,
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
use
of
a
number
of
detergent
constituents
having
``
synergistic
''
properties
has
gained
widespread
acceptance
.
In
the
over-all
process
,
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
``
pure
''
role
to
each
constituent
of
a
built-detergent
formulation
;
;
and
,
indeed
,
there
is
no
more
reason
to
separate
the
interrelated
roles
of
the
active
,
builder
,
antiredeposition
agent
,
etc.
than
there
is
to
assign
individual
actions
to
each
of
the
numerous
isomers
making
up
a
given
commercial
organic
active
.
The
thermal
exchange
of
chlorine
between
Af
and
liquid
Af
is
readily
measurable
at
temperatures
in
the
range
of
180-degrees
and
above
.
The
photochemical
exchange
occurs
with
a
quantum
yield
of
the
order
of
unity
in
the
liquid
phase
at
65-degrees
using
light
absorbed
only
by
the
Af
.
In
the
gas
phase
,
with
Af
of
Af
and
Af
of
Af
,
quantum
yields
of
the
order
of
Af
have
been
observed
at
85-degrees
.
Despite
extensive
attempts
to
obtain
highly
pure
reagents
,
serious
difficulty
was
experienced
in
obtaining
reproducible
rates
of
reaction
.
It
appears
possible
to
set
a
lower
limit
of
about
Af
for
the
activation
energy
of
the
abstraction
of
a
chlorine
atom
from
a
carbon
tetrachloride
molecule
by
a
chlorine
atom
to
form
Af
radical
.
The
rate
of
the
gas
phase
exchange
reaction
appears
to
be
proportional
to
the
first
power
of
the
absorbed
light
intensity
indicating
that
the
radical
intermediates
are
removed
at
the
walls
or
by
reaction
with
an
impurity
rather
than
by
bimolecular
radical
combination
reactions
.
Introduction
Because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
molecules
,
isotopic
exchange
reactions
between
elemental
halogens
and
the
corresponding
carbon
tetrahalides
would
appear
to
offer
particularly
fruitful
possibilities
for
obtaining
unambiguous
basic
kinetic
data
.
It
would
appear
that
it
should
be
possible
to
determine
unique
mechanisms
for
the
thermal
and
photochemical
reactions
in
both
the
liquid
and
gas
phases
and
to
determine
values
for
activation
energies
of
some
of
the
intermediate
reactions
of
atoms
and
free
radicals
,
as
well
as
information
on
the
heat
of
dissociation
of
the
carbon-halogen
bond
.
The
reaction
of
chlorine
with
carbon
tetrachloride
seemed
particularly
suited
for
such
studies
.
It
should
be
possible
to
prepare
very
pure
chlorine
by
oxidation
of
inorganic
chlorides
on
a
vacuum
system
followed
by
multiple
distillation
of
the
liquid
.
It
should
be
possible
to
free
carbon
tetrachloride
of
any
interfering
substances
by
the
usual
purification
methods
followed
by
prechlorination
prior
to
addition
of
radioactive
chlorine
.
Furthermore
,
the
exchange
would
not
be
expected
to
be
sensitive
to
trace
amounts
of
impurities
because
it
would
not
be
apt
to
be
a
chain
reaction
since
the
activation
energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
by
a
chlorine
atom
would
be
expected
to
be
too
high
;
;
also
it
would
be
expected
that
Af
would
compete
very
effectively
with
any
impurities
as
a
scavenger
for
Af
radicals
.
Contrary
to
these
expectations
we
have
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
the
degree
of
reproducibility
one
would
wish
,
even
with
extensive
efforts
to
prepare
especially
pure
reagents
.
We
are
reporting
these
investigations
here
briefly
because
of
their
relevancy
to
problems
of
the
study
of
apparently
simple
exchange
reactions
of
chlorine
and
because
the
results
furnish
some
information
on
the
activation
energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
atoms
from
carbon
tetrachloride
.
Experimental
reagents
.
--
Matheson
highest
purity
tank
chlorine
was
passed
through
a
tube
of
resublimed
Af
into
an
evacuated
Pyrex
system
where
it
was
condensed
with
liquid
air
.
It
was
then
distilled
at
least
three
times
from
a
trap
at
-78-degrees
to
a
liquid
air
trap
with
only
a
small
middle
fraction
being
retained
in
each
distillation
.
The
purified
product
was
stored
at
-78-degrees
in
a
tube
equipped
with
a
break
seal
.
Of
several
methods
employed
for
tagging
chlorine
with
radiochlorine
,
the
exchange
of
inactive
chlorine
with
tagged
aluminum
chloride
at
room
temperature
was
found
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
.
To
prepare
the
latter
,
silver
chloride
was
precipitated
from
a
solution
containing
Af
obtained
from
the
Oak
Ridge
National
Laboratory
.
The
silver
chloride
was
fused
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
aluminum
chips
with
the
resultant
product
of
Af
which
was
sublimed
into
a
flask
on
the
vacuum
line
.
Previously
purified
chlorine
was
subsequently
admitted
and
the
exchange
was
allowed
to
take
place
.
The
radiochlorine
was
stored
at
-78-degrees
in
a
tube
equipped
with
a
break
seal
.
Liter
quantities
of
Mallinckrodt
,
low
sulfur
,
reagent
grade
carbon
tetrachloride
were
saturated
with
Af
and
Af
and
illuminated
for
about
50
hours
with
a
1000
watt
tungsten
lamp
at
a
distance
of
a
few
inches
.
The
mixture
was
then
extracted
with
alkali
and
with
water
following
which
the
carbon
tetrachloride
was
distilled
on
a
Vigreux
column
,
a
25%
center
cut
being
retained
which
was
then
degassed
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
Af
.
Purified
inactive
chlorine
was
then
added
from
one
of
the
tubes
described
above
and
the
mixture
frozen
out
and
sealed
off
in
a
flask
equipped
with
a
break
seal
.
This
chlorine-carbon
tetrachloride
solution
was
illuminated
for
a
day
following
which
the
flask
was
resealed
onto
a
vacuum
system
and
the
excess
chlorine
distilled
off
.
The
required
amount
of
carbon
tetrachloride
was
distilled
into
a
series
of
reaction
cells
on
a
manifold
on
a
vacuum
line
.
The
desired
amounts
of
inactive
chlorine
and
radioactive
chlorine
were
likewise
condensed
in
these
cells
on
the
vacuum
line
following
which
they
were
frozen
down
and
the
manifold
as
a
whole
was
sealed
off
.
The
contents
of
the
manifold
for
liquid
phase
experiments
were
then
mixed
by
shaking
,
redistributed
to
the
reaction
tubes
,
frozen
down
,
and
each
tube
was
then
sealed
off
.
The
reactants
for
the
gas
phase
experiments
were
first
frozen
out
in
a
side-arm
attached
to
the
manifold
and
then
allowed
to
distil
slowly
into
the
manifold
of
pre-cooled
reaction
cells
before
sealing
off
.
This
method
in
general
solved
the
problem
of
obtaining
fairly
equal
concentrations
of
reactants
in
each
of
the
six
cells
from
a
set
.
Reaction
conditions
and
analysis
.
--
The
samples
for
liquid
phase
thermal
reaction
studies
were
prepared
in
Pyrex
capillary
tubing
2.5
mm.
i.d.
and
about
15
cm.
long
.
In
a
few
experiments
the
tubes
were
made
from
standard
6
mm.
i.d.
Pyrex
tubing
of
1
mm.
wall
thickness
.
Both
types
of
tube
withstood
the
pressure
of
approximately
20
atmospheres
exerted
by
the
carbon
tetrachloride
at
220-degrees
.
The
photochemical
reaction
cells
consisted
of
10
mm.
i.d.
Pyrex
tubing
,
5.5
cm.
long
,
diffraction
effects
being
minimized
by
the
fact
that
the
light
passed
through
only
liquid-glass
interfaces
and
not
gas-glass
interfaces
.
These
cells
were
used
rather
than
square
Pyrex
tubing
because
of
the
tendency
of
the
latter
to
shatter
when
thawing
frozen
carbon
tetrachloride
.
The
round
cells
were
reproducibly
positioned
in
the
light
beam
which
entered
the
thermostated
mineral
oil-bath
through
a
window
.
Two
types
of
light
source
were
used
,
a
thousand
watt
projection
lamp
and
an
AH6
high
pressure
mercury
arc
.
The
light
was
filtered
by
the
soft
glass
window
of
the
thermostat
thus
ensuring
that
only
light
absorbed
by
the
chlorine
and
not
by
the
carbon
tetrachloride
could
enter
the
reaction
cell
.
Relative
incident
light
intensities
were
measured
with
a
thermopile
potentiometer
system
.
Changes
of
intensity
on
the
cell
were
achieved
by
use
of
a
wire
screen
and
by
varying
the
distance
of
the
light
source
from
the
cell
.
Following
reaction
the
cells
were
scratched
with
a
file
and
opened
under
a
20%
aqueous
sodium
iodide
solution
.
Carrier
Af
was
added
and
the
aqueous
and
organic
phases
were
separated
(
cells
containing
gaseous
reactants
were
immersed
in
liquid
air
before
opening
under
sodium
iodide
)
.
After
titration
of
the
liberated
Af
with
Af
,
aliquots
of
the
aqueous
and
of
the
organic
phase
were
counted
in
a
solution-type
Geiger
tube
.
In
the
liquid
phase
runs
the
amount
of
carbon
tetrachloride
in
each
reaction
tube
was
determined
by
weighing
the
tube
before
opening
and
weighing
the
fragments
after
emptying
.
The
fraction
of
exchange
was
determined
as
the
ratio
of
the
counts
/
minute
observed
in
the
carbon
tetrachloride
to
the
counts
/
minute
calculated
for
the
carbon
tetrachloride
fractions
for
equilibrium
distribution
of
the
activity
between
the
chlorine
and
carbon
tetrachloride
,
empirically
determined
correction
being
made
for
the
difference
in
counting
efficiency
of
Af
in
Af
and
Af
.
Results
the
thermal
reaction
.
--
In
studying
the
liquid
phase
thermal
reaction
,
some
70
tubes
from
12
different
manifold
fillings
were
prepared
and
analyzed
.
Experiments
were
done
at
180
,
200
,
210
,
and
220-degrees
.
Following
observation
of
the
fact
that
the
reaction
rates
of
supposedly
identical
reaction
mixtures
prepared
on
the
same
filling
manifold
and
exposed
under
identical
conditions
often
differed
by
several
hundred
per
cent
,
a
systematic
series
of
experiments
was
undertaken
to
see
whether
the
difficulty
could
be
ascribed
to
the
method
of
preparing
the
chlorine
,
to
the
effects
of
oxygen
or
moisture
or
to
the
effect
of
surface
to
volume
ratio
in
the
reaction
tubes
.
In
addition
to
the
method
described
in
the
section
above
,
chlorine
and
radiochlorine
were
prepared
by
the
electrolysis
of
a
Af
eutectic
on
the
vacuum
line
,
and
by
exchange
of
Af
with
molten
Af
.
Calcium
hydride
was
substituted
for
Af
as
a
drying
agent
for
carbon
tetrachloride
.
No
correlation
between
these
variables
and
the
irreproducibility
of
the
results
was
found
.
The
reaction
rates
observed
at
200-degrees
ranged
from
Af
of
the
chlorine
exchanged
per
hour
to
0.7
exchanged
per
hour
.
In
most
cases
the
chlorine
concentration
was
about
Af
.
Sets
of
reaction
tubes
containing
0.2
of
an
atmosphere
of
added
oxygen
in
one
case
and
added
moisture
in
another
,
both
gave
reaction
rates
in
the
range
of
0.1
to
0.4
of
the
chlorine
exchanged
per
hour
.
No
detectable
reaction
was
found
at
room
temperature
for
reaction
mixtures
allowed
to
stand
up
to
5
hours
.
The
liquid
phase
photochemical
reaction
.
The
liquid
phase
photochemical
exchange
between
chlorine
and
carbon
tetrachloride
was
more
reproducible
than
the
thermal
exchange
,
although
still
erratic
.
The
improvement
was
most
noticeable
in
the
greater
consistency
among
reaction
cells
prepared
as
a
group
on
the
same
manifold
.
Rather
large
differences
were
still
found
between
reaction
cells
from
different
manifold
fillings
.
Some
80
reaction
tubes
from
13
manifold
fillings
were
illuminated
in
the
temperature
range
from
40
to
85-degrees
in
a
further
endeavor
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
irreproducibility
and
to
obtain
information
on
the
activation
energy
and
the
effect
of
light
intensity
.
In
all
cases
there
was
readily
measurable
exchange
after
as
little
as
one
hour
of
illumination
.
By
comparing
reaction
cells
sealed
from
the
same
manifold
temperature
dependency
corresponding
to
activation
energies
ranging
from
11
to
18
Af
was
observed
while
dependence
on
the
first
power
of
the
light
intensity
seemed
to
be
indicated
in
most
cases
.
It
was
possible
to
make
estimates
of
the
quantum
yield
by
observing
the
extent
of
reduction
of
a
uranyl
oxalate
actinometer
solution
illuminated
for
a
known
time
in
a
typical
reaction
cell
and
making
appropriate
conversions
based
on
the
differences
in
the
absorption
spectra
of
uranyl
oxalate
and
of
chlorine
,
and
considering
the
spectral
distribution
of
the
light
source
.
These
estimates
indicated
that
the
quantum
yield
for
the
exchange
of
chlorine
with
liquid
carbon
tetrachloride
at
65-degrees
is
of
the
order
of
magnitude
of
unity
.
When
typical
reaction
cells
to
which
0.3
of
an
atmosphere
of
oxygen
had
been
added
were
illuminated
,
chlorine
and
phosgene
were
produced
.
Exchange
was
also
observed
in
these
cells
,
which
had
chlorine
present
at
Af
.
The
photochemical
exchange
in
the
gas
phase
.
--
Although
there
was
some
variation
in
results
which
must
be
attributed
either
to
trace
impurities
or
to
variation
in
wall
effects
,
the
photochemical
exchange
in
the
gas
phase
was
sufficiently
reproducible
so
that
it
seemed
meaningful
to
compare
the
reaction
rates
in
different
series
of
reaction
tubes
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
on
the
effect
of
chlorine
concentration
and
of
carbon
tetrachloride
concentration
on
the
reaction
rate
.
Data
on
such
comparisons
together
with
data
on
the
effect
of
light
intensity
are
given
in
Table
1
.
,
In
series
1
,
the
relative
light
intensity
was
varied
by
varying
the
distance
of
the
lamp
from
the
reaction
cell
over
the
range
from
14.7
to
29.2
cm.
.
The
last
column
shows
the
rate
of
exchange
that
would
have
been
observed
at
a
relative
intensity
of
4
(
14.7
cm.
distance
)
calculated
on
the
assumptions
that
the
incident
light
intensity
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
distance
of
the
lamp
from
the
cell
and
that
the
rate
is
directly
proportional
to
the
incident
light
intensity
.
Direct
proportionality
of
the
rate
to
the
incident
intensity
has
also
been
assumed
in
obtaining
the
value
in
the
last
column
for
the
fourth
sample
of
series
2
,
where
the
light
intensity
was
reduced
by
use
of
a
screen
.
The
Poynting-Robertson
effect
(
Robertson
,
1937
;
;
Wyatt
and
Whipple
,
1950
)
,
which
is
a
retardation
of
the
orbital
motion
of
particles
by
the
relativistic
aberration
of
the
repulsive
force
of
the
impinging
solar
radiation
,
causes
the
dust
to
spiral
into
the
sun
in
times
much
shorter
than
the
age
of
the
Earth
.
The
radial
velocity
varies
inversely
as
the
particle
size
--
a
1000-m-diameter
particle
near
the
orbit
of
Mars
would
reach
the
sun
in
about
60
million
years
.
Whipple
(
1955
)
extends
the
effects
to
include
the
solar-corpuscular-radiation
pressure
,
which
increases
both
the
minimum
particle
size
and
the
drag
.
Further
,
the
corpuscular
radiation
,
i.e.
,
the
solar-wind
protons
,
must
sputter
away
the
surface
atoms
of
the
dust
and
cause
a
slow
diminution
in
size
,
with
a
resultant
increase
in
both
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
and
the
ratio
of
the
repulsive
force
to
the
gravitational
force
.
The
Poynting-Robertson
effect
causes
the
semi-major
axis
of
orbits
to
diminish
more
rapidly
than
the
semi-minor
axis
,
with
a
consequent
tendency
toward
circular
orbits
as
the
particles
move
toward
the
sun
.
Also
,
planetary
gravitational
attraction
increases
the
dust
concentration
near
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
as
the
sun
is
approached
.
At
one
astronomical
unit
from
the
sun
(
the
Earth's
distance
)
the
dust
orbits
are
probably
nearly
circular
.
If
such
is
the
case
,
the
particles
within
a
distance
of
about
Af
of
the
Earth
will
have
,
relative
to
the
Earth
,
a
kinetic
energy
less
than
their
potential
energy
and
they
will
be
captured
into
orbits
about
the
Earth
.
De
Jager
(
1955
)
has
calculated
the
times
required
for
these
particles
to
reach
the
atmosphere
under
the
influence
of
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
,
which
in
this
case
causes
the
orbits
to
become
more
and
more
eccentric
without
changing
the
semi-major
axis
.
This
effect
can
give
rise
to
a
blanket
of
micrometeorites
around
the
Earth
.
Since
there
is
a
continual
loss
of
micrometeoritic
material
in
space
because
of
the
radiation
effects
,
there
must
be
a
continual
replenishment
:
otherwise
,
micrometeorites
would
have
disappeared
from
interplanetary
space
.
There
are
several
possible
sources
.
According
to
Whipple
(
1955
)
,
cometary
debris
is
sufficient
to
replenish
the
material
spiraling
into
the
sun
,
maintaining
a
fairly
steady
state
.
Asteroidal
collisions
are
also
thought
to
contribute
material
.
It
is
also
possible
that
some
of
the
dust
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Earth
originated
from
meteoritic
impacts
upon
the
moon
.
5.3
direct
measurements
of
micrometeorite
flux
One
cannot
make
a
very
satisfactory
guess
about
the
micrometeorite
flux
in
space
.
Even
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Earth
,
where
information
has
been
obtained
both
directly
and
indirectly
,
the
derived
flux
values
vary
by
at
least
four
orders
of
magnitude
.
This
large
discrepancy
demonstrates
the
inadequacies
of
the
experimental
methods
and
the
lack
of
understanding
of
the
various
phenomena
involved
.
Beyond
a
few
million
kilometers
from
the
Earth
,
but
still
in
the
region
of
the
Earth's
orbit
,
a
prediction
of
the
flux
of
dust
is
even
more
unreliable
.
At
greater
distances
from
the
sun
,
the
situation
is
still
less
certain
.
There
are
several
sources
of
evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
.
Direct
information
has
been
obtained
from
rockets
and
satellites
equipped
with
impact
sensors
.
In
addition
,
the
size
distribution
obtained
from
visual
and
radar
observations
of
meteors
may
be
extrapolated
to
the
micrometeorite
domain
.
From
the
brightness
of
the
F
component
of
the
solar
corona
and
the
brightness
of
the
zodiacal
light
,
an
estimate
of
the
particle
sizes
,
concentrations
,
and
spatial
distribution
can
be
derived
for
regions
of
space
near
the
ecliptic
plane
.
Another
important
source
of
evidence
only
recently
receiving
much
attention
is
the
analysis
of
atmospheric
dust
for
a
meteoritic
component
.
The
cores
of
deep-sea
sediments
and
content
of
collectors
in
remote
regions
are
valuable
in
this
category
.
The
data
provide
a
measure
of
the
total
mass
of
cosmic
material
incident
upon
the
Earth
.
The
direct
evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
near
the
Earth
is
obtained
from
piezoelectric
sensors
(
essentially
microphones
)
and
from
wire
gages
;
;
these
instruments
are
installed
on
rockets
,
satellites
,
and
space
probes
.
Statistically
,
the
most
significant
data
have
been
collected
from
the
sensors
on
1958
Alpha
(
Explorer
1
)
,
1958
Delta
2
(
Sputnik
3
)
,
and
1959
Eta
(
Vanguard
3
)
.
These
vehicles
,
with
large
sensitive
areas
,
have
collected
data
for
long
enough
times
to
give
reliable
impact
rates
for
the
periods
of
exposure
.
Many
other
vehicles
with
smaller
sensitive-area
exposure-time
products
contribute
some
information
.
The
impact
rate
on
1958
Alpha
for
153
events
was
Af
for
particles
of
mass
greater
than
Af
(
Dubin
,
1960
)
;
;
this
mass
threshold
was
derived
from
the
detector
calibration
and
an
assumed
impact
velocity
of
Af
.
The
data
show
daily
and
diurnal
variations
.
Ninety
per
cent
of
the
153
recorded
impacts
occurred
between
midnight
and
noon
,
and
from
day
to
day
the
variation
of
the
rate
was
as
much
as
an
order
of
magnitude
.
One
may
conclude
that
most
of
the
detected
micrometeoritic
material
is
concentrated
in
orbital
streams
which
intersect
the
Earth's
orbit
.
There
have
been
contradictory
reports
from
1958
Delta
2
,
and
the
data
quoted
here
are
believed
to
be
the
more
reliable
.
On
May
15
,
a
very
large
increase
occurred
with
Af
of
mass
between
Af
and
Af
;
;
for
the
next
two
days
,
the
impact
rate
was
Af
;
;
and
for
the
next
nine
days
,
the
impact
rate
was
less
than
Af
(
Nazarova
,
1960
)
.
The
data
for
the
first
day
indicate
a
meteor
stream
with
a
very
high
concentration
of
particles
and
may
have
led
to
the
high
estimates
of
micrometeorite
flux
.
Preliminary
data
from
1959
Eta
give
an
average
impact
rate
of
Af
for
masses
larger
than
Af
for
about
1000
events
in
a
22-day
period
(
LaGow
and
Alexander
,
1960
)
.
The
day-to-day
rate
varied
by
less
than
a
factor
of
4.5
.
The
data
have
not
yet
been
analyzed
for
diurnal
variations
.
Note
that
the
mass
threshold
is
four
times
that
of
1958
Alpha
and
that
the
flux
is
one
fifth
as
large
.
If
one
assumes
that
the
average
flux
did
not
change
between
measurements
,
a
mass-distribution
curve
is
obtained
which
relates
the
flux
of
particles
larger
than
a
given
radius
to
the
inverse
7/2
power
of
the
radius
.
Space
probes
have
yielded
little
information
.
Pioneer
1
,
recorded
a
decrease
in
flux
with
distance
from
the
Earth
on
the
basis
of
11
counts
in
9
hours
.
With
detectors
sensitive
to
three
mass
intervals
and
based
on
a
few
counts
,
the
second
and
third
Russian
space
probes
indicate
that
the
flux
of
the
smallest
particles
detected
is
less
than
that
of
larger
ones
.
Being
based
on
so
few
events
,
these
results
are
of
dubious
validity
.
The
calibration
of
piezoelectric
sensors
in
terms
of
the
particle
parameters
is
very
uncertain
.
Many
workers
believe
that
the
response
is
proportional
to
the
incident
momentum
of
the
particles
,
a
relation
deduced
from
laboratory
results
linearly
extrapolated
to
meteoritic
velocities
.
However
,
one
must
expect
that
vaporization
and
ejection
of
material
by
hypervelocity
impacts
would
cause
a
deviation
from
a
linear
relationship
.
In
the
United
States
,
most
of
the
sensors
are
calibrated
by
dropping
small
spheres
on
their
sensitive
surfaces
.
The
Russian
experimenters
claim
that
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
impulse
from
the
sensors
is
caused
by
the
incident
momentum
with
the
remainder
being
momentum
of
ejected
material
from
the
sensor
.
This
``
ejection
''
momentum
is
linearly
related
to
the
particle
energy
.
They
quote
about
the
same
mass
threshold
as
that
of
the
U.S.
apparatus
,
but
a
momentum
threshold
about
40
times
greater
.
There
is
a
difference
in
the
experimental
arrangement
,
in
that
the
U.S.
microphones
are
attached
directly
to
the
vehicle
skin
while
the
Russian
instruments
are
isolated
from
the
skin
.
The
threshold
mass
is
derived
from
the
momentum
threshold
with
the
assumption
of
a
mean
impact
velocity
of
Af
in
the
U.S.
work
and
Af
in
the
U.S.S.R.
work
.
The
threshold
mass
of
about
Af
corresponds
to
a
10-M-diameter
sphere
of
density
Af
.
However
,
the
conversion
from
mass
to
size
is
unreliable
,
since
many
photographic
meteors
give
evidence
of
a
fluffy
,
loosely
bound
meteorite
structure
with
densities
as
low
as
Af
.
To
what
extent
such
low
density
applies
to
micrometeorites
is
unknown
.
The
velocity
value
used
is
also
open
to
some
question
;
;
if
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
dust
is
orbiting
about
the
Earth
,
only
about
one
third
the
above-mentioned
average
velocity
should
be
used
in
deriving
the
mass
.
Zodiacal
light
and
the
gegenschein
give
some
evidence
for
such
a
dust
blanket
,
a
phenomenon
also
to
be
expected
if
the
dust
before
capture
is
in
circular
orbits
about
the
sun
,
as
indicated
by
the
trend
of
the
smaller
visible
meteors
.
The
diurnal
variation
in
the
observed
flux
may
be
partly
due
to
the
dependence
of
the
detector
sensitivity
on
the
incident
velocity
.
The
flux
of
micrometeorites
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Earth
can
be
estimated
by
extrapolation
from
radar
and
visual
meteor
data
.
A
summary
of
meteorite
data
,
prepared
by
Whipple
(
1958
)
on
the
basis
of
photographic
,
visual
,
and
radar
evidence
,
is
given
in
Table
5-1
.
From
an
estimated
mass
of
25
g
for
a
zero-magnitude
meteorite
,
the
other
masses
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
a
mass
decrease
by
a
factor
of
2.512
for
each
unit
increase
in
magnitude
.
The
radius
is
calculated
from
the
mass
by
assuming
spheres
of
density
Af
except
for
the
smallest
particles
,
which
must
have
a
higher
mass
density
to
remain
in
the
solar
system
in
the
presence
of
solar-radiation
pressure
.
The
flux
values
are
for
all
particles
with
masses
greater
than
the
given
mass
and
are
based
on
an
estimate
of
the
numbers
of
visual
meteors
.
It
is
assumed
that
the
flux
values
increase
by
a
factor
of
2.512
per
magnitude
,
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
that
the
total
mass
flux
in
each
unit
range
in
magnitude
is
constant
.
The
values
agree
with
the
data
from
1958
Alpha
and
1959
Eta
.
The
figures
in
the
next-to-last
column
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
50
per
cent
shielding
by
the
Earth
;
;
hence
,
these
figures
apply
immediately
above
the
Earth's
atmosphere
.
The
unshielded
flux
is
given
in
the
last
column
;
;
these
figures
constitute
the
best
estimate
for
the
flux
in
interplanetary
space
near
the
Earth
.
Of
course
,
if
there
is
a
dust
blanket
around
the
Earth
,
the
fluxes
in
interplanetary
space
should
be
less
than
the
figures
given
here
.
Note
that
the
mass
scale
is
one
to
two
orders
of
magnitude
greater
than
some
previously
used
;
;
for
example
,
Jacchia
(
1948
)
derived
a
scale
of
0.15
g
for
a
Af
,
zero-magnitude
meteorite
.
The
older
scales
were
based
on
theoretical
estimates
of
the
conversion
efficiency
of
kinetic
energy
into
light
.
The
mass
scale
used
in
Table
5-1
was
derived
on
the
assumption
that
the
motion
of
the
glowing
trail
is
related
to
the
momentum
transfer
to
the
trail
by
the
meteorite
,
permitting
the
calculation
of
the
mass
if
the
velocity
is
known
(
Cook
and
Whipple
,
1958
)
.
A
concentration
distribution
has
been
derived
from
radar
observations
sensitive
to
the
fifteenth
magnitude
(
Manning
and
Eshleman
,
1959
)
.
Extrapolation
of
this
relationship
through
the
thirtieth
magnitude
covers
the
range
of
micrometeorites
.
The
approximate
equation
is
Af
,
where
N
is
the
number
of
Af
with
electron
line-density
greater
than
or
equal
to
Af
,
and
Q
is
proportional
to
the
mass
of
the
meteorite
.
Therefore
,
N
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
radius
cubed
and
in
fair
agreement
with
the
inverse
7/2
power
derived
from
1958
Alpha
and
1959
Eta
data
.
At
the
fifteenth
magnitude
,
Af
,
and
at
the
twenty-fifth
magnitude
,
Af
.
These
extrapolated
fluxes
are
about
an
order
of
magnitude
less
than
the
values
from
the
satellite
data
and
the
figures
in
Whipple's
table
.
The
extrapolation
may
be
in
error
for
several
reasons
.
The
observational
data
determining
the
concentration
distribution
have
a
range
of
error
which
is
magnified
in
the
extension
into
the
micrometeorite
region
.
The
solar-electromagnetic-
and
corpuscular-radiation
pressure
and
the
associated
Poynting-Robertson
effect
increase
in
effectiveness
as
the
particle
size
decreases
and
modify
the
distribution
and
limit
sizes
to
larger
than
a
few
microns
.
Also
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
source
of
all
or
part
of
the
dust
may
not
be
the
same
as
that
for
visual
or
radar
meteorites
(
Best
,
1960
)
,
and
the
same
distribution
would
not
be
expected
.

Indirect
indications
of
micrometeorite
flux
A
measure
of
the
total
mass
accretion
of
meteoritic
material
by
the
Earth
is
obtained
from
analyses
of
deep-sea
sediments
and
dust
collected
in
remote
regions
(
Pettersson
,
1960
)
.
Most
meteoritic
material
,
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
Earth's
surface
,
has
been
reduced
to
dust
or
to
spherules
of
ablated
material
in
its
passage
through
the
atmosphere
.
For
all
meteorites
,
the
average
nickel
content
is
about
2.5
per
cent
.
This
is
much
higher
than
the
nickel
content
of
terrestrial
dusts
and
sediments
and
provides
a
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
meteoritic
mass
influx
.
Present
data
indicate
an
accretion
of
about
Af
tons
per
year
over
the
entire
globe
,
or
about
Af
.
Biological
warfare
Biological
warfare
is
the
intentional
use
of
living
microorganisms
or
their
toxic
products
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
or
reducing
the
military
effectiveness
of
man
.
It
is
the
exploitation
of
the
inherent
potential
of
infectious
disease
agents
by
scientific
research
and
development
,
resulting
in
the
production
of
BW
weapons
systems
.
Man
may
also
be
injured
secondarily
by
damage
to
his
food
crops
or
domestic
animals
.
Biological
warfare
is
considered
to
be
primarily
a
strategic
weapon
.
The
major
reason
for
this
is
that
it
has
no
quick-kill
effect
.
The
incubation
period
of
infectious
disease
,
plus
a
variable
period
of
illness
even
before
a
lethal
effect
,
render
this
weapon
unsuitable
for
hand-to-hand
encounter
.
A
man
can
be
an
effective
fighting
machine
throughout
the
incubation
period
of
most
infectious
diseases
.
Thus
,
an
enemy
would
probably
use
this
weapon
for
attack
on
static
population
centers
such
as
large
cities
.
An
important
operational
procedure
in
BW
for
an
enemy
would
be
to
create
an
areosol
or
cloud
of
agent
over
the
target
area
.
This
concept
has
stimulated
much
basic
research
concerning
the
behavior
of
particulate
biological
materials
,
the
pathogenesis
of
respiratory
infections
,
the
medical
management
of
such
diseases
and
defense
against
their
occurrence
.
The
biological
and
physical
properties
of
infectious
particles
have
been
studied
intensively
during
the
past
fifteen
years
.
Much
new
equipment
and
many
unique
techniques
have
been
developed
for
the
quantitative
exposure
of
experimental
animals
to
aerosols
of
infectious
agents
contained
in
particles
of
specified
dimensional
characteristics
.
Much
information
has
been
gathered
relative
to
quantitative
sampling
and
assesment
techniques
.
Much
of
the
older
experimental
work
on
respiratory
infections
was
accomplished
by
very
artificial
procedures
.
The
intranasal
instillation
of
a
fluid
suspension
of
infectious
agent
in
an
anesthetized
animal
is
far
different
from
exposure
,
through
natural
respiration
,
to
aerosolized
organisms
.
The
importance
of
particle
size
in
such
aerosols
has
been
thoroughly
demonstrated
.
The
natural
anatomical
and
physiological
defensive
features
of
the
upper
respiratory
tract
,
such
as
the
turbinates
of
the
nose
and
the
cilia
of
the
trachea
and
larger
bronchi
,
are
capable
of
impinging
out
the
larger
particles
to
which
we
are
ordinarily
exposed
in
our
daily
existence
.
Very
small
particles
,
however
,
in
a
size
range
of
1
to
4
microns
in
diameter
are
capable
of
passing
these
impinging
barriers
and
entering
the
alveolar
bed
of
the
lungs
.
This
area
is
highly
susceptible
to
infection
.
The
entrance
and
retention
of
infectious
particles
in
the
alveoli
amounts
almost
to
an
intratissue
inoculation
.
The
relationship
between
particle
size
and
infectious
dose
is
illustrated
in
Table
1
.
In
considering
BW
defense
,
it
must
be
recognized
that
a
number
of
critical
meterological
parameters
must
be
met
for
an
aerosol
to
exhibit
optimum
effect
.
For
example
,
bright
sunlight
is
rapidly
destructive
for
living
microorganisms
suspended
in
air
.
There
are
optimal
humidity
requirements
for
various
agents
when
airborne
.
Neutral
or
inversion
meteorological
conditions
are
necessary
for
a
cloud
to
travel
along
the
surface
.
It
will
rise
during
lapse
conditions
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
certain
times
during
the
24-hour
daily
cycle
when
most
of
these
conditions
will
be
met
.
Certain
other
properties
of
small
particles
,
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
in
connection
with
penetration
of
the
respiratory
tract
,
are
noteworthy
in
defense
considerations
.
The
smaller
the
particle
the
further
it
will
travel
downwind
before
settling
out
.
An
aerosol
of
such
small
particles
,
moreover
,
diffuses
through
structures
in
much
the
same
manner
as
a
gas
.
There
may
be
a
number
of
secondary
effects
resulting
from
diffusion
through
buildings
such
as
widespread
contamination
of
kitchens
,
restaurants
,
food
stores
,
hospitals
,
etc.
.
Depending
on
the
organism
,
there
may
be
multiplication
in
some
food
or
beverage
products
,
i.e.
,
in
milk
for
example
.
The
secondary
consequences
from
this
could
be
very
serious
and
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
planning
for
defense
.
Something
of
the
behavior
of
clouds
of
small
particles
can
be
illustrated
by
the
following
field
trials
:
In
the
first
trial
an
inert
substance
was
disseminated
from
a
boat
travelling
some
ten
miles
off
shore
under
appropriately
selected
meteorological
conditions
.
Zinc
cadmium
sulfide
in
particles
of
2
microns
in
size
were
disseminated
.
This
material
fluoresces
under
ultraviolet
light
which
facilitates
its
sampling
and
assessment
.
Four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
was
disseminated
while
the
ship
was
traveling
a
distance
of
156
miles
.
Figure
1
describes
the
results
obtained
in
this
trial
.
The
particles
traveled
a
maximum
detected
distance
of
some
450
miles
.
From
these
dosage
isopleths
it
can
be
seen
that
an
area
of
over
34,000
square
miles
was
covered
.
These
dosages
could
have
been
increased
by
increasing
the
source
strength
which
was
small
in
this
case
.
The
behavior
of
a
biological
aerosol
,
on
a
much
smaller
scale
,
is
illustrated
by
a
specific
field
trial
conducted
with
a
non-pathogenic
organism
.
An
aqueous
suspension
of
the
spores
of
B.
subtilis
,
var.
niger
,
generally
known
as
Bacillus
globigii
,
was
aerosolized
using
commercially
available
nozzles
.
A
satisfactory
cloud
was
produced
even
though
these
nozzles
were
only
about
5
per
cent
efficient
in
producing
an
initial
cloud
in
the
size
range
of
1
to
5
microns
.
In
this
test
,
130
gallons
of
a
suspension
,
having
a
count
of
Af
organisms
per
ml
,
or
a
total
of
approximately
Af
spores
,
was
aerosolized
.
The
spraying
operation
was
conducted
from
the
rear
deck
of
a
small
Naval
vessel
,
cruising
two
miles
off-shore
and
vertical
to
an
on-sure
breeze
.
Spraying
continued
along
a
two-mile
course
.
This
operation
was
started
at
5:00
p.m.
and
lasted
for
29
minutes
.
There
was
a
slight
lapse
condition
,
a
moderate
fog
,
and
100
per
cent
relative
humidity
.
A
network
of
sampling
stations
had
been
set
up
on
shore
.
These
were
located
at
the
homes
of
Government
employees
,
in
Government
Offices
,
buildings
and
reservations
within
the
trial
area
.
A
rough
attempt
was
made
to
characterize
the
vertical
profile
of
the
cloud
by
taking
samples
from
outside
the
windows
on
the
first
,
ninth
,
and
fifteenth
floors
of
a
Government
office
building
.
All
samplers
were
operated
for
a
period
of
two
hours
except
one
,
which
was
operated
for
four
hours
.
In
this
instance
,
there
was
a
dosage
of
562
during
the
first
two
hours
and
a
total
dosage
of
1980
for
the
four-hour
period
,
a
four-fold
increase
.
This
suggests
that
the
sampling
period
,
particularly
at
the
more
distant
locations
,
should
have
been
increased
.
As
can
be
seen
from
Figure
2
,
an
extensive
area
was
covered
by
this
aerosol
.
The
maximum
distance
sampled
was
23
miles
from
the
source
.
As
can
be
seen
from
these
dosage
isopleths
,
approximately
100
square
miles
was
covered
within
the
area
sampled
.
It
is
quite
likely
that
an
even
greater
area
was
covered
,
particularly
downwind
.
The
dosages
in
the
three
levels
of
the
vertical
profile
were
:
Af
.
This
was
not
,
of
course
,
enough
sampling
to
give
a
satisfactory
description
of
the
vertical
diffusion
of
the
aerosol
.
A
number
of
unique
medical
problems
might
be
created
when
man
is
exposed
to
an
infectious
agent
through
the
respiratory
route
rather
than
by
natural
portal
of
entry
.
Some
agents
have
been
shown
to
be
much
more
toxic
or
infectious
to
experimental
animals
when
exposed
to
aerosols
of
optimum
particle
size
than
by
the
natural
portal
.
Botulinal
toxin
,
for
example
,
is
several
thousand-fold
more
toxic
by
this
route
than
when
given
per
os
.
In
some
instances
a
different
clinical
disease
picture
may
result
from
this
route
of
exposure
,
making
diagnosis
difficult
.
In
tularemia
produced
by
aerosol
exposure
,
one
would
not
expect
to
find
the
classical
ulcer
of
``
rabbit
fever
''
on
a
finger
.
An
enemy
would
obviously
choose
an
agent
that
is
believed
to
be
highly
infectious
.
Agents
that
are
known
to
cause
frequent
infections
among
laboratory
workers
such
as
those
causing
Q
fever
,
tularemia
,
brucellosis
,
glanders
,
coccidioidomycosis
,
etc.
,
belong
in
this
category
.
An
agent
would
likely
be
selected
which
would
possess
sufficient
viability
and
virulence
stability
to
meet
realistic
minimal
logistic
requirements
.
It
is
,
obviously
,
a
proper
goal
of
research
to
improve
on
this
property
.
In
this
connection
it
should
be
capable
of
being
disseminated
without
excessive
destruction
.
Moreover
,
it
should
not
be
so
fastidious
in
its
growth
requirements
as
to
make
production
on
a
militarily
significant
scale
improbable
.
An
aggressor
would
use
an
agent
against
which
there
was
a
minimal
naturally
acquired
or
artificially
induced
immunity
in
a
target
population
.
A
solid
immunity
is
the
one
effective
circumstance
whereby
attack
by
a
specific
agent
can
be
neutralized
.
It
must
be
remembered
,
however
,
that
there
are
many
agents
for
which
there
is
no
solid
immunity
and
a
partial
or
low-grade
immunity
may
be
broken
by
an
appropriate
dose
of
agent
.
There
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
organisms
from
which
selection
for
a
specified
military
purpose
might
be
made
.
An
enemy
might
choose
an
acutely
debilitating
microorganism
,
a
chronic
disease
producer
or
one
causing
a
high
rate
of
lethality
.
It
is
possible
that
certain
mutational
forms
may
be
produced
such
as
antibiotic
resistant
strains
.
Mutants
may
also
be
developed
with
changes
in
biochemical
properties
that
are
of
importance
in
identification
.
All
of
these
considerations
are
of
critical
importance
in
considering
defense
and
medical
management
.
Biological
agents
are
,
of
course
,
highly
host-specific
.
They
do
not
destroy
physical
structures
as
is
true
of
high
explosives
.
This
may
be
of
overriding
importance
in
considering
military
objectives
.
The
question
of
epidemic
disease
merits
some
discussion
.
Only
a
limited
effort
has
been
devoted
to
this
problem
.
Some
of
those
who
question
the
value
of
BW
have
assumed
that
the
only
potential
would
be
in
the
establishment
of
epidemics
.
They
then
point
out
that
with
our
present
lack
of
knowledge
of
all
the
factors
concerned
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
epidemics
,
it
is
unlikely
that
a
planned
episode
could
be
initiated
.
They
argue
further
(
and
somewhat
contradictorily
)
that
our
knowledge
and
resources
in
preventive
medicine
would
make
it
possible
to
control
such
an
outbreak
of
disease
.
This
is
why
this
approach
to
BW
defense
has
not
been
given
major
attention
.
Our
major
problem
is
what
an
enemy
might
accomplish
in
an
initial
attack
on
a
target
.
This
,
of
course
,
does
not
eliminate
from
consideration
for
this
purpose
agents
that
are
associated
naturally
with
epidemic
disease
.
A
hypothetical
example
will
illustrate
this
point
.
Let
us
assume
that
it
would
be
possible
for
an
enemy
to
create
an
aerosol
of
the
causative
agent
of
epidemic
typhus
(
Rickettsia
prowazwki
)
over
City
A
and
that
a
large
number
of
cases
of
typhus
fever
resulted
therefrom
.
No
epidemic
was
initiated
nor
was
one
expected
because
the
population
in
City
A
was
not
lousy
.
Lousiness
is
a
prerequisite
for
epidemic
typhus
.
In
this
case
,
then
,
the
military
objective
was
accomplished
with
an
epidemic
agent
solely
through
the
results
secured
in
the
initial
attack
.
This
was
done
with
full
knowledge
that
there
would
be
no
epidemic
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
similar
attack
might
have
been
made
on
City
B
whose
population
was
known
to
be
lousy
.
One
might
expect
some
spread
of
the
disease
in
this
case
resulting
in
increased
effectiveness
of
the
attack
.
The
major
defensive
problems
are
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
overt
military
delivery
of
biological
agents
from
appropriate
disseminating
devices
.
It
should
be
no
more
difficult
to
deliver
such
devices
than
other
weapons
.
The
same
delivery
vehicles
--
whether
they
be
airplanes
,
submarines
or
guided
missiles
--
should
be
usable
.
If
it
is
possible
for
an
enemy
to
put
an
atomic
bomb
on
a
city
,
it
should
be
equally
possible
to
put
a
cloud
of
biological
agent
over
that
city
.
Biological
agents
are
,
moreover
,
suitable
for
delivery
through
enemy
sabotage
which
imposes
many
problems
in
defense
.
A
few
obvious
target
areas
of
great
importance
might
be
mentioned
.
The
air
conditioning
and
ventilating
systems
of
large
buildings
are
subject
to
attack
.
America
is
rapidly
becoming
a
nation
that
uses
processed
,
precooked
and
even
predigested
foods
.
This
is
an
enormous
industry
that
is
subject
to
sabotage
.
One
must
include
the
preparation
of
soft
drinks
and
the
processing
of
milk
and
milk
products
.
Huge
industries
are
involved
also
in
the
production
of
biological
products
,
drugs
and
cosmetics
which
are
liable
to
this
type
of
attack
.
A
variety
of
techniques
have
been
directed
toward
the
isolation
and
study
of
blood
group
antibodies
.
These
include
low-temperature
ethanol
(
Cohn
)
fractionation
,
electrophoresis
,
ultracentrifugation
and
column
chromatography
on
ion
exchange
celluloses
.
Modifications
of
the
last
technique
have
been
applied
by
several
groups
of
investigators
.
Abelson
and
Rawson
,
using
a
stepwise
elution
scheme
,
fractionated
whole
sera
containing
ABO
and
Rh
antibodies
on
diethylaminoethyl
DEAE
cellulose
and
carboxymethyl
cellulose
.
Speer
and
coworkers
,
in
a
similar
study
of
blood
group
antibodies
of
whole
sera
,
used
a
series
of
gradients
for
elution
from
Aj
.
Fahey
and
Morrison
used
a
single
,
continuous
gradient
at
constant
pH
for
the
fractionation
of
anti-A
and
anti-B
agglutinins
from
preisolated
**yg-globulin
samples
.
In
the
present
work
whole
sera
have
been
fractionated
by
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
using
single
gradients
similar
to
those
described
by
Sober
and
Peterson
,
and
certain
chemical
and
serological
properties
of
the
fractions
containing
antibodies
of
the
ABO
and
Rh
systems
have
been
described
.
Materials
and
methods
samples
.
Serum
samples
were
obtained
from
normal
group
A
,
group
B
and
group
O
donors
.
Three
of
the
anti-Rh
sera
used
were
taken
from
recently
sensitized
individuals
.
One
contained
complete
antibody
and
had
a
titer
of
1
:
512
in
saline
.
The
second
contained
incomplete
antibody
and
showed
titers
of
1
:
256
in
albumin
and
1
:
2048
by
the
indirect
Coombs
test
.
The
third
,
containing
the
mixed
type
of
complete
and
incomplete
antibodies
,
had
titers
of
1
:
256
in
saline
,
1
:
512
in
albumin
and
1
:
1024
by
the
indirect

test
.
In
addition
one
serum
was
obtained
from
a
donor
(
R.
E.
)
who
had
been
sensitized
6
years
previously
.
This
serum
exhibited
titers
of
1
:
16
in
albumin
and
1
:
256
by
the
indirect
Coombs
test
.
These
antibody
titers
were
determined
by
reaction
with
homozygous

anti-B
activities
were
determined
in
fractions
from
the
sera
of
group
A
,
group
B
or
group
O
donors
by
the
following
tube
agglutination
methods
.
One
drop
of
each
sample
was
added
to
one
drop
of
a
2%
suspension
of
group
Af

group
B
red
cells
in
a
small
Af
test
tube
.
In
several
instances
group
O
cells
were
also
used
as
controls
.
The
red
cells
were
used
within
2
days
after
donation
and
were
washed
with
large
amounts
of
saline
before
use
.
The
mixtures
of
sample
plus
cell
suspension
were
allowed
to
stand
at

temperature
for
1
Aj
.
The
tubes
were
then
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
and
examined
macroscopically
for

For
the
albumin
method
,
equal
volumes
of
30%

and
2%
cells
suspended
in
saline
were
allowed
to
stand
at

for
1
hr
and
then
were
centrifuged
at
1000

All
samples
were
tested
by
both
the
saline
and

methods
.
The
activities
of
fractions
of
sera
containing
Rh
antibodies
were
tested
by
the

techniques
.
Homozygous

were
used
to
test

,
in
the
interest
of
clarity
and
conciseness
only
the
results
obtained
with
homozygous

and
homozygous
Af
cells
will
be
presented
here
.
The
saline
and
albumin
tests
were
performed
as
described
for
the
ABO
samples
except
that
the
mixture
was
incubated
for
1
hr
at
37-degrees-C
before
centrifugation
.
The
saline
tubes
were
saved
and
used
for
the
indirect
Coombs
test
in
the
following
manner
.
The
cells
were
washed
three
times
with
saline
,
anti-human
serum
was
added
,
the
cells
were
resuspended
,
and
the
mixture
was
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
and
examined
for
agglutination
.
The
anti-human
sera
used
were
prepared
by
injecting
whole
human
serum
into
rabbits
.
Those
antisera
shown
by
immunoelectrophoresis
to
be
of
the
``
broad
spectrum
''
type
were
selected
for
use
in
the
present
study
.
The
red
cells
for
the
Rh
antibody
tests
were
used
within
3
days
after
drawing
except
for
the
Af
cells
,
which
had
been
glycerolized
and
stored
at
-20-degrees-C
for
approximately
1
year
.
These
cells
were
thawed
at
37-degrees-C
for
30
min
and
were
deglycerolized
by
alternately
centrifuging
and
mixing
with
descending
concentrations
of
glycerol
solutions
(
20
,

Chromatography
.
Blood
samples
were
allowed
to
clot
at
room
temperature
for
3
hr
,
centrifuged
and
the
serum
was
removed
.
The
serum
was
measured
volumetrically
and
subsequently
dialyzed
in
the
cold
for
at
least
24
hr
against
three
to
four
changes
,
approximately
750
ml
each
,
of
``
starting
buffer
''
.
This
buffer
,
pH
8.6
,
was
0.005
M
in
Af
and
0.039
M
in
tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminometha
(
Tris
)
.
After
dialysis
the
sample
was
centrifuged
and
the
supernatant
placed
on
a
Af
cm
column
of
EEAE-cellulose
equilibrated
with
starting
buffer
.
The
DEAE-cellulose
,
containing
0.78
mEq
of
N/g
,
was
prepared
in
our
laboratory
by
the
method
of
Peterson
and
Sober
(

)
from
powdered
cellulose
,
100
-
230
mesh
.
The
small
amount
of
insoluble
material
which
precipitated
during
dialysis
was
suspended
in
approximately
5
ml
of
starting
buffer
,
centrifuged
,
resuspended
in
2.5
ml
of
isotonic
saline
and
tested
for
antibody
activity
.
The
chromatography
was
done
at
6-degrees-C
using
gradient
elution
,
essentially
according
to
Sober
and
Peterson
.
The
deep
concave
gradient
employed
(

)
was
obtained
with
a
nine-chambered
gradient
elution
device
(

)
)
and
has
been
described
elsewhere
.
The
other
,
a
shallow
concave
gradient
(

)
,
was
produced
with
a
so-called
``
cone-sphere
''
apparatus
,
the
``
cone
''
being
a
2-liter
Erlenmeyer
flask
and
the
``
sphere

''
a
2-liter
round-bottom
flask
.
Each
initially
contained
1700
ml
of
buffer
;
;
in
the

and
in
the

was
used
and
12
ml

were
collected
.
Approximately
165

were
obtained
from
each

.
These
were
read
at

temperature
was
maintained
at
2-degrees-C
by
surrounding
the
apparatus
with
ice
.
Because
negative
pressure
dialysis
gave
better
recovery
of
proteins
,
permitted
detection
of
proteins
concentrated
from
very
dilute
solutions
and
was
a
gentler
procedure
,
it
was
used
in
all
but
the
earliest
experiments
.
Paper
electrophoresis
was
carried
out
on
the
concentrated
samples
in
a
Spinco
model
R
cell
using
barbital
buffer
,
pH
8.6
,
ionic
strength
0.075
,
at
room
temperature
on
Whatman
3MM
filter
paper
.
Five
milliamperes/cell
were
applied
for
18
hr
,
after
which
the
strips
were
stained
with
bromphenol
blue
and
densitometry
was
carried
out
using
a
Spinco
Analytrol
.
When
paper
electrophoresis
was
to
be
used
for
preparation
,
eight
strips
of
a
whole
serum
sample
or
a
chromatographic
fraction
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
were
run/chamber
under
the
conditions
described
above
.
At
the
end
of
the
run
,
the
strips
in
the
third
and
sixth
positions
in
each
chamber
were
dried
,
stained
for
1
hr
,
washed
and
dried
,
while
the
other
strips
were
maintained
in
a
horizontal
position
at
1-degree-C
.
The
unstained
strips
were
then
marked
,
using
the
stained
ones
as
a
guide
,
and
cut
transversely
so
as
to
separate
the
various
protein
bands
.
The
strip
sections
containing
a
given
protein
were
pooled
,
eluted
with
0.5
ml
of
isotonic
saline
,
and
the
eluates
were
tested
for
antibody
activity
.
Ultracentrifugation
.
Fractions
from
the
column
which
were
to
be
subjected
to
analytical
ultracentrifugation
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
and
dialyzed
for
16
hr
in
the
cold
against
at
least
500
volumes
of
phosphate-buffered
saline
,
pH
7.2
,
ionic
strength
0.154
.
They
were
then
centrifuged
at
59,780
Pm
for
35
to
80
min
at
20-degrees-C
in
a
Spinco
model
E
ultracentrifuge
at
a
protein
concentration
of
1.00
to
1.25%
.
Sedimentation
coefficients
were
computed
as
Af
values
and
relative
amounts
of
the
various
components
were
calculated
from
the
Schlieren
patterns
.
For
preparative
ultracentrifugation
,
fractions
from
the
column
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
to
volumes
of
1
ml
or
less
,
transferred
to
cellulose
tubes
and
diluted
to
12
ml
with
isotonic
saline
.
Ultracentrifugation
was
then
carried
out
in
a
Spinco
model
L
ultracentrifuge
at
40,000
rpm
for
125
to
150
min
,
refrigeration
being
used
throughout
the
run
.
Successive
1-ml
fractions
were
then
drawn
off
with
a
hypodermic
syringe
,
starting
at
the
top
of
the
tube
,
and
tested
for
agglutinin
activity
.
Other
methods
will
be
described
below
.
Experimental
and
results
The
insoluble
material
which
precipitated
during
dialysis
against
starting
buffer
always
showed
intense
agglutinin
activity
,
regardless
of
the
blood
group
of
the
donor
.
With
either
of
the
gradients
described
,
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
separated
agglutinins
of
the
ABO
series
into
at
least
three
regions
(
Figs.
1
and
2
)
:
one
of
extremely
low
anionic
binding
capacity
,
one
of
low
anionic
binding
capacity
and
one
of
high
anionic
binding
capacity
.
These
have
been
labeled
Regions
