It
is
recognized
that
a
mail
questionnaire
has
inherent
limitations
.
There
is
the
danger
that
the
questions
will
mean
different
things
to
different
respondents
.
Simple
``
yes
''
or
``
no
''
answers
do
not
reveal
the
different
shades
of
opinion
that
the
various
respondents
may
have
.
A
respondent
may
want
to
make
alternative
answers
because
he
does
not
know
the
precise
circumstances
assumed
in
the
question
.
There
is
also
the
problem
of
the
respondent's
frame
of
reference
.
Is
the
respondent
making
a
recommendation
for
his
own
benefit
,
for
the
benefit
of
his
industry
,
for
the
benefit
of
a
specific
government
department
or
service
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
defense
program
,
for
the
benefit
of
small
business
,
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayers
?
?
There
is
also
the
question
of
whether
the
respondent
based
his
answers
on
factual
information
and
carefully
considered
judgment
,
or
whether
his
answers
were
casual
guesses
.
Finally
,
there
is
the
question
of
how
strongly
an
expressed
opinion
is
held
--
whether
it
is
a
firm
opinion
or
one
that
the
respondent
favors
only
slightly
over
the
alternatives
.
The
research
team
was
very
mindful
of
these
dangers
and
limitations
of
a
mail
questionnaire
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
however
,
the
team
considered
it
would
provide
the
most
useful
information
at
this
point
.
In
the
preparation
of
the
questionnaire
the
problems
noted
above
were
carefully
considered
,
and
the
structure
and
phraseology
used
were
designed
to
minimize
the
effects
of
these
limitations
.
B
.
Design
of
the
questionnaire
The
questionnaire
was
designed
to
elicit
three
types
of
information
:
(
1
)
the
facts
regarding
certain
characteristics
of
the
respondents
,
including
their
experience
with
,
and
interest
in
,
securing
defense
business
;
;
(
2
)
the
actual
selling
and
buying
practices
of
the
respondents
;
;
and
(
3
)
the
attitudes
and
opinions
of
the
respondents
concerning
bidding
procedures
and
the
methods
of
awarding
defense
contracts
.
It
was
hoped
that
the
facts
concerning
the
characteristics
and
practices
of
the
respondents
would
offer
clues
to
the
reasons
why
they
took
the
positions
and
made
the
recommendations
which
they
did
.
The
major
sections
of
the
questionnaire
(
see
Appendix
B
)
are
devoted
to
the
following
:
1
.
Information
for
classifying
respondents
(
Part
A
of
the
questionnaire
)
2
.
Characteristics
of
defense
sales
activities
(
Part
B
of
the
questionnaire
)
3
.
Respondents'
practices
in
participating
in
advertised
bidding
for
defense
business
(
Part
C
of
the
questionnaire
)
4
.
Respondents'
practices
in
participating
in
negotiated
bidding
for
defense
purposes
(
Part
D
of
the
questionnaire
)
5
.
Respondents'
opinions
regarding
advertised
bidding
(
Part
E
of
the
questionnaire
)
6
.
Respondents'
opinions
regarding
negotiated
bidding
(
Part
F
of
the
questionnaire
)
7
.
Respondents'
preferences
regarding
the
methods
of
awarding
defense
contracts
(
Part
G
of
the
questionnaire
)
The
questionnaire
provided
a
place
for
the
name
of
the
respondent
but
stated
that
identification
of
the
respondent
was
optional
.
The
questionnaire
also
stated
that
,
in
any
event
,
all
replies
would
be
treated
confidentially
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
75
per
cent
of
those
who
returned
the
questionnaire
identified
themselves
.
C
.
Preparation
and
pretest
of
the
questionnaire
The
research
team
prepared
and
then
revised
the
questionnaire
over
a
period
of
six
months
.
In
June
,
1960
,
an
early
draft
of
the
questionnaire
,
along
with
a
cover
letter
,
was
mailed
to
fourteen
companies
in
the
state
of
Washington
.
Several
days
after
the
companies
had
received
the
questionnaire
,
members
of
the
research
team
contacted
the
presidents
of
eleven
of
these
companies
in
person
or
by
phone
to
discuss
any
ambiguities
or
difficulties
the
addressees
might
have
experienced
in
completing
the
questionnaire
.
This
test
resulted
in
further
revisions
of
the
questionnaire
.
The
research
team
was
concerned
that
responses
from
firms
in
the
state
of
Washington
might
not
be
typical
of
those
throughout
the
country
,
or
that
the
results
might
be
different
when
no
phone
or
personal
follow-up
was
made
.
Accordingly
,
another
test
of
the
questionaire
was
made
.
The
revised
draft
was
mailed
in
July
,
1960
,
to
100
firms
throughout
the
United
States
.
Fifty
of
the
100
firms
were
selected
on
a
random
basis
from
3,500
names
submitted
by
member
companies
of
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
(
AIA
list
)
and
fifty
were
selected
in
a
similar
manner
from
a
list
of
1,500
names
compiled
by
the
research
team
from
the
Thomas
Register
(
TR
list
)
.
The
method
of
compiling
the
AIA
and
TR
lists
will
be
described
later
.
Ten
days
after
the
questionnaires
were
mailed
,
follow-up
airmail
postcards
were
sent
urging
those
companies
which
had
not
yet
returned
their
questionnaires
to
do
so
at
once
.
Twenty-eight
returns
in
all
were
received
.
The
responses
were
carefully
checked
for
obvious
errors
in
the
answers
or
for
questions
that
were
apparently
not
understood
by
the
respondent
.
The
cover
letter
,
questionnaire
,
and
follow-up
postcard
were
then
revised
into
final
form
(
see
Appendixes
A
,
B
,
and
C
)
.
D
.
Compilation
of
mailing
lists
The
objective
of
the
study
was
to
determine
the
opinions
and
practices
of
small
firms
selling
to
defense
programs
.
The
firms
to
receive
the
questionnaires
were
selected
with
this
objective
in
mind
.
Three
lists
of
companies
were
made
and
used
in
the
study
.
The
first
was
a
list
of
fourteen
manufacturing
companies
located
in
the
state
of
Washington
which
were
personally
known
to
the
research
team
to
be
active
in
defense
work
.
The
primary
consideration
in
the
compilation
of
this
list
was
convenience
in
discussing
the
questionnaire
with
company
officers
.
The
second
list
was
derived
from
a
group
of
approximately
8,000
names
supplied
to
the
research
team
by
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
.
These
names
were
secured
from
member
companies
by
the
Association
from
the
forty-four
sources
listed
in
Appendix
Aj
.
Each
source
selected
from
its
approved
bidders
list
about
200
firms
which
it
believed
to
be
small
businesses
that
participated
in
the
production
of
weapons
and
weapon
support
systems
.
Where
possible
,
the
name
of
an
executive
was
supplied
along
with
the
company
name
and
address
.
The
forty-four
lists
supplied
by
the
AIA
member
companies
were
merged
and
duplicate
names
were
eliminated
.
There
was
further
elimination
of
all
companies
that
were
not
accompanied
by
the
name
of
a
responsible
company
executive
.
The
remaining
names
were
then
checked
against
the
Thomas
Register
list
(
see
below
)
and
duplicate
names
were
removed
from
the
AIA
lists
.
By
these
steps
the
final
AIA
list
was
reduced
from
8,000
to
3,500
.
The
third
list
was
selected
by
the
research
team
on
a
random
basis
from
the
Thomas
Register
.
It
was
compiled
as
a
control
sample
to
determine
if
the
opinions
and
practices
of
companies
on
the
lists
submitted
by
the
members
of
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
were
materially
different
from
those
of
other
small
firms
selling
to
defense
programs
.
Such
a
difference
might
have
resulted
from
:
1
.
The
fact
that
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
members
whose
lists
were
used
did
not
comprise
all
firms
engaged
in
defense
programs
.
2
.
The
fact
that
companies
on
the
AIA
lists
were
already
participating
in
the
defense
program
because
of
the
manner
of
their
selection
.
Accordingly
,
as
``
in-group
''
,
they
might
have
different
opinions
and
practices
than
an
``
out-group
''
composed
of
those
companies
not
so
participating
but
interested
in
defense
business
.
3
.
The
fact
that
AIA
lists
might
not
have
been
selected
on
a
random
basis
.
The
control
sample
was
selected
by
taking
the
bottom
name
of
each
of
the
two
columns
of
names
on
each
page
of
the
alphabetical
listing
of
manufacturers
in
the
Thomas
Register
.
If
the
bottom
name
in
each
column
did
not
have
a
responsible
executive
identified
,
the
next
name
above
which
identified
such
a
responsible
executive
was
substituted
.
Fifteen
hundred
names
were
selected
in
this
fashion
.
E
.
Mailing
the
questionnaire
Each
questionnaire
was
mailed
with
a
cover
letter
addressed
personally
to
the
president
or
other
executive
of
each
firm
.
The
questionnaires
were
mailed
in
Seattle
,
Washington
,
and
sent
by
regular
mail
to
addresses
in
the
states
of
Idaho
,
Montana
,
Oregon
,
and
Washington
.
Airmail
was
used
for
the
addresses
outside
the
Pacific
Northwest
.
Each
letter
contained
a
postage-prepaid
return
envelope
by
regular
mail
for
addresses
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
,
and
by
airmail
for
those
outside
the
Pacific
Northwest
.
Approximately
ten
days
after
the
questionnaire
was
mailed
,
a
follow-up
airmail
postcard
was
sent
to
each
of
the
original
names
.
The
first
test
mailing
(
to
14
companies
)
was
made
in
June
,
1960
.
The
second
test
mailing
(
to
100
companies
)
was
made
in
July
,
1960
.
The
final
mailing
of
the
questionnaire
was
made
late
in
August
,
1960
,
to
4,900
firms
consisting
of
3,450
from
the
AIA
list
and
1,450
from
the
TR
list
.
F
.
Returns
received
Over
1,000
returns
were
received
within
two
weeks
after
the
final
mailing
was
made
.
They
continued
to
arrive
until
the
end
of
December
,
1960
,
by
which
time
a
total
of
1,343
returns
were
received
representing
26.8
per
cent
of
the
5,014
questionnaires
sent
out
.
Fifty-seven
returns
could
not
be
used
because
they
were
incomplete
or
received
too
late
to
be
processed
.
The
remaining
1,286
returns
that
were
processed
came
from
the
categories
in
Table
2
.
G
.
Processing
the
returns
Each
questionnaire
was
audited
for
obvious
mistakes
and
for
comments
,
and
was
identified
by
a
serial
number
,
by
the
source
list
from
which
the
company
name
was
selected
,
and
by
the
geographical
location
of
the
company
as
determined
by
the
postmark
on
the
return
envelope
.
All
responses
,
except
comments
,
were
numerically
coded
to
permit
use
of
data-processing
equipment
.
The
codes
were
key-punched
into
IBM
punch
cards
and
verified
.
Each
return
required
three
cards
and
involved
key
punching
228
digital
columns
.
In
order
to
be
able
to
properly
relate
the
data
for
a
single
company
each
of
the
three
cards
comprising
the
set
for
each
firm
was
identified
with
the
appropriate
serial
number
of
the
respondent
.
The
cards
were
then
processed
using
standard
IBM
punch
card
equipment
,
including
an
IBM
650
computer
.
The
first
step
in
processing
was
to
analyze
the
returns
from
Questions
1
,
2
,
and
3
to
determine
whether
the
respondents
were
large
businesses
or
small
businesses
,
in
accordance
with
the
definitions
contained
in
ASPR
Section
1-701
.
(
see
Chapter
2
.
)
The
results
are
shown
in
Table
3
.
The
returns
from
companies
classified
as
large
businesses
were
set
aside
and
not
used
because
they
were
not
relevant
to
a
study
of
the
opinions
and
practices
of
small
firms
.
The
second
step
in
processing
was
to
compare
the
responses
from
companies
on
the
AIA
list
with
those
from
companies
on
the
TR
list
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
merge
the
responses
for
the
purposes
of
the
study
.
The
methods
and
results
of
this
comparative
analysis
are
described
in
Appendix
Aj
.
It
was
concluded
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
process
the
two
groups
of
responses
as
a
single
sample
of
all
small
businesses
engaged
in
,
or
wishing
to
sell
to
,
defense
programs
.
In
the
first
place
,
the
two
groups
of
firms
,
when
combined
,
had
characteristics
and
practices
that
were
more
representative
of
companies
that
were
the
subject
of
this
study
than
did
the
firms
from
the
AIA
list
alone
.
The
vast
Central
Valley
of
California
is
one
of
the
most
productive
agricultural
areas
in
the
world
.
During
the
summer
of
1960
,
it
became
the
setting
for
a
bitter
and
basic
labor-management
struggle
.
The
contestants
in
this
economic
struggle
are
the
Agricultural
Workers
Organizing
Committee
(
AWOC
)
of
the
AFL-CIO
and
the
agricultural
employers
of
the
State
.
By
virtue
of
the
legal
responsibilities
of
the
Department
of
Employment
in
the
farm
placement
program
,
we
necessarily
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
between
these
two
forces
.
It
is
not
a
pleasant
or
easy
position
,
but
one
we
have
endeavored
to
maintain
.
We
have
sought
to
be
strictly
neutral
as
between
the
parties
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
required
frequently
to
rule
on
specific
issues
or
situations
as
they
arose
.
Inevitably
,
one
side
was
pleased
and
the
other
displeased
,
regardless
of
how
we
ruled
.
Often
the
displeased
parties
interpreted
our
decision
as
implying
favoritism
toward
the
other
.
We
have
consoled
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
this
is
a
normal
human
reaction
and
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
any
decision
in
an
adversary
proceeding
.
It
is
disconcerting
,
nevertheless
,
to
read
in
a
labor
weekly
,
``
Perluss
knuckles
down
to
growers
''
,
and
then
to
be
confronted
with
a
growers'
publication
which
states
,
``
Perluss
recognizes
obviously
phony
and
trumped-up
strikes
as
bona
fide
''
.
For
a
number
of
years
,
there
have
been
sporadic
attempts
in
California
to
organize
farm
workers
.
These
attempts
met
with
little
sucess
for
a
variety
of
reasons
.
They
were
inadequately
financed
,
without
experienced
leadership
,
and
lacked
the
general
support
of
organized
labor
as
a
whole
.
This
past
year
the
pattern
has
been
different
:
The
organizing
program
had
the
full
support
of
the
AFL-CIO
,
which
supplied
staff
and
money
to
the
AWOC
,
as
well
as
moral
support
.
Leadership
was
experienced
and
skillful
,
and
financial
resources
were
significant
.
Regardless
of
where
personal
sympathies
may
lie
as
between
the
parties
,
failure
to
recognize
these
changed
conditions
would
be
to
ignore
the
facts
of
life
.
As
a
result
of
these
changed
conditions
,
the
impact
of
the
organizational
effort
on
agricultural
labor-management
relations
has
been
much
greater
than
in
the
past
.
The
AWOC
has
been
able
to
employ
the
traditional
weapons
of
labor
--
the
strike
and
the
picket
line
--
with
considerable
success
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
wages
.
By
the
very
nature
of
the
situation
,
it
is
the
union
which
has
been
able
to
select
the
time
and
place
to
bring
pressure
upon
management
.
To
date
,
at
least
,
the
strategy
of
the
AWOC
has
been
selective
;
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
concentrate
on
a
particular
crop
or
activity
in
a
particular
area
at
a
strategic
time
,
rather
than
any
broadside
engagement
with
management
throughout
an
area
or
the
State
.
Primarily
,
we
became
involved
in
these
disputes
because
of
our
referral
obligations
under
our
farm
placement
program
.
Normally
,
because
agricultural
labor
is
not
covered
by
unemployment
insurance
,
we
would
not
expect
any
issues
to
arise
regarding
benefit
payments
under
the
trade
dispute
provision
of
the
Unemployment
Insurance
Code
,
although
such
a
situation
is
quite
within
the
realm
of
possibility
.
But
the
current
issues
arose
out
of
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
concerning
referrals
to
an
establishment
where
a
labor
dispute
exists
,
and
out
of
Public
Law
78
and
the
Migrant
Labor
Agreement
if
Mexican
nationals
were
employed
at
the
ranch
.
Most
of
us
remember
and
think
of
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
in
its
historical
sense
,
as
a
major
milestone
in
the
development
of
public
placement
services
.
Infrequently
do
we
think
of
it
as
a
living
,
continuing
,
operating
control
over
the
system
.
However
,
when
labor
disputes
arise
,
its
provisions
come
clearly
into
play
.
California
has
accepted
the
provisions
of
that
Act
(
as
have
all
other
States
)
by
enacting
into
our
Code
(
Section
2051
)
a
provision
that
The
State
of
California
accepts
the
provisions
of
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
,
and
will
observe
and
comply
with
the
requirements
of
that
act
.
With
respect
to
labor
disputes
,
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
states
only
,
In
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
Act
,
the
Secretary
is
authorized
and
directed
to
provide
for
the
giving
of
notice
of
strikes
or
lock-outs
to
applicants
before
they
are
referred
to
employment
.
Other
provisions
of
the
Act
empower
the
Secretary
to
adopt
regulations
necessary
to
carry
out
its
provisions
,
and
he
has
done
so
.
The
pertinent
regulation
for
our
purposes
is
Section
602.2
(
,
)
,
as
follows
:
Referrals
in
labor
dispute
situations
.
No
person
shall
be
referred
to
a
position
the
filling
of
which
will
aid
directly
or
indirectly
in
filling
a
job
which
(
1
)
is
vacant
because
the
former
occupant
is
on
strike
or
is
being
locked
out
in
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute
,
or
(
2
)
the
filling
of
which
is
an
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
.
With
respect
to
positions
not
covered
by
subparagraph
(
1
)
or
(
2
)
of
this
paragraph
,
any
individual
may
be
referred
to
a
place
of
employment
in
which
a
labor
dispute
exists
,
provided
he
is
given
written
notice
of
such
dispute
prior
to
or
at
the
time
of
his
referral
.
In
analyzing
this
regulation
,
let
us
take
the
last
sentence
first
.
It
permits
referrals
under
certain
circumstances
even
when
there
is
a
labor
dispute
,
provided
the
individual
is
given
written
notice
of
such
a
dispute
.
Assume
,
for
example
,
a
situation
where
a
farm
has
a
packing
shed
and
fields
.
The
packing
shed
workers
go
on
strike
.
There
is
no
dispute
involving
fieldwork
.
We
concluded
that
we
may
refer
workers
to
the
fieldwork
(
but
not
the
packing
shed
work
)
provided
we
give
them
written
notice
of
the
packing
shed
dispute
.
So
far
,
no
troublesome
cases
have
arisen
under
this
provision
.
It
is
the
first
part
of
the
Regulation
that
is
currently
at
issue
.
Note
that
it
prohibits
referrals
under
either
condition
(
1
)
or
condition
(
2
)
.
Employer
representatives
have
contended
that
the
Secretary
has
gone
beyond
his
authority
by
such
a
prohibition
,
on
the
grounds
that
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
requires
only
written
notice
to
the
prospective
worker
that
a
dispute
exists
.
Into
court
The
matter
got
into
the
courts
this
way
:
One
of
the
early
strikes
called
by
the
AWOC
was
at
the
DiGiorgio
pear
orchards
in
Yuba
County
.
We
found
that
a
labor
dispute
existed
,
and
that
the
workers
had
left
their
jobs
,
which
were
then
vacant
because
of
the
dispute
.
Accordingly
,
under
clause
(
1
)
of
the
Secretary's
Regulation
,
we
suspended
referrals
to
the
employer
.
(
Incidentally
,
no
Mexican
nationals
were
involved
.
)
The
employer
,
seeking
to
continue
his
harvest
,
challenged
our
right
to
cease
referrals
to
him
,
and
sought
relief
in
the
Superior
Court
of
Yuba
County
.
The
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
,
directing
us
to
resume
referrals
.
We
,
of
course
,
obeyed
the
court
order
.
However
,
the
Attorney
General
of
California
,
at
the
request
of
the
Secretary
of
Labor
,
sought
to
have
the
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
removed
to
the
Federal
District
Court
,
on
grounds
that
it
was
predominantly
a
Federal
issue
since
the
validity
of
the
Secretary's
Regulation
was
being
challenged
.
However
,
the
Federal
Court
held
that
since
the
State
had
accepted
the
provisions
of
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
into
its
own
Code
,
and
presumably
therefore
also
the
regulations
,
it
was
now
a
State
matter
.
It
accordingly
refused
to
assume
jurisdiction
,
whereupon
the
California
Superior
Court
made
the
restraining
order
permanent
.
Under
that
order
,
we
have
continued
referring
workers
to
the
ranch
.
A
similar
case
arose
at
the
Bowers
ranch
in
Butte
County
,
and
the
Superior
Court
of
that
county
issued
similar
restraining
orders
.
The
growers
have
strenuously
argued
that
I
should
have
accepted
the
Superior
Court
decisions
as
conclusive
and
issued
statewide
instructions
to
our
staff
to
ignore
this
provision
in
the
Secretary's
Regulation
.
I
cannot
accept
that
view
,
either
as
a
lawyer
or
as
an
administrator
.
Legal
considerations
First
,
let
us
examine
briefly
some
of
the
legal
considerations
involved
.
It
is
an
accepted
juridical
principle
in
California
that
a
Superior
Court
decision
does
not
constitute
a
binding
legal
precedent
.
It
is
conclusive
,
unless
appealed
,
only
upon
the
particular
parties
to
the
particular
action
which
was
heard
.
It
is
not
binding
upon
another
Superior
Court
,
which
could
rule
to
the
contrary
.
Only
when
a
decision
is
rendered
by
the
District
Court
of
Appeal
(
or
,
of
course
,
the
Supreme
Court
)
is
a
binding
precedent
established
.
In
that
event
,
we
can
correctly
say
that
we
have
received
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
matter
,
and
one
which
we
can
follow
statewide
with
confidence
that
the
policy
will
not
be
overthrown
in
other
Superior
Courts
.
But
over
and
beyond
the
compelling
need
for
a
binding
precedent
decision
,
I
am
convinced
that
the
decisions
of
the
Superior
Courts
which
in
effect
nullify
the
Secretary's
Regulation
are
not
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
Secretary's
power
under
the
Federal
law
.
I
believe
I
am
in
good
company
in
this
view
.
The
Attorney
General
of
California
concurs
in
this
interpretation
and
has
filed
an
appeal
from
these
decisions
to
the
District
Court
of
Appeal
.
The
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
,
in
considering
the
power
of
the
Secretary
to
issue
similar
regulations
under
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
relating
to
the
interstate
recruitment
of
farm
workers
,
has
rendered
an
opinion
sustaining
his
authority
.
Further
,
and
as
an
evidence
of
legislative
intent
only
,
the
Senate
of
the
United
States
recently
defeated
by
a
substantial
majority
the
``
Holland
Amendment
''
to
the
Fair
Labor
Standards
Act
,
which
would
have
specifically
limited
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
Secretary
in
these
matters
.
Next
,
let
us
consider
briefly
the
program
and
administrative
implications
of
a
failure
on
our
part
to
pursue
our
appeals
.
There
is
far
too
much
at
stake
for
all
of
the
parties
concerned
to
leave
the
matter
hanging
in
midair
.
The
ramifications
of
the
issue
are
enormous
.
A
decision
to
refer
workers
to
jobs
vacant
because
of
a
strike
would
have
to
be
applied
equally
to
nonagricultural
situations
,
and
might
in
effect
place
the
public
employment
services
in
the
position
of
acting
as
strikebreakers
.
The
public
interest
is
so
dominant
in
such
an
issue
that
I
cannot
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
attempt
to
settle
it
by
an
administrative
order
based
upon
conclusions
reached
in
a
summary
action
in
one
or
two
Superior
Courts
in
the
State
.
It
is
an
issue
which
may
well
reach
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
before
judicial
finality
is
achieved
.
As
an
administrator
,
I
cannot
place
the
Employment
Service
in
California
in
jeopardy
of
being
out
of
compliance
with
the
Federal
laws
by
my
failure
to
pursue
the
avenues
of
appeal
open
to
me
.
To
have
applied
statewide
the
decisions
of
the
two
cases
heard
in
Superior
Court
,
in
my
opinion
,
would
have
placed
us
clearly
out
of
compliance
with
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
and
would
have
immediately
opened
the
way
for
the
Secretary
of
Labor
,
were
he
so
inclined
,
to
notify
the
Governor
of
such
noncompliance
,
set
a
date
for
hearing
,
and
issue
his
finding
.
The
impact
of
noncompliance
under
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
is
clear
:
the
withdrawal
of
some
$11
million
a
year
of
administrative
funds
which
finance
our
employment
service
program
or
,
as
a
corollary
,
the
taking
over
by
the
Federal
Government
of
its
operation
.
Thus
far
,
the
cases
which
have
come
before
the
courts
have
involved
only
the
issue
of
referral
where
the
job
is
vacant
due
to
a
strike
--
condition
(
1
)
in
the
Regulation
of
the
Secretary
.
None
has
yet
arisen
under
condition
(
2
)
,
relating
to
referral
to
jobs
``
the
filling
of
which
is
an
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
''
.
Here
the
problem
is
essentially
one
of
defining
the
word
``
filling
''
.
Should
it
be
defined
in
a
narrow
sense
to
include
only
such
elements
as
job
specifications
,
union
membership
,
union
jurisdiction
,
and
the
like
?
?
Or
should
it
have
a
broader
connotation
of
including
wage
demands
and
other
factors
not
necessarily
associated
with
the
mechanics
of
``
filling
''
the
job
.
Because
of
the
uncertainty
of
this
definition
,
I
solicited
the
interpretation
of
the
Secretary
of
Labor
.
He
has
advised
me
that
the
narrower
interpretation
is
the
proper
one
;
;
that
is
,
that
if
wages
,
for
example
,
is
the
only
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
,
and
no
workers
have
left
their
jobs
because
of
the
dispute
,
we
may
continue
to
make
referrals
.

.
Martin
and
Stendler
present
evidence
that
infants
and
young
children
can
and
do
solve
many
problems
at
a
relatively
simple
perceptual
level
simply
by
combining
objects
and
counting
them
.
After
they
have
developed
concepts
,
they
are
free
from
the
necessity
of
manipulating
objects
;
;
they
do
symbolically
what
they
once
had
to
do
concretely
.
The
ability
to
think
seems
to
increase
consistently
with
age
.
One
experiment
showed
the
greatest
one-year
difference
occurring
between
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
years
.
10
.
Many
studies
indicate
that
elementary-school
children's
interests
cover
the
whole
field
of
science
;
;
that
their
questions
indicate
a
genuine
interest
in
social
processes
and
events
;
;
and
that
as
they
mature
their
interests
and
capabilities
change
and
broaden
.
Emotional
characteristics
How
a
child
feels
about
himself
,
about
other
people
,
and
about
the
tasks
confronting
him
in
school
may
have
as
much
influence
on
his
success
in
school
as
his
physical
and
intellectual
characteristics
.
A
considerable
amount
of
evidence
exists
to
show
that
an
unhappy
and
insecure
child
is
not
likely
to
do
well
in
school
subjects
.
Emotional
maturity
is
the
result
of
many
factors
,
the
principal
ones
being
the
experiences
of
the
first
few
years
of
the
child's
life
.
However
,
the
teacher
who
understands
the
influence
of
emotions
on
behavior
may
be
highly
influential
in
helping
pupils
gain
confidence
,
security
,
and
satisfaction
.
Concerning
this
responsibility
of
the
teacher
,
suggestions
for
helping
children
gain
better
control
of
the
emotions
are
presented
in
Chapter
11
.
The
following
generalizations
about
the
emotional
characteristics
of
elementary-school
children
may
be
helpful
.
1
.
Typically
,
the
young
child's
emotional
reactions
last
for
a
relatively
short
time
,
as
contrasted
to
those
of
an
adult
.
2
.
As
the
child
grows
older
,
his
emotional
reactions
lead
to
``
moods
''
,
or
emotional
states
drawn
out
over
a
period
of
time
and
expressed
slowly
,
rather
than
in
short
,
abrupt
outbursts
.
3
.
Studies
of
the
growth
and
decline
of
children's
fears
indicate
that
fears
due
to
strange
objects
,
noises
,
falling
,
and
unexpected
movement
decline
during
the
preschool
years
,
but
that
fears
of
the
dark
,
of
being
alone
,
and
of
imaginary
creatures
or
robbers
increase
.
4
.
Ridiculing
a
child
for
being
afraid
or
forcing
him
to
meet
the
feared
situation
alone
are
poor
ways
of
dealing
with
the
problem
;
;
more
effective
solutions
include
explanations
,
the
example
of
another
child
,
or
conditioning
by
associating
the
feared
object
,
place
,
or
person
with
something
pleasant
.
5
.
Children
need
help
in
learning
to
control
their
emotions
.
The
young
child
learns
from
parents
and
teachers
that
temper
tantrums
,
screaming
,
kicking
,
and
hitting
will
not
get
him
what
he
wants
;
;
the
older
child
learns
that
intense
emotional
outbursts
will
not
win
approval
by
his
peers
,
and
,
therefore
,
makes
a
real
effort
to
control
his
emotions
.
6
.
Children
differ
widely
in
their
emotional
responses
.
Among
infants
the
patterns
of
emotional
responses
are
similar
;
;
as
the
influence
of
learning
and
environment
are
felt
,
emotional
behavior
becomes
individualized
.
Social
characteristics
Although
no
national
norms
exist
for
the
social
development
of
children
,
the
teacher
can
find
a
great
deal
of
information
concerning
types
of
social
behavior
normally
displayed
by
children
at
various
age
levels
.
The
following
summary
will
give
the
student
some
idea
about
the
social
characteristics
of
elementary-school
children
;
;
the
student
will
certainly
want
to
explore
more
deeply
into
the
fascinating
study
of
immature
individuals
,
struggling
to
meet
their
developmental
needs
,
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
learn
the
rules
of
the
game
in
the
ever-expanding
number
of
groups
in
which
they
hold
membership
.
1
.
During
early
childhood
,
children
are
more
interested
in
the
approval
of
their
parents
and
teachers
than
they
are
in
the
approval
of
other
children
;
;
after
they
have
been
in
school
a
few
years
,
their
interest
in
playmates
of
their
own
age
increases
,
and
their
interest
in
adults
decreases
;
;
the
child
who
had
once
considered
it
a
treat
to
accompany
his
parents
on
picnics
and
family
gatherings
now
considers
it
a
bore
.
In
late
childhood
the
influence
of
the
group
on
the
social
behavior
of
the
child
continues
to
increase
;
;
the
group
sets
the
styles
in
clothing
,
the
kind
of
play
engaged
in
,
and
the
ideals
of
right
and
wrong
behavior
.
2
.
In
early
childhood
the
choice
of
a
companion
is
likely
to
be
for
another
child
of
his
own
age
or
a
year
or
two
older
,
who
can
do
the
things
he
likes
to
do
;
;
such
factors
as
sex
,
intelligence
,
and
status
in
the
group
do
not
influence
his
choice
much
at
this
time
.
3
.
In
later
childhood
,
an
interest
in
team
games
replaces
individual
play
;
;
loyalty
to
the
group
,
a
feeling
of
superiority
over
those
who
are
not
members
,
and
unwillingness
to
play
with
members
of
the
opposite
sex
become
dominant
traits
.
4
.
During
early
childhood
boys
tease
and
bully
,
on
the
average
,
more
than
girls
;
;
those
who
feel
inferior
or
insecure
engage
in
these
activities
more
than
do
well-adjusted
children
.
5
.
During
late
childhood
boys
like
to
tease
,
jostle
,
and
talk
smart
to
girls
;
;
girls
,
who
are
more
mature
than
boys
,
frown
upon
the
youthful
antics
of
boys
of
their
own
age
.
6
.
By
the
time
pupils
reach
the
sixth
grade
,
their
ethical
and
moral
standards
are
fairly
well
developed
;
;
they
exhibit
a
keen
interest
in
social
,
political
,
and
economic
problems
,
but
they
frequently
have
vague
and
incorrect
notions
about
the
terms
they
use
rather
glibly
in
their
routine
school
work
.
7
.
Between
the
ages
of
two
and
four
years
,
negativism
or
resistance
to
adult
authority
is
noticeable
;
;
after
the
fourth
year
it
begins
to
decline
.
However
,
as
we
have
seen
,
in
later
childhood
the
child
begins
to
substitute
the
standards
of
the
peer
group
for
those
of
parents
and
teachers
.
8
.
The
elementary-school
child
grows
gradually
in
his
ability
to
work
in
groups
.
The
child
in
the
primary
grades
can
play
harmoniously
with
one
companion
,
but
his
desire
to
be
first
in
everything
gets
him
into
trouble
when
the
group
gets
larger
;
;
he
wants
to
be
with
people
,
but
he
hasn't
yet
learned
to
cooperate
.
In
the
middle
grades
,
however
,
he
begins
to
participate
more
effectively
in
group
activities
such
as
selecting
a
leader
,
helping
to
make
plans
and
carry
on
group
activities
,
and
setting
up
rules
governing
the
enterprise
.
Why
the
teacher
should
study
the
individual
pupil
Much
progress
has
been
made
in
the
last
two
decades
in
developing
techniques
for
understanding
children
,
yet
in
almost
any
classroom
today
can
be
found
children
whose
needs
are
not
being
met
by
the
school
program
.
Some
are
failing
to
achieve
as
much
as
their
ability
would
permit
;
;
others
never
seem
able
to
enter
fully
into
the
life
of
the
classroom
.
These
children
have
been
described
as
those
who
were
trying
to
say
something
to
adults
who
did
not
understand
.
Many
school
systems
now
employ
school
psychologists
and
child
guidance
specialists
.
These
specialists
perform
valuable
services
by
helping
teachers
learn
to
identify
children
who
need
special
attention
,
by
suggesting
ways
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individual
children
in
the
regular
classroom
,
and
by
providing
clinical
services
for
severely
maladjusted
children
.
It
is
the
classroom
teacher
,
however
,
who
has
daily
contacts
with
pupils
,
and
who
is
in
a
unique
position
to
put
sound
psychological
principles
into
practice
.
Indeed
,
a
study
of
the
individual
child
is
an
integral
part
of
the
work
of
the
elementary-school
teacher
,
rather
than
merely
an
additional
chore
.
Teachers
and
administrators
in
many
elementary
schools
have
assumed
that
dividing
the
pupils
in
any
grade
into
groups
on
the
basis
of
test
scores
solves
the
problem
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individuals
.
What
they
should
recognize
is
that
children
who
have
been
placed
in
one
of
these
groups
on
a
narrow
academic
basis
still
differ
widely
in
attributes
that
influence
success
,
and
that
they
still
must
be
treated
as
individuals
.
Although
the
teacher
must
be
concerned
with
maintaining
standards
,
he
must
also
be
concerned
about
understanding
differences
in
ability
,
background
,
and
experience
.
Factors
that
inhibit
learning
and
lead
to
maladjustment
Studies
conducted
in
various
sections
of
the
United
States
indicate
that
many
children
in
elementary
schools
are
maladjusted
emotionally
,
and
that
many
of
them
are
failing
to
make
satisfactory
progress
in
school
subjects
.
One
study
,
which
involved
1,524
pupils
in
grades
one
to
six
,
found
that
12
percent
of
the
pupils
were
seriously
maladjusted
and
that
23
percent
were
reading
a
year
below
capacity
.
It
is
apparent
,
therefore
,
that
the
teacher
needs
to
know
what
factors
have
a
vital
bearing
on
the
learning
and
adjustment
of
children
.
When
a
child
fails
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
school
in
his
rate
of
learning
,
insecurity
,
unhappiness
,
and
other
forms
of
maladjustment
frequently
follow
.
These
maladjustments
in
turn
inhibit
learning
,
and
a
vicious
cycle
is
completed
.
It
is
easy
for
the
teacher
to
rationalize
that
the
child
who
is
not
achieving
in
accordance
with
his
known
ability
is
just
plain
lazy
,
or
that
the
child
who
lacks
interest
in
school
,
who
dislikes
the
teacher
,
or
who
is
overaggressive
is
a
hopeless
delinquent
.
The
causes
of
retardation
and
maladjustment
may
be
found
in
physical
factors
,
such
as
defective
speech
or
hearing
,
impaired
vision
,
faulty
motor
coordination
,
a
frail
constitution
,
chronic
disease
,
malnutrition
,
and
glandular
malfunctioning
.
They
may
be
caused
by
poor
health
habits
,
such
as
faulty
eating
and
sleeping
habits
.
They
may
be
related
to
mental
immaturity
or
lack
of
aptitude
for
certain
types
of
school
work
.
The
curriculum
may
be
too
difficult
for
some
and
too
easy
for
others
.
Teaching
methods
,
learning
materials
,
and
promotion
policies
may
inhibit
learning
and
lead
to
maladjustments
for
some
children
.
Unwholesome
family
relations
,
broken
homes
,
and
undesirable
community
influences
may
also
be
contributing
factors
.
This
is
only
a
minimum
list
of
the
factors
that
inhibit
learning
and
contribute
to
maladjustment
among
children
.
Moreover
,
these
conditions
do
not
influence
all
children
in
the
same
manner
.
A
vision
handicap
that
may
produce
nervous
tension
and
reading
disability
for
one
child
may
spur
another
child
on
to
even
greater
achievement
in
reading
.
An
impoverished
home
that
may
discourage
one
child
may
constitute
the
motivation
causing
another
to
work
harder
for
successful
achievement
in
school
.
At
any
rate
,
the
teacher
who
recognizes
common
causes
of
retardation
and
maladjustment
can
frequently
do
a
great
deal
to
eliminate
the
causes
of
pupil
discouragement
,
failure
,
and
maladjustment
.
Sources
of
information
about
children
Successful
teaching
involves
getting
enough
information
about
each
pupil
to
understand
why
he
behaves
as
he
does
in
certain
situations
and
how
his
achievement
in
school
is
being
influenced
by
various
factors
in
his
environment
.
The
classroom
teacher
cannot
be
expected
to
be
as
proficient
in
the
use
of
the
techniques
of
child
study
as
the
clinical
psychologist
;
;
he
cannot
be
expected
to
administer
all
the
tests
and
gather
all
the
information
needed
about
each
child
in
his
classroom
.
He
can
be
expected
,
however
,
to
examine
and
interpret
the
information
already
available
;
;
to
refine
and
extend
his
own
techniques
for
studying
individual
children
;
;
and
to
utilize
opportunities
,
arising
in
connection
with
regular
classroom
activities
,
for
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
his
pupils
.
This
section
deals
with
some
of
the
sources
of
information
that
can
be
tapped
by
the
classroom
teacher
;
;
Chapter
15
provides
more
detailed
information
about
specific
techniques
used
in
evaluating
pupil
progress
.
Cumulative
records
Most
school
systems
today
maintain
a
system
of
cumulative
records
of
pupils
.
These
records
,
when
systematically
maintained
,
provide
much
information
about
the
children
,
which
the
teacher
can
use
in
guidance
,
instruction
,
grouping
,
and
reporting
to
parents
.
Each
teacher
has
in
his
classroom
a
metal
file
,
equipped
with
a
lock
,
which
is
used
to
store
cumulative
record
folders
.
During
summer
vacation
periods
these
records
are
stored
in
the
office
of
the
principal
.
Only
the
teacher
and
other
professional
personnel
are
permitted
to
see
or
use
these
records
.
Each
new
teacher
to
whom
the
pupil
goes
is
expected
to
study
the
information
in
the
cumulative
record
and
to
bring
it
up
to
date
.
Some
school
systems
provide
written
instructions
to
principals
and
teachers
designating
when
certain
information
is
to
be
recorded
on
cumulative
record
forms
and
explaining
how
the
information
is
to
be
summarized
and
used
.
The
Summary
Report
On
Desegregation
Progress
In
Education
In
The
Middle-South
Region
,
1959
-
1960
''
clearly
shows
two
pieces
of
information
.
The
Summary
Report
,
which
was
prepared
for
this
Conference
,
indicates
,
first
,
that
actual
or
pending
school
desegregation
is
increasing
;
;
second
,
that
both
actual
and
pending
desegregation
is
,
with
few
exceptions
,
the
product
or
result
of
court
order
.
The
Report
together
with
other
information
suggests
that
desegregation
in
the
schools
is
slow
.
The
Middle-South
Region
,
as
defined
by
the
National
Association
of
Intergroup
Relations
Officials
(
NAIRO
)
,
consists
of
the
states
of
Kentucky
,
Maryland
,
Tennessee
,
West
Virginia
,
Delaware
,
Virginia
and
the
District
of
Columbia
.
The
states
and
the
Nation's
Capital
all
have
some
desegregation
,
in
fact
some
dating
back
to
1954
;
;
but
the
region
also
embraces
some
of
the
staunchest
opposition
.
Desegregation
has
been
opposed
by
massive
resistance
,
interposition
,
pupil
assignment
(
with
no
assignments
of
Negro
children
)
,
and
hate
bombings
.
Desegregation
and
court
order
Now
let's
look
at
the
evidence
that
shows
the
increase
in
desegregation
and
such
increase
as
a
result
of
court
order
.
First
Kentucky
.
Elementary
school
desegregation
came
to
Owen
and
Union
Counties
,
which
already
had
high
school
desegregation
.
The
action
was
a
result
of
a
court
order
,
the
citation
for
which
(
and
for
other
court
action
mentioned
in
this
paper
)
is
taken
from
the
Summary
Report
for
this
Conference
.
In
Maryland
the
Harford
County
Board
of
Education
had
prepared
a
desegregation
plan
which
the
Court
approved
but
which
a
plaintiff
had
challenged
;
;
thus
,
county
school
board
and
Federal
court
joined
hands
here
to
promote
school
desegregation
.
Additional
school
desegregation
in
Tennessee
resulted
from
a
court
order
opening
a
school
serving
children
of
military
personnel
.
Similarly
,
further
desegregation
may
come
from
suits
pending
in
three
Tennessee
cities
,
Chattanooga
,
Knoxville
,
and
Memphis
.
In
West
Virginia
the
number
of
white
and
Negro
children
attending
the
same
school
has
increased
almost
twofold
.
There
are
no
court
decisions
here
.
As
in
Maryland
,
a
District
court
has
approved
an
official
plan
of
school
desegregation
in
Delaware
.
As
a
result
of
the
State
Board
of
Education
plan
,
Negro
children
entered
heretofore
white
elementary
schools
in
five
districts
.
The
Third
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
is
reviewing
an
appeal
from
the
plan
.
In
Virginia
court
orders
led
to
desegregation
in
Charlottesville
and
Floyd
Counties
.
Desegregation
in
Pulaski
County
is
pending
because
of
court
order
,
although
date
of
admission
is
not
yet
determined
.
Negro
parents
have
filed
application
for
admission
of
additional
children
to
schools
in
Alexandria
,
Arlington
,
Fairfax
,
and
Warren
Counties
.
Desegregation
can
also
result
from
additional
suits
brought
by
Negro
plaintiffs
against
school
boards
in
Newport
News
,
Fairfax
County
,
Arlington
County
,
and
Norfolk
.
As
a
school
district
,
the
District
of
Columbia
has
had
desegregated
schools
since
1954
,
shortly
after
the
Supreme
Court
decision
.
This
recapitulation
makes
it
clear
that
school
desegregation
continues
,
including
the
Old
Dominion
State
,
in
spite
of
its
stern
resistance
.
The
record
is
clear
that
increase
in
school
desegregation
last
year
came
largely
as
a
result
of
a
court
order
;
;
that
on
the
immediate
horizon
,
if
further
large-scale
(
relatively
speaking
)
desegregation
comes
,
it
will
result
from
court
orders
on
suits
filed
in
several
Middle-South
states
.
Knowledge
that
thousands
of
school
districts
are
involved
and
observation
that
school
desegregation
has
occurred
in
only
a
handful
in
1959-1960
leads
to
a
conclusion
that
desegregation-from-court-order
is
slow
.
Before
turning
to
my
views
as
to
the
problems
and
issues
before
us
at
this
Regional
Conference
,
I
wish
to
note
a
small
item
in
the
Summary
Report
as
it
refers
to
the
District
of
Columbia
.
That
reference
in
the
Report
is
``
continuation
of
the
trend
toward
an
all-Negro
school
system
''
,
a
remark
apparently
occasioned
by
the
increase
of
Negro
school
population
from
74.1
per
cent
to
76.7
per
cent
.
I
see
no
real
prospects
for
an
all-Negro
school
population
.
West
of
Rock
Creek
Park
is
still
monolithically
white
and
is
in
fact
increasingly
white
as
a
result
of
Georgetown's
conversion-by-renovation
housing
program
.
Nearby
Foggy
Bottom
is
ousting
Negroes
.
The
large
acreage
in
the
Southwest
Redevelopment
area
beckons
white
people
--
what
with
high-priced
town
houses
and
elevator
apartments
.
The
Capitol
Hill
rehabilitation
,
like
Foggy
Bottom
,
replaces
Negroes
with
whites
(
but
also
replaces
some
whites
with
other
whites
)
.
The
sharpest
break
with
tradition
,
the
past
and
present
of
``
White
Ring
Around
a
Black
Core
''
,
may
come
with
the
opening
of
nearby
Montgomery
County
suburbs
to
Negro
residents
and
,
presumably
,
the
consequent
conclusion
of
some
whites
that
they
cannot
escape
the
Negro
by
fleeing
to
the
suburbs
.
In
fact
,
short
of
fleeing
to
Warrenton
,
Virginia
,
or
Rockville
,
Maryland
,
white
people
may
have
to
live
with
Negroes
.
All
of
this
must
be
taken
into
account
before
the
image
of
an
``
all-Negro
''
D.C.
public
school
system
is
conjured
up
.
Problems
to
solve
From
the
Summary
Report
before
us
at
this
Conference
,
a
number
of
problems
are
apparent
.
They
vex
us
and
perplex
us
but
generally
do
not
divide
us
like
the
issues
which
follow
the
problems
.
First
,
how
can
we
step
up
the
desegregation
movement
?
?
It
is
slow
.
I
believe
we
all
want
more
schools
where
white
and
Negro
together
can
and
do
attend
.
I
believe
we
all
want
no
child
denied
admission
to
a
school
on
account
of
his
color
.
In
general
,
members
of
NAIRO
would
certainly
want
a
child
admitted
to
a
school
nearest
his
residence
or
within
his
residence
zone
.
How
to
achieve
this
objective
is
a
problem
,
but
we
are
not
divided
on
what
we
want
.
Second
,
as
we
increase
the
number
of
desegregated
school
districts
and
schools
themselves
,
how
can
we
achieve
this
action
through
school
board
action
?
?
It
may
be
county
school
board
or
state
school
board
action
,
as
well
as
that
of
municipal
school
boards
.
Correlatively
,
can
we
reduce
the
role
of
the
district
courts
,
so
that
the
action
is
that
of
the
people
of
the
community
or
other
school
district
and
not
that
of
the
law
court
?
?
This
is
a
problem
,
and
I
believe
there
is
little
difference
of
opinion
that
wherever
possible
a
local
school
board
should
devise
and
effect
a
plan
of
desegregation
.
Third
,
how
can
we
insure
a
systematic
and
continuing
group
relations
education
in
the
schools
?
?
Not
simply
a
brief
program
when
the
schools
are
actually
desegregated
but
a
continuing
program
that
also
promotes
integration
,
that
encourages
the
children
and
teachers
not
to
look
at
each
other
as
white
or
Negro
,
but
as
human
beings
.
Again
the
problem
is
how
to
get
it
done
and
in
what
form
to
offer
the
group
relations
education
;
;
not
whether
it
should
be
done
.
Fourth
,
in
the
segregated
school
system
,
during
the
period
before
desegregation
,
how
can
we
assure
equal
opportunity
?
?
In
fact
,
in
the
desegregated
school
system
which
may
have
a
good
many
schools
with
all-Negro
population
,
how
can
we
assure
equal
opportunity
?
?
This
is
a
problem
,
but
we
are
not
divided
over
its
importance
or
by
its
existence
.
Fifth
,
in
the
segregated
school
system
or
in
the
all-Negro
or
all-white
schools
,
how
can
we
encourage
better
group
relations
or
an
improved
attitude
toward
people
who
do
not
belong
to
the
group
?
?
Can
we
help
children
adjust
to
``
images
of
other
children
''
when
the
latter
are
not
actually
present
.
Now
,
the
issues
If
we
have
five
problems
whose
solution
we
seek
in
relatively
united
fashion
,
then
there
are
twice
as
many
issues
which
,
I
judge
,
sharply
divide
us
,
intergroup
relations
practitioners
and
lay
people
.
Issue
no.

.
Pupil
assignment
.
Since
on
the
one
hand
school
desegregation
has
come
in
Virginia
hand-in-glove
with
pupil
assignment
,
shall
we
support
the
plan
?
?
On
the
basis
of
pupil
assignment
criteria
,
Judge
Albert
Bryan
has
assigned
Negro
children
to
formerly
white
schools
in
Arlington
and
Alexandria
,
Virginia
.
Shall
we
support
pupil
assignment
?
?
On
the
other
hand
,
looking
at
the
larger
picture
,
is
it
true
that
pupil
assignment
has
effectively
cut
off
,
blocked
,
or
reduced
school
desegregation
to
a
``
trickle
''
?
?
Shall
we
therefore
oppose
the
plan
?
?
This
question
is
an
issue
because
it
likely
divides
us
into
two
camps
--
those
for
or
against
pupil
assignment
.
Issue
no.
2
.
Teacher
assignment
in
order
to
desegregate
.
In
large
cities
like
Baltimore
,
Louisville
,
and
Washington
,
D.C.
,
should
school
desegregation
be
extended
to
all-Negro
and
all-white
schools
by
assigning
white
and
Negro
teachers
,
respectively
?
?
On
the
one
hand
do
we
argue
the
Supreme
Court
decision
required
only
that
a
child
not
be
denied
admission
to
a
school
on
account
of
his
race
?
?
Or
should
we
argue
that
if
we
want
adjustment
of
children
to
children
of
different
races
and
that
that
is
impossible
in
an
all-something-or-the-other
school
,
we
must
at
least
provide
him
some
opportunity
to
adjust
to
people
of
another
race
within
the
school
--
namely
,
to
a
teacher
of
another
race
.
We
can
argue
that
where
residence
makes
pupil
desegregation
impossible
teacher
assignment
can
create
a
partially
desegregated
situation
.
Issue
no.
3
.
The
plaintiff
in
school
desegregation
cases
.
The
earlier
part
of
my
statement
deals
with
the
court
orders
that
resulted
in
desegregation
.
In
each
instance
the
plaintiff
was
a
private
citizen
.
In
thousands
of
school
districts
,
indeed
,
in
the
entire
State
of
Mississippi
,
no
plaintiff
has
come
forth
.
And
I
have
established
that
the
action
of
municipal
,
county
,
or
state
school
boards
or
boards
of
education
is
small
,
infinitesimally
small
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
districts
.
Is
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
person
actually
denied
admission
to
a
school
a
sound
requirement
?
?
Should
Congress
authorize
the
Attorney
General
to
file
suit
to
accomplish
admission
of
a
child
to
a
school
to
which
he
is
denied
entrance
?
?
Even
though
in
civil
rights
legislation
in
1957
and
1960
the
provision
for
the
Attorney
General
to
act
was
eliminated
,
should
we
nevertheless
support
such
a
clause
?
?
This
is
an
issue
,
for
it
divides
people
rather
sharply
.
Issue
no.
4
.
Withholding
of
funds
to
schools
that
deny
children
on
account
of
race
.
This
is
the
Powell
Amendment
,
which
in
1957
divided
even
a
``
liberal
''
group
like
the
American
Veterans
Committee
(
AVC
)
.
Should
we
support
a
clause
in
Federal
school
construction
or
school
assistance
legislation
that
would
deny
Federal
funds
to
a
school
district
that
denies
admission
to
a
child
on
account
of
his
race
?
?
This
is
softer
than
earlier
Powell
amendments
which
would
have
denied
funds
to
all
segregated
school
districts
.
There
is
nonetheless
considerable
argument
against
the
clause
,
softened
though
it
be
,
on
the
grounds
that
Federal
aid
is
so
necessary
to
the
public
schools
.
The
Federal
funds
limitation
enlists
the
support
of
many
,
the
opposition
of
quite
a
few
.
Issue
no.
5
.
Required
public
education
.
Should
a
political
subdivision
,
state
or
county
or
municipality
,
be
required
to
furnish
public
education
?
?
For
the
school
year
,
1959-1960
,
the
Prince
Edward
County
(
Virginia
)
Board
of
Supervisors
voted
not
to
provide
funds
for
public
education
,
and
the
school
board
therefore
could
provide
no
public
education
--
for
white
or
Negro
children
.
Is
public
education
in
this
American
democracy
of
such
importance
that
no
child
should
be
denied
public
education
?
?
Or
is
this
subject
a
matter
of
self-determination
,
a
matter
of
states
rights
or
county
rights
?
?
If
people
don't
want
to
provide
public
education
,
should
they
be
forced
to
do
so
?
?
Even
if
we
marshal
substantial
agreement
behind
mandatory
public
education
,
we
likely
cannot
expect
that
all
the
states
will
enact
the
legislation
.
Should
the
requirement
,
which
must
therefore
be
Federal
in
nature
,
be
legislated
by
the
United
States
Congress
?
?
Or
must
it
become
law
by
amendment
of
the
United
States
Constitution
?
?
We
actually
have
two
issues
in
this
question
--
goal
and
method
.
Issue
no.
6
.
Federal
responsibility
for
education
of
the
citizens
.
If
the
above
issue
is
settled
by
requiring
public
education
for
all
citizens
,
Issue
No.
6
may
be
moot
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
not
settled
,
or
while
it
is
being
debated
and
resolved
,
does
the
Federal
government
have
a
responsibility
in
situations
like
that
in
Prince
Edward
County
?
?
Nearly
half
the
children
still
receive
no
education
.
Must
or
should
the
Federal
government
help
?
?
Should
the
government
directly
provide
education
for
the
children
who
want
public
education
?
?
The
next
question
is
whether
board
members
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
their
roles
as
educational
policy-makers
.
On
the
whole
,
it
appears
that
they
do
not
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
an
explicit
way
.
Seldom
is
there
an
issue
in
which
class
lines
can
be
clearly
drawn
.
A
hypothetical
issue
of
this
sort
might
deal
with
the
establishment
of
a
free
public
junior
college
in
a
community
where
there
already
was
a
good
private
college
which
served
the
middle-class
youth
adequately
but
was
too
expensive
for
working-class
youth
.
In
situations
of
this
sort
the
board
generally
favors
the
expansion
of
free
education
.
Campbell
studied
the
records
of
172
school
board
members
in
twelve
western
cities
over
the
period
of
1931
-
40
and
found
``
little
or
no
relationship
between
certain
social
and
economic
factors
and
school
board
competence
''
,
as
judged
by
a
panel
of
professional
educators
who
studied
the
voting
records
on
educational
issues
.
The
few
cases
of
clear
favoritism
along
social-class
lines
are
as
likely
as
not
to
involve
representatives
of
the
working
class
on
the
school
board
who
favor
some
such
practice
as
higher
wages
for
janitors
rather
than
pay
increases
for
teachers
,
and
such
issues
are
not
issues
of
educational
policy
.
In
general
,
it
appears
that
trustees
and
board
members
attempt
to
represent
the
public
interest
in
their
administration
of
educational
policy
,
and
this
is
made
easier
by
the
fact
that
the
dominant
values
of
the
society
are
middle-class
values
,
which
are
generally
thought
to
be
valid
for
the
entire
society
.
There
have
been
very
few
cases
of
explicit
conflict
of
interest
between
the
middle
class
and
any
other
class
in
the
field
of
educational
policy
.
If
there
were
more
such
cases
,
it
would
be
easier
to
answer
the
question
whether
the
policy-makers
favor
their
own
social
classes
.
There
is
currently
a
major
controversy
of
public
education
in
which
group
interests
and
values
are
heavily
engaged
.
This
is
the
issue
of
segregated
schools
in
the
South
.
In
this
case
it
is
primarily
a
matter
of
conflict
of
racial
groups
rather
than
social-class
groups
.
Thus
,
the
white
middle
and
lower
classes
are
arrayed
against
the
Negro
middle
and
lower
classes
.
This
conflict
may
be
resolved
in
a
way
which
will
suit
white
middle-class
people
better
than
it
suits
white
lower-class
people
.
If
this
happens
,
there
may
be
some
class
conflict
in
the
South
,
with
school
boards
and
school
teachers
taking
the
middle-class
position
.
The
educational
profession
The
members
of
the
educational
profession
have
a
major
voice
in
the
determination
of
educational
policy
,
their
position
being
strongest
in
the
universities
.
They
are
mostly
upper-middle-
and
lower-middle-class
people
,
with
a
few
in
the
upper
class
.
Do
they
make
class-biased
decisions
?
?
In
a
society
dominated
by
middle-class
values
and
working
in
an
institution
which
transmits
and
strengthens
these
social
values
,
it
is
clear
that
the
educational
profession
must
work
for
the
values
which
are
characteristic
of
the
society
.
There
is
no
problem
here
.
The
problem
arises
,
if
it
does
arise
,
when
the
educator
has
to
make
a
choice
or
a
decision
within
the
area
of
his
professional
competence
,
but
which
bears
some
relation
to
the
social
structure
.
For
instance
,
in
giving
school
grades
or
in
making
recommendations
for
the
award
of
a
college
scholarship
,
does
he
consciously
or
unconsciously
favor
students
of
one
or
another
social
class
?
?
Again
,
in
deciding
on
the
content
and
method
of
his
teaching
,
does
he
favor
a
curriculum
which
will
make
his
students
stronger
competitors
in
the
race
for
higher
economic
status
,
or
does
he
favor
a
curriculum
which
strengthens
students
in
other
ways
?
?
The
answers
to
questions
such
as
these
certainly
depend
to
some
extent
upon
the
educator's
own
social-class
position
and
also
upon
his
social
history
,
as
well
as
upon
his
personality
and
what
he
conceives
his
mission
to
be
as
an
educator
.
In
a
set
of
case
studies
of
teachers
with
various
social-class
backgrounds
,
Wattenberg
illustrates
a
variety
of
approaches
to
students
and
to
teaching
which
depend
upon
the
teacher's
personality
as
well
as
on
his
social-class
background
.
One
upward-mobile
teacher
may
be
a
hard
taskmaster
for
lower-class
pupils
because
she
wants
them
to
develop
the
attitudes
and
skills
that
will
enable
them
to
climb
,
while
another
upward-mobile
teacher
may
be
a
very
permissive
person
with
lower-class
pupils
because
he
knows
their
disadvantages
and
deprivations
at
home
,
and
he
hopes
to
encourage
them
by
friendly
treatment
.
One
social-class
factor
which
plays
a
large
part
in
educational
policy
today
is
the
fact
that
a
great
many
school
and
college
teachers
are
upward
mobile
from
urban
lower-class
and
lower-middle-class
families
.
Their
own
experience
in
the
social
system
influences
their
work
and
attitudes
as
teachers
.
While
this
influence
is
a
complex
matter
,
depending
upon
personality
factors
in
the
individual
as
well
as
upon
his
social-class
experience
,
there
probably
are
some
general
statements
about
social-class
background
and
educational
policy
that
can
be
made
with
a
fair
degree
of
truth
.
Teachers
who
have
been
upward
mobile
probably
see
education
as
most
valuable
for
their
students
if
it
serves
students
as
it
has
served
them
;
;
that
is
,
they
are
likely
to
favor
a
kind
of
education
that
has
vocational-advancement
value
.
This
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
such
teachers
will
favor
vocational
education
,
as
contrasted
with
liberal
education
,
but
they
are
likely
to
favor
an
approach
to
liberal
education
which
has
a
maximal
vocational-advancement
value
,
as
against
a
kind
of
``
pure
''
liberal
education
that
is
not
designed
to
help
people
get
better
jobs
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
higher
education
since
World
War
2
,
has
moved
away
from
``
pure
''
liberal
education
toward
greater
emphasis
on
technology
and
specialization
.
There
are
several
causes
for
this
,
one
being
rapid
economic
development
with
increasing
numbers
of
of
middle-class
positions
requiring
engineering
or
scientific
training
.
But
another
cause
may
lie
in
the
experience
of
so
many
new
postwar
faculty
members
with
their
own
use
of
education
as
a
means
of
social
advancement
.
Compared
with
the
college
and
university
faculty
members
of
the
period
from
1900
to
1930
,
the
new
postwar
faculty
members
consist
of
more
children
of
immigrants
and
more
children
of
urban
working-class
fathers
.
Their
experience
is
quite
in
contrast
with
that
of
children
of
upper-
and
upper-middle-class
native-born
parents
,
who
are
more
likely
to
regard
education
as
good
for
its
own
sake
and
to
discount
the
vocational
emphases
in
the
curriculum
.
The
``
public
interest
''
groups
Educational
policies
are
formed
by
several
groups
who
are
officially
or
unofficially
appointed
to
act
in
the
public
interest
.
Legislators
are
one
such
group
,
and
state
legislators
have
major
responsibility
for
educational
legislation
.
They
generally
vote
so
as
to
serve
their
own
constituency
,
and
if
the
constituency
should
be
solidly
middle
class
or
solidly
lower
class
,
they
might
be
expected
to
vote
and
work
for
middle-
or
for
lower-class
interests
in
education
.
However
,
there
are
relatively
few
such
political
constituencies
,
and
,
as
has
been
pointed
out
,
there
is
seldom
a
clear-cut
distinction
between
the
educational
interests
of
one
social
class
and
those
of
another
.
Another
public
interest
group
is
the
commission
of
laymen
or
educators
which
is
appointed
to
study
an
educational
problem
and
to
make
recommendations
.
Generally
these
commissions
work
earnestly
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
entire
society
,
as
they
conceive
it
.
Nevertheless
,
their
conclusions
and
recommendations
cannot
please
everybody
,
and
they
often
represent
a
particular
economic
or
political
point
of
view
.
For
instance
,
there
have
been
two
Presidential
Commissions
on
higher
education
since
World
War
2
.
President
Truman's
Commission
on
Higher
Education
tended
to
take
a
liberal
,
expansionist
position
,
while
President
Eisenhower's
Committee
on
Education
Beyond
the
High
School
was
slightly
more
conservative
.
Both
Commissions
consisted
of
upper-middle-
and
upper-class
people
,
who
attempted
to
act
in
the
public
interest
.
An
example
of
a
more
definite
class
bias
is
noted
in
proceedings
of
the
Commission
on
the
Financing
of
Higher
Education
sponsored
by
the
Association
of
American
Universities
and
supported
by
the
Rockefeller
Foundation
and
the
Carnegie
Corporation
.
This
Commission
recommended
against
the
use
of
federal
government
funds
for
the
assistance
of
private
universities
and
against
a
broad
program
of
government-supported
scholarships
.
This
might
be
said
to
be
an
upper-
or
an
upper-middle-class
bias
,
but
the
Commission
published
as
one
of
its
staff
studies
a
book
by
Byron
S.
Hollingshead
entitled
Who
Should
Go
To
College
?
?
Which
recommended
a
federal
government
scholarship
program
.
Furthermore
,
the
Commission
set
up
the
Council
for
Financial
Aid
to
Education
as
a
means
of
encouraging
private
business
to
increase
its
support
of
private
higher
education
.
Thus
,
the
Commission
acted
with
a
sense
of
social
responsibility
within
the
area
of
its
own
convictions
about
the
problem
of
government
support
to
private
education
.
Then
there
are
the
trustees
and
officers
of
the
great
educational
foundations
,
who
inevitably
exert
an
influence
on
educational
decisions
by
their
support
or
refusal
to
support
various
educational
programs
,
experiments
,
and
demonstrations
.
These
people
are
practically
always
upper-
or
upper-middle-class
persons
,
who
attempt
to
act
in
what
they
regard
as
the
interest
of
the
entire
society
.
Finally
there
are
the
parent
organizations
and
the
laymen's
organizations
such
as
the
National
Association
of
Parents
and
Teachers
,
and
the
Citizens
Committee
on
Public
Schools
.
These
have
an
upper-middle-class
leadership
and
a
middle-class
membership
,
with
rare
exceptions
,
where
working-class
parents
are
active
in
local
P.-T.A.
matters
.
Like
the
other
policy-making
groups
,
these
are
middle
class
in
their
educational
attitudes
,
and
they
attempt
to
act
in
the
general
public
interest
,
as
they
see
it
.
In
general
,
it
appears
that
educational
decisions
and
educational
policies
are
made
by
people
who
intend
to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
society
as
a
whole
.
They
are
predominantly
middle-
and
upper-class
people
,
and
undoubtedly
share
the
values
and
attitudes
of
those
classes
.
They
may
be
unaware
of
the
existence
of
lower-class
values
and
consequently
fail
to
take
them
into
account
.
But
there
is
very
little
frank
and
conscious
espousal
of
the
interests
of
any
one
social
class
by
the
people
who
have
the
power
to
make
decisions
in
education
.
They
think
of
themselves
as
trustees
for
the
entire
society
and
try
to
serve
the
entire
society
.
Attempts
to
influence
social
structure
through
education
Educational
policy
in
the
United
States
has
as
an
explicit
goal
the
maximization
of
economic
and
cultural
opportunity
.
In
so
far
as
this
goal
is
achieved
,
the
society
becomes
more
fluid
,
artificial
barriers
to
social
mobility
are
reduced
,
and
people
at
the
lower
end
of
the
social
hierarchy
share
more
fully
in
the
material
and
cultural
goods
of
society
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
a
counterbalancing
purpose
in
education
which
is
to
pass
on
the
advantages
of
the
parents
to
their
children
.
This
leads
to
efforts
at
exclusiveness
through
private
schools
and
to
the
maintenance
of
social
stratification
in
the
schools
.
Both
of
these
purposes
exist
side
by
side
without
much
overt
conflict
under
present
conditions
.
Maximizing
economic
and
cultural
opportunity
The
broad
expansion
of
free
education
results
both
in
raising
the
average
economic
and
cultural
level
of
the
society
and
in
promoting
fluidity
within
the
social
structure
.
Fifty
years
ago
the
general
raising
of
the
school-leaving
age
to
sixteen
was
an
example
of
this
movement
.
During
the
past
decade
the
program
has
been
carried
on
through
expansion
of
free
higher
education
in
state
universities
,
state
colleges
,
and
community
colleges
.
The
reaffirmation
of
American
faith
in
the
comprehensive
high
school
,
as
expressed
in
the
Conant
study
,
is
another
indication
of
the
liveliness
of
the
ideal
of
maximizing
opportunity
through
the
equalizing
of
educational
opportunity
.
The
recent
federal
government's
student-loan
program
is
another
step
in
the
direction
of
making
higher
education
more
available
to
lower-status
youth
.
It
is
probably
more
effective
than
the
expanded
scholarship
programs
of
the
past
decade
,
because
the
scholarship
programs
mainly
aided
the
students
with
the
best
academic
records
(
who
were
usually
middle-class
)
,
and
these
students
tended
to
use
the
scholarship
funds
to
go
to
more
expensive
colleges
.
Meanwhile
,
the
private
colleges
have
increased
their
tuition
rates
so
much
that
they
have
raised
an
economic
barrier
which
dwarfs
their
scholarship
funds
.
The
gains
in
educational
opportunity
during
the
past
decade
have
taken
place
largely
in
the
publicly
supported
institutions
.
Unfortunately
,
however
,
and
for
reasons
to
be
discussed
in
the
following
chapter
,
no
rate
relationships
can
be
made
completely
nondiscriminatory
as
long
as
all
or
some
of
the
rates
must
be
set
above
marginal
costs
in
order
to
yield
adequate
revenues
.
And
this
fact
may
explain
some
of
the
disagreements
among
the
experts
as
to
the
more
rational
formulas
for
the
apportionment
of
total
costs
among
different
units
of
service
.
One
such
disagreement
,
which
will
receive
attention
in
this
next
chapter
,
concerns
the
question
whether
rates
for
different
kinds
of
service
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
attribute
of
discrimination
,
must
be
made
directly
proportional
to
marginal
costs
,
or
whether
they
should
be
based
instead
on
differences
in
marginal
costs
.
Here
,
the
choice
is
that
between
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
.
Two
major
types
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis
1
.
The
double-step
type
Despite
an
ambiguity
due
to
its
failure
clearly
to
define
``
relative
costs
''
,
the
above
exposition
of
fully
distributed
costing
goes
about
as
far
as
one
can
go
toward
expressing
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
practice
.
For
more
explicit
expositions
,
one
must
distinguish
different
types
of
analyses
.
By
all
means
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
between
those
total-cost
apportionments
which
superimpose
a
distribution
of
admittedly
unallocable
cost
residues
on
estimates
of
incremental
or
marginal
costs
,
and
those
other
apportionments
which
recognize
no
difference
between
true
cost
allocation
and
mere
total-cost
distribution
.
The
first
,
or
double-step
,
type
might
also
be
called
the
``
railroad
type
''
because
of
its
application
to
railroads
(
and
other
transportation
agencies
)
by
the
Cost
Section
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
.
The
Cost
Section
distinguishes
between
(
directly
)
variable
costs
and
constant
costs
in
a
manner
noted
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
The
variable
costs
alone
are
assigned
to
the
different
units
of
freight
traffic
as
representing
``
long-run
out-of-pocket
costs
''
--
a
term
with
a
meaning
here
not
distinctly
different
from
that
of
the
economist's
``
long-run
marginal
costs
''
.
There
remains
a
residue
of
total
costs
,
or
total
``
revenue
requirements
''
which
,
since
it
is
found
to
behave
as
if
it
were
constant
over
substantial
variations
in
traffic
density
,
is
strictly
unallocable
on
a
cost-finding
basis
.
Nevertheless
,
because
the
Cost
Section
has
felt
impelled
to
make
some
kind
of
a
distribution
of
total
costs
,
it
has
apportioned
this
residue
,
which
it
sometimes
calls
``
burden
''
,
among
the
units
of
carload
traffic
on
a
basis
(
partly
ton
,
partly
ton-mile
)
which
is
concededly
quite
arbitrary
from
the
standpoint
of
cost
determination
.
In
recent
years
,
this
burden
(
which
includes
allowances
for
revenue
deficiencies
in
the
passenger
business
and
in
less-than-carload
freight
traffic
!
!
)
has
amounted
to
about
one
third
of
those
total
revenue
requirements
which
the
carload
freight
business
is
supposed
to
be
called
upon
to
meet
.
Since
this
book
is
concerned
only
incidentally
with
railroad
rates
,
it
will
not
attempt
to
analyze
the
methods
by
which
the
staff
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
has
estimated
out-of-pocket
costs
and
apportioned
residue
costs
.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
usefulness
of
the
latter
apportionment
is
questionable
.
But
in
any
event
,
full
credit
should
be
given
to
the
Cost
Section
for
its
express
and
overt
recognition
of
a
vital
distinction
too
often
ignored
in
utility-cost
analyses
:
namely
,
that
between
a
cost
allocation
designed
to
reflect
the
actual
behavior
of
costs
in
response
to
changes
in
rates
of
output
of
different
classes
of
utility
service
;
;
and
a
mere
cost
apportionment
which
somehow
spreads
among
the
classes
and
units
of
service
even
those
costs
that
are
strictly
unallocable
from
the
standpoint
of
specific
cost
determination
.
2
.
The
single-step
type
We
turn
now
to
a
type
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis
which
,
unlike
the
``
railroad
type
''
,
draws
no
distinction
between
cost
allocation
and
cost
apportionment
:
the
single-step
type
.
It
might
be
called
the
``
public
utility
''
type
because
of
the
considerable
use
to
which
it
has
been
put
in
gas
and
electric
utility
rate
cases
.
Here
no
attempt
is
made
,
first
to
determine
out-of-pocket
or
marginal
costs
and
then
to
superimpose
on
these
costs
``
reasonably
distributed
''
residues
of
total
costs
.
Instead
,
all
of
the
total
costs
are
treated
as
variable
costs
,
although
these
costs
are
divided
into
costs
that
are
deemed
to
be
functions
of
different
variables
.
Moreover
,
whereas
in
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
parlance
``
variable
cost
''
means
a
cost
deemed
to
vary
in
direct
proportion
to
changes
in
rate
of
output
,
in
the
type
of
analysis
now
under
review
``
variable
cost
''
has
been
used
more
broadly
,
so
as
to
cover
costs
which
,
while
a
function
of
some
one
variable
(
such
as
output
of
energy
,
or
number
of
customers
)
,
are
not
necessarily
a
linear
function
.
As
already
noted
in
an
earlier
paragraph
,
the
more
familiar
cost
analyses
of
utility
enterprises
or
utility
systems
divide
the
total
costs
among
a
number
of
major
classes
of
service
,
such
as
residential
,
commercial
,
industrial
power
,
street
lighting
,
etc.
.
This
``
grand
division
''
permits
many
costs
to
be
assigned
in
their
entirety
to
some
one
class
,
such
as
street
lighting
,
or
at
least
to
be
excluded
completely
from
some
important
class
or
classes
.
High-tension
industrial
power
service
,
for
example
,
would
not
be
charged
with
any
share
of
the
maintenance
costs
or
capital
costs
of
the
low-tension
distribution
lines
.
But
the
major
portions
of
the
total
costs
of
a
utility
business
are
common
or
joint
to
all
,
or
nearly
all
,
classes
of
customers
;
;
and
these
costs
must
somehow
be
apportioned
among
the
various
classes
and
then
must
somehow
be
reapportioned
among
the
units
of
service
in
order
to
report
unit
costs
that
can
serve
as
tentative
measures
of
reasonable
rates
.
The
general
basis
on
which
these
common
costs
are
assigned
to
differently
measured
units
of
service
will
be
illustrated
by
the
following
highly
simplified
problem
of
an
electric-utility
cost
analysis
.
But
before
turning
to
this
example
,
we
must
distinguish
two
subtypes
of
analysis
,
both
of
which
belong
to
the
single-step
type
rather
than
to
the
double-step
type
.
In
the
first
subtype
,
the
analyst
(
following
the
practice
of
railroad
analysis
in
this
particular
respect
)
distributes
both
total
operating
costs
and
total
annual
capital
costs
(
including
an
allowance
for
``
cost
of
capital
''
or
``
fair
rate
of
return
''
)
among
the
different
classes
and
units
of
service
.
Here
,
an
apportionment
,
say
,
of
$5,000,000
of
the
total
costs
to
residential
service
as
a
class
would
include
an
allowance
of
perhaps
6
per
cent
as
the
cost
of
whatever
capital
is
deemed
to
have
been
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
residential
consumers
.
But
in
the
second
subtype
,
which
I
take
to
be
the
one
more
frequently
applied
,
only
the
operating
expenses
and
not
the
``
cost
of
capital
''
or
``
fair
return
''
are
apportioned
directly
among
the
various
classes
of
service
.
To
be
sure
,
the
capital
investments
in
(
or
,
alternatively
,
the
estimated
``
fair
values
''
of
)
the
plant
and
equipment
are
apportioned
among
the
different
classes
,
as
are
also
the
gross
revenues
received
from
the
sales
of
the
different
services
.
But
any
resulting
excess
of
revenues
received
from
a
given
class
of
service
over
the
operating
costs
imputed
to
this
class
is
reported
as
a
``
return
''
realized
on
the
capital
investment
attributed
to
the
same
service
.
Thus
,
during
any
given
year
(
A
)
if
the
revenues
from
the
residential
service
are
$7,000,000
,
(
B
)
if
the
operating
expenses
imputed
to
this
class
of
service
come
to
$5,000,000
,
and
(
C
)
if
the
net
investment
in
(
or
value
of
)
the
plant
and
equipment
deemed
devoted
to
this
service
amounts
to
$30,000,000
,
the
cost
analyst
will
report
that
residential
service
,
in
the
aggregate
,
has
yielded
a
return
of
$2,000,000
or
6-2/3
per
cent
.
Other
services
will
show
different
rates
of
return
,
some
probably
much
lower
and
some
higher
.
There
are
obvious
reasons
of
convenience
for
this
practice
of
excluding
``
cost
of
capital
''
from
the
direct
apportionment
of
annual
costs
among
the
different
classes
of
service
--
notably
,
the
avoidance
of
the
controversial
question
what
rate
of
return
should
be
held
to
constitute
``
cost
of
capital
''
or
``
fair
rate
of
return
''
.
But
the
practice
is
likely
to
be
misleading
,
since
it
may
seem
to
support
a
conclusion
that
,
as
long
as
the
revenues
from
any
class
of
service
cover
the
imputed
operating
expenses
plus
some
return
on
capital
investment
,
however
low
,
the
rates
of
charge
for
this
service
are
compensatory
.
Needless
to
say
,
any
such
inference
would
be
quite
unwarranted
.
For
the
reason
just
suggested
,
I
shall
assume
the
use
of
the
first
subtype
of
fully
distributed
cost
apportionment
in
the
following
simplified
example
.
That
is
to
say
,
an
allowance
for
``
cost
of
capital
''
will
be
assumed
to
be
included
directly
in
the
cost
apportionment
.
Three-part
analysis
of
the
costs
of
an
electric
utility
business
In
order
to
simplify
the
exposition
of
a
typical
fully
apportioned
cost
analysis
,
let
us
assume
the
application
of
the
analysis
to
an
electric
utility
company
supplying
a
single
city
with
power
generated
by
its
own
steam-generation
plant
.
Let
us
also
assume
the
existence
of
only
one
class
or
type
of
service
,
all
of
which
is
supplied
at
the
same
voltage
,
phase
,
etc.
to
residential
,
commercial
,
and
industrial
customers
.
This
latter
assumption
will
permit
us
to
center
attention
on
the
most
controversial
aspect
of
modern
public
utility
cost
analysis
--
the
distinction
among
costs
that
are
functions
of
outputs
of
the
same
service
measured
along
different
dimensions
.
Since
the
company
under
review
is
supplying
what
we
are
here
regarding
as
only
one
kind
of
service
,
we
might
suppose
that
the
problem
of
total
cost
apportionment
would
be
very
simple
;
;
indeed
,
that
it
would
be
limited
to
a
finding
of
the
total
annual
operating
and
capital
costs
of
the
business
,
followed
by
a
calculation
of
this
total
in
terms
of
annual
cost
per
kilowatt-hour
of
consumption
.
In
fact
,
however
,
the
problem
is
not
so
simple
.
For
a
statement
of
costs
per
kilowatt-hour
would
ignore
the
fact
that
many
of
these
costs
are
not
a
function
of
kilowatt-hour
output
(
or
consumption
)
of
energy
.
A
recognition
of
multiple
cost
functions
is
therefore
required
.
The
simplest
division
,
and
the
one
most
frequently
used
(
with
subdivisions
)
in
gas
and
electric
rate
cases
,
is
a
threefold
division
of
the
total
operating
and
capital
costs
into
``
customer
costs
''
,
``
energy
''
or
``
volumetric
costs
''
,
and
``
demand
''
or
``
capacity
''
costs
.
If
this
threefold
division
of
costs
were
to
have
its
counterpart
in
the
actual
rates
of
charge
for
service
,
as
it
actually
does
have
in
some
rates
,
there
would
result
a
three-part
rate
for
any
one
class
of
service
.
For
example
,
the
monthly
bill
of
a
residential
consumer
might
be
the
sum
of
a
$1
customer
charge
,
a
$5
charge
for
250
kilowatt-hours
of
energy
at
per
kilowatt-hour
,
and
a
$2
charge
for
a
maximum
demand
of
2
kilowatts
during
the
month
at
the
rate
of
$1
per
kilowatt
--
a
total
bill
of
$8
for
that
month
.
But
our
present
interest
lies
in
the
measurement
of
costs
of
service
,
and
only
indirectly
in
rates
that
may
or
may
not
be
designed
to
cover
these
costs
.
Let
us
therefore
consider
each
of
the
three
types
of
cost
in
turn
,
recognizing
that
this
simplified
classification
is
used
only
for
illustrative
purposes
;
;
costs
actually
vary
in
much
more
complex
ways
.
1
.
The
customer
costs
These
are
those
operating
and
capital
costs
found
to
vary
with
number
of
customers
regardless
,
or
almost
regardless
,
of
power
consumption
.
Included
as
a
minimum
are
the
costs
of
metering
and
billing
along
with
whatever
other
expenses
the
company
must
incur
in
taking
on
another
consumer
.
These
minimum
costs
may
come
to
$1
per
month
,
more
or
less
,
for
residential
and
small
commercial
customers
,
although
they
are
substantially
higher
for
large
industrial
users
,
who
require
more
costly
connections
and
metering
devices
.
While
costs
on
this
order
are
sometimes
separately
charged
for
in
residential
and
commercial
rates
,
in
the
form
of
a
mere
``
service
charge
''
,
they
are
more
frequently
wholly
or
partly
covered
by
a
minimum
charge
which
entitles
the
consumer
to
a
very
small
amount
of
gas
or
electricity
with
no
further
payment
.
But
the
really
controversial
aspect
of
customer-cost
imputation
arises
because
of
the
cost
analyst's
frequent
practice
of
including
,
not
just
those
costs
that
can
be
definitely
earmarked
as
incurred
for
the
benefit
of
specific
customers
but
also
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
annual
maintenance
and
capital
costs
of
the
secondary
(
low-voltage
)
distribution
system
--
a
fraction
equal
to
the
estimated
annual
costs
of
a
hypothetical
system
of
minimum
capacity
.
The
preconditions
of
sociology
have
remained
largely
unexamined
by
the
sociologist
.
Like
primitive
numbers
in
mathematics
,
the
entire
axiological
framework
is
taken
to
rest
upon
its
operational
worth
.
But
what
is
the
operational
worth
of
a
sociology
which
mimetically
reproduces
the
idea
of
physical
models
?
?
Is
it
not
the
task
of
philosophy
to
see
what
intelligible
meaning
can
be
assigned
to
the
most
sacred
canons
in
social
science
?
?
It
has
become
painfully
clear
that
the
very
attempt
to
make
the
language
of
social
research
free
of
values
by
erecting
mathematical
and
physical
models
,
is
itself
a
conditioned
response
to
a
world
which
pays
a
premium
price
for
technological
manipulation
.
This
push
to
confine
the
study
of
mass
behaviour
to
the
measurements
of
parameters
involved
in
differential
equations
has
led
sociology
perilously
close
to
the
reduction
of
the
word
``
mass
''
to
mean
a
small
group
in
which
certain
relations
between
all
pairs
of
individuals
in
such
a
group
can
be
studied
.
(
cf.
Rapoport
,
1959
:
:
Ch.
11
.
)
Here
I
think
the
role
of
the
philosopher
becomes
apparent
.
The
simple
pragmatic
success
of
the
sociology
of
small
groups
needs
to
be
questioned
.
For
if
the
small
group
notion
involves
the
implicit
claim
that
the
phenomena
of
sociological
investigations
are
of
atomic
or
subatomic
proportions
,
the
philosopher
needs
to
know
the
extent
to
which
such
entities
are
valid
.
The
mere
exploration
of
the
unconscious
ground
of
present-day
sociology
offers
a
rich
vein
of
philosophical
and
logical
investigation
.
(
cf.
Brodbeck
,
1959
:
:
Ch.
12
.
)
A
parallel
function
for
philosophy
is
the
study
of
the
relation
between
perceptions
experientially
received
and
conceptions
logically
formed
.
Philosophy
can
supply
adequate
criteria
of
meaning
in
the
selection
of
socially
viable
categories
.
This
involves
a
sifting
of
the
empirical
and
rational
elements
entering
into
each
social
science
statement
.
Merton's
functional
sociology
may
have
great
practical
use
in
the
study
of
different
cultures
,
yet
it
is
perfectly
clear
,
as
Nagel
(
1957
:
:
247
-
83
)
and
Hempel
(
1959
:
:
271
-
307
)
indicate
,
that
the
concept
of
function
in
sociology
has
been
built
up
from
physiological
and
biological
models
,
in
which
the
notions
of
teleology
,
i.e.
,
metaphysical
purpose
,
are
central
.
(
cf.
Chapter
9
.
)
Functionalism
as
a
sociological
credo
is
,
therefore
,
not
a
direct
consequence
of
observations
,
but
rather
an
indirect
consequence
of
philosophical
inference
and
judgment
.
The
purpose
of
this
sort
of
philosophical
study
of
sociology
is
not
to
tyrannize
but
to
clarify
the
principles
of
social
science
.
It
is
absurd
to
speak
of
philosophy
as
a
superior
enterprise
to
sociology
,
since
the
former
is
a
logical
,
rational
discipline
,
where
sociology
is
essentially
descriptive
and
empirical
.
Such
a
position
entails
the
negation
of
philosophy
in
its
Platonic
form
as
something
soaring
above
and
embracing
the
empirical
and
mathematical
sciences
.
But
contrary
to
Whitehead
,
philosophy
is
not
a
synonym
for
Plato
.
The
uses
of
philosophy
as
a
logical
clearing
house
are
manifest
to
any
approach
that
does
not
descend
to
pure
sensationalism
.
However
,
when
philosophy
attempts
to
stand
above
the
sciences
,
to
dictate
the
conditions
of
empirical
research
,
it
becomes
formal
metaphysics
;
;
shaping
the
contours
of
life
to
fit
the
needs
of
legends
.
The
notion
of
philosophy
as
Queen
Bee
may
fit
well
with
authoritarian
modes
of
political
ideology
,
but
it
has
been
noted
that
the
price
of
such
an
imperial
notion
of
philosophy
is
the
frustration
and
flagellation
of
the
social
sciences
.
(
cf.
Wetter
,
1952
:
:
Pt.
2
,
Ch.
5
;
;
Horowitz
1957b
.
)
Metaphysics
is
no
longer
a
direct
grappling
with
nature
as
it
was
in
antiquity
.
It
has
surrendered
any
claims
of
description
in
favor
of
psychological
accounts
of
nothingness
,
as
in
Heidegger's
system
(
1929
)
.
Science
is
mocked
for
wishing
to
know
nothing
of
Nothing
,
in
a
last
ditch
effort
to
save
the
gods
at
the
expense
of
men
.
It
is
not
positivism
which
has
isolated
metaphysics
from
reality
by
distinguishing
between
description
and
prescription
.
It
is
simply
revealing
the
state
to
which
metaphysical
thinking
has
fallen
during
this
century
.
Consider
the
traditional
``
four
fields
''
of
philosophy
:
logic
,
ethics
,
epistemology
and
esthetics
.
It
is
a
commonplace
that
to
the
degree
these
special
preserves
of
past
philosophic
hunting
grounds
establish
an
empirical
content
and
suitable
methodological
criteria
,
they
move
away
from
philosophy
as
such
.
What
is
left
to
traditional
systems
of
philosophy
is
,
in
effect
,
only
the
history
of
these
fields
prior
to
their
becoming
rigorous
enough
to
abide
by
the
canons
of
scientific
method
.
In
this
situation
,
philosophy
has
survived
by
separating
itself
from
metaphysics
,
by
showing
the
ultimate
questions
to
be
the
meaningless
questions
.
The
relinquishing
by
philosophy
of
pretentious
claims
to
empirical
priority
gives
it
an
ability
to
treat
problems
of
meaning
and
truth
which
in
the
past
it
was
unable
to
examine
because
of
its
missionary
attitude
to
knowledge
of
more
humble
sorts
.
In
the
new
situation
,
philosophy
is
able
to
provide
the
social
sciences
with
the
same
guidance
that
mathematics
offers
the
physical
sciences
,
a
reservoir
of
logical
relations
that
can
be
used
in
framing
hypotheses
having
explanatory
and
predictive
value
.
Beyond
this
,
philosophy
may
urge
the
social
sciences
forward
by
asking
the
type
of
question
that
falls
outside
the
present
scope
of
social
inquiry
,
but
within
its
potential
domain
of
relevance
.
In
this
connection
,
it
might
be
noted
that
the
theory
of
games
was
a
mathematical
discovery
long
before
its
uses
in
political
science
were
exploited
.
Likewise
,
Kant
formulated
the
nebular
hypothesis
,
according
to
which
the
solar
system
was
evolved
from
a
rotating
mass
of
incandescent
gas
,
nearly
a
half
century
before
its
scientific
value
was
made
plain
by
Laplace
in
his
Systeme
Du
Monde
.
This
does
not
mean
that
philosophy
resolves
the
problems
it
generates
,
any
more
so
than
Riemann's
geometry
settled
the
physical
status
of
the
space-time
continuum
.
But
the
forceful
presentation
of
new
issues
for
the
sciences
to
work
on
is
itself
a
monumental
task
.
To
those
raised
on
Marcel's
Homo
Viator
and
Heidegger's
das
Nichtige
,
this
may
seem
a
modest
role
for
philosophy
.
However
,
modesty
and
triviality
are
different
qualities
.
Philosophy
conceived
of
as
servant
to
the
sciences
might
appear
as
less
dramatic
than
philosophy
which
jeers
as
the
sciences
evolve
.
The
ceaseless
effort
to
understand
and
measure
the
distance
mankind
has
traversed
since
its
primitive
anthropological
status
offers
a
more
durable
sort
of
drama
.
By
clarifying
fundamental
premises
in
the
social
sciences
,
and
defining
the
logical
problems
emergent
at
the
borderlands
of
each
new
scientific
discipline
,
philosophy
can
offer
the
sort
of
distinction
that
can
accelerate
growth
in
human
understanding
.
Philosophy
can
prevent
the
working
scientist
from
becoming
slothful
and
self-content
by
noting
the
assumptions
and
level
at
which
a
hypothesis
or
theory
is
framed
.
The
dissection
of
scientific
theory
,
the
examination
of
a
theory
from
the
vantage-points
of
language
,
epistemology
,
and
ethics
,
is
itself
a
distinct
contribution
to
knowledge
,
no
less
so
because
of
its
removal
from
empirical
research
.
The
realm
of
science
,
whatever
the
degree
of
precision
in
formulations
,
covers
the
range
of
prediction
and
explanation
.
(
cf.
Hempel
and
Oppenheim
,
1948
:
:
135
-
75
.
)
Whatever
philosophy
is
conceived
to
be
,
its
rationalist
,
logistic
attitude
to
evidence
should
make
it
clear
that
it
is
something
other
than
science
.
For
some
forms
of
philosophy
,
this
very
division
between
the
empirical
and
the
rational
becomes
a
sign
of
the
metaphysical
superiority
of
the
latter
.
Bergson
and
Leroy
announce
that
``
the
secret
is
the
center
of
a
philosophy
''
and
thereafter
a
hundred
followers
declare
secrecy
a
higher
verity
.
This
is
simply
a
confession
of
intellectual
sterility
spruced
up
to
look
virtuous
.
For
as
Merleau-Ponty
indicated
(
1953
)
,
it
is
not
the
secret
which
is
important
,
but
the
removal
of
secrecy
.
In
this
,
philosophy
and
science
share
a
common
goal
.
The
hypostatization
of
the
secret
nonetheless
guarantees
that
the
division
of
analytical
and
synthetic
philosophies
shall
not
be
overcome
by
even
the
most
persuasive
argument
;
;
for
this
division
is
but
an
abstract
representation
of
the
social
struggle
between
mysticism
and
science
.
The
mystification
of
metaphysical
systems
does
not
imply
the
demise
of
philosophy
,
only
the
close
of
a
philosophic
age
which
demanded
metaphysics
to
be
rational
and
logical
.
The
tenacity
with
which
present
metaphysical
attitudes
fetishize
private
intuition
offers
the
strongest
evidence
that
the
gulf
between
scientific
and
delphic
ways
of
philosophizing
is
built
into
the
present
conflict
over
the
limits
and
purpose
of
science
,
religion
and
ideology
.
(
cf.
McGlynn
:
1958
.
)
Scientific
systems
,
and
this
includes
even
the
relation
of
mechanist
to
relativist
physics
,
are
built
upon
,
refined
and
corrected
.
Philosophic
systems
,
by
the
very
nature
of
their
completeness
,
are
overthrown
by
rival
systems
.
In
addition
to
the
incompleteness
of
science
and
the
completeness
of
metaphysics
,
they
differ
in
that
science
is
essentially
descriptive
,
while
philosophy
in
its
inherited
forms
,
tends
to
be
goal-oriented
,
teleological
and
prescriptive
.
The
threadbare
notion
that
belief
,
unlike
behaviour
,
is
not
subject
to
objective
analysis
,
has
placed
intuitive
metaphysics
squarely
against
the
sociology
of
knowledge
,
since
it
is
precisely
the
job
of
the
sociology
of
knowledge
to
treat
beliefs
as
social
facts
no
less
viable
than
social
behaviour
.
When
dealing
with
the
actual
relation
of
philosophy
to
the
sociology
of
knowledge
,
or
better
the
role
of
philosophy
in
assisting
research
on
the
social
sources
of
ideas
,
one
has
to
become
necessarily
selective
.
Certain
features
we
have
touched
upon
:
philosophy
as
a
logical
,
deductive
system
from
which
a
social
science
methodology
can
be
built
up
;
;
philosophic
analysis
of
the
assumptions
and
presumptions
of
the
social
sciences
;
;
and
philosophy
as
a
guide
to
possible
integration
of
supposedly
disparate
sociological
investigations
.
The
objection
will
be
raised
that
the
most
important
role
of
philosophy
in
relation
to
social
science
has
been
omitted
,
namely
the
status
of
ultimate
value
questions
and
norms
operative
in
the
social
sciences
.
Specifically
,
it
will
be
asked
whether
the
``
real
''
questions
people
ask
are
not
the
``
ultimate
''
questions
that
social
science
finds
itself
impotent
in
the
face
of
.
What
then
is
the
status
of
such
questions
as
:
is
society
the
ground
of
human
existence
or
a
means
to
an
individual
goal
?
?
Do
societies
develop
according
to
cosmic
patterns
or
are
they
subject
only
to
the
free
choice
of
individuals
?
?
Does
society
really
exist
as
an
entity
over
and
above
the
agglomeration
of
men
?
?
I
think
it
must
be
said
that
,
contrary
to
metaphysical
insistence
,
these
are
questions
so
framed
as
to
defy
either
empirical
exploration
or
rational
solutions
.
As
Simmel
(
1908
)
and
Dilthey
(
1922
)
indicated
,
questions
of
whether
the
value
of
life
is
individual
or
social
are
not
questions
,
but
assertions
of
faith
made
to
appear
as
legitimate
questions
.
Such
pseudo-questions
assume
that
answers
of
concrete
significance
can
be
supplied
to
statements
involving
undefined
universals
.
Social
theory
has
no
more
right
to
expect
results
from
meaningless
questions
,
than
physics
has
the
right
to
expect
a
theological
solution
to
the
wave-particle
controversy
.
It
is
not
that
such
questions
are
not
asked
.
It
is
rather
that
introducing
them
into
social
analysis
reflects
not
so
much
a
search
for
truth
as
for
certainty
.
An
operational
approach
to
sociology
can
never
expect
abstract
certainty
,
since
it
is
certainty
which
every
new
discovery
in
science
either
replaces
or
reshapes
.
To
raise
the
added
objection
that
men
require
certainty
on
psychological
grounds
,
answers
to
ultimate
questions
having
an
irrational
rather
than
scientific
basis
,
is
in
a
real
sense
to
undermine
the
objection
itself
.
For
what
concerns
all
scientific
disciplines
is
precisely
that
which
can
be
captured
for
the
rational
,
i.e.
,
for
the
scientific
determination
of
what
in
past
ages
was
considered
ultimate
and
irrational
.
A
philosophy
which
attempts
to
supply
ultimate
answers
in
an
ultimate
way
reveals
its
acquiescence
in
the
shortcomings
of
men
,
an
impatience
with
partial
,
tentative
solutions
.
Men
have
always
lived
in
a
tentative
world
,
and
in
suspension
of
ultimate
judgments
where
and
when
necessary
.
Uncertainty
overcoming
itself
is
the
precondition
of
the
quest
for
new
and
more
precise
information
about
the
world
.
Without
such
uncertainty
we
are
left
with
a
set
of
dogmas
and
myths
.
The
functional
interplay
of
philosophy
and
science
should
,
as
a
minimum
,
guarantee
a
meaningful
option
to
myth-making
.
A
degree
of
indefiniteness
is
a
salutary
condition
for
the
growth
of
science
.
But
neither
was
the
statement
empirical
,
for
goodness
was
not
a
quality
like
red
or
squeaky
that
could
be
seen
or
heard
.
What
were
they
to
do
,
then
,
with
these
awkward
judgments
of
value
?
?
To
find
a
place
for
them
in
their
theory
of
knowledge
would
require
them
to
revise
the
theory
radically
,
and
yet
that
theory
was
what
they
regarded
as
their
most
important
discovery
.
It
appeared
that
the
theory
could
be
saved
in
one
way
only
.
If
it
could
be
shown
that
judgments
of
good
and
bad
were
not
judgments
at
all
,
that
they
asserted
nothing
true
or
false
,
but
merely
expressed
emotions
like
``
Hurrah
''
or
``
Fiddlesticks
''
,
then
these
wayward
judgments
would
cease
from
troubling
and
weary
heads
could
be
at
rest
.
This
is
the
course
the
positivists
took
.
They
explained
value
judgments
by
explaining
them
away
.
Now
I
do
not
think
their
view
will
do
.
But
before
discussing
it
,
I
should
like
to
record
one
vote
of
thanks
to
them
for
the
clarity
with
which
they
have
stated
their
case
.
It
has
been
said
of
John
Stuart
Mill
that
he
wrote
so
clearly
that
he
could
be
found
out
.
This
theory
has
been
put
so
clearly
and
precisely
that
it
deserves
criticism
of
the
same
kind
,
and
this
I
will
do
my
best
to
supply
.
The
theory
claims
to
show
by
analysis
that
when
we
say
,
``
That
is
good
''
,
we
do
not
mean
to
assert
a
character
of
the
subject
of
which
we
are
thinking
.
I
shall
argue
that
we
do
mean
to
do
just
that
.
Let
us
work
through
an
example
,
and
the
simpler
and
commoner
the
better
.
There
is
perhaps
no
value
statement
on
which
people
would
more
universally
agree
than
the
statement
that
intense
pain
is
bad
.
Let
us
take
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
I
happen
to
be
interested
on
the
legislative
side
and
in
which
I
think
every
one
of
us
might
naturally
make
such
a
statement
.
We
come
upon
a
rabbit
that
has
been
caught
in
one
of
the
brutal
traps
in
common
use
.
There
are
signs
that
it
has
struggled
for
days
to
escape
and
that
in
a
frenzy
of
hunger
,
pain
,
and
fear
,
it
has
all
but
eaten
off
its
own
leg
.
The
attempt
failed
:
the
animal
is
now
dead
.
As
we
think
of
the
long
and
excruciating
pain
it
must
have
suffered
,
we
are
very
likely
to
say
:
``
It
was
a
bad
thing
that
the
little
animal
should
suffer
so
''
.
The
positivist
tells
us
that
when
we
say
this
we
are
only
expressing
our
present
emotion
.
I
hold
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
we
mean
to
assert
something
of
the
pain
itself
,
namely
,
that
it
was
bad
--
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
.
Consider
what
follows
from
the
positivist
view
.
On
that
view
,
nothing
good
or
bad
happened
in
the
case
until
I
came
on
the
scene
and
made
my
remark
.
For
what
I
express
in
my
remark
is
something
going
on
in
me
at
the
time
,
and
that
of
course
did
not
exist
until
I
did
come
on
the
scene
.
The
pain
of
the
rabbit
was
not
itself
bad
;
;
nothing
evil
was
happening
when
that
pain
was
being
endured
;
;
badness
,
in
the
only
sense
in
which
it
is
involved
at
all
,
waited
for
its
appearance
till
I
came
and
looked
and
felt
.
Now
that
this
is
at
odds
with
our
meaning
may
be
shown
as
follows
.
Let
us
put
to
ourselves
the
hypothesis
that
we
had
not
come
on
the
scene
and
that
the
rabbit
never
was
discovered
.
Are
we
prepared
to
say
that
in
that
case
nothing
bad
occurred
in
the
sense
in
which
we
said
it
did
?
?
Clearly
not
.
Indeed
,
we
should
say
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
accident
of
our
later
discovery
made
no
difference
whatever
to
the
badness
of
the
animal's
pain
,
that
it
would
have
been
every
whit
as
bad
whether
a
chance
passer-by
happened
later
to
discover
the
body
and
feel
repugnance
or
not
.
If
so
,
then
it
is
clear
that
in
saying
the
suffering
was
bad
we
are
not
expressing
our
feelings
only
.
We
are
saying
that
the
pain
was
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
and
before
anyone
took
an
attitude
toward
it
.
The
first
argument
is
thus
an
ideal
experiment
in
which
we
use
the
method
of
difference
.
It
removes
our
present
expression
and
shows
that
the
badness
we
meant
would
not
be
affected
by
this
,
whereas
on
positivist
grounds
it
should
be
.
The
second
argument
applies
the
method
in
the
reverse
way
.
It
ideally
removes
the
past
event
,
and
shows
that
this
would
render
false
what
we
mean
to
say
,
whereas
on
positivist
grounds
it
should
not
.
Let
us
suppose
that
the
animal
did
not
in
fact
fall
into
the
trap
and
did
not
suffer
at
all
,
but
that
we
mistakenly
believe
it
did
,
and
say
as
before
that
its
suffering
was
an
evil
thing
.
On
the
positivist
theory
,
everything
I
sought
to
express
by
calling
it
evil
in
the
first
case
is
still
present
in
the
second
.
In
the
only
sense
in
which
badness
is
involved
at
all
,
whatever
was
bad
in
the
first
case
is
still
present
in
its
entirety
,
since
all
that
is
expressed
in
either
case
is
a
state
of
feeling
,
and
that
feeling
is
still
there
.
And
our
question
is
,
is
such
an
implication
consistent
with
what
we
meant
?
?
Clearly
it
is
not
.
If
anyone
asked
us
,
after
we
made
the
remark
that
the
suffering
was
a
bad
thing
,
whether
we
should
think
it
relevant
to
what
we
said
to
learn
that
the
incident
had
never
occurred
and
no
pain
had
been
suffered
at
all
,
we
should
say
that
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
,
that
what
we
were
asserting
to
be
bad
was
precisely
the
suffering
we
thought
had
occurred
back
there
,
that
if
this
had
not
occurred
,
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
bad
,
and
that
our
assertion
was
in
that
case
mistaken
.
The
suggestion
that
in
saying
something
evil
had
occurred
we
were
after
all
making
no
mistake
,
because
we
had
never
meant
anyhow
to
say
anything
about
the
past
suffering
,
seems
to
me
merely
frivolous
.
If
we
did
not
mean
to
say
this
,
why
should
we
be
so
relieved
on
finding
that
the
suffering
had
not
occurred
?
?
On
the
theory
before
us
,
such
relief
would
be
groundless
,
for
in
that
suffering
itself
there
was
nothing
bad
at
all
,
and
hence
in
its
nonoccurrence
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
relieved
about
.
The
positivist
theory
would
here
distort
our
meaning
beyond
recognition
.
So
far
as
I
can
see
,
there
is
only
one
way
out
for
the
positivist
.
He
holds
that
goodness
and
badness
lie
in
feelings
of
approval
or
disapproval
.
And
there
is
a
way
in
which
he
might
hold
that
badness
did
in
this
case
precede
our
own
feeling
of
disapproval
without
belonging
to
the
pain
itself
.
The
pain
in
itself
was
neutral
;
;
but
unfortunately
the
rabbit
,
on
no
grounds
at
all
,
took
up
toward
this
neutral
object
an
attitude
of
disapproval
and
that
made
it
for
the
first
time
,
and
in
the
only
intelligible
sense
,
bad
.
This
way
of
escape
is
theoretically
possible
,
but
since
it
has
grave
difficulties
of
its
own
and
has
not
,
so
far
as
I
know
,
been
urged
by
positivists
,
it
is
perhaps
best
not
to
spend
time
over
it
.
I
come
now
to
a
third
argument
,
which
again
is
very
simple
.
When
we
come
upon
the
rabbit
and
make
our
remark
about
its
suffering
being
a
bad
thing
,
we
presumably
make
it
with
some
feeling
;
;
the
positivists
are
plainly
right
in
saying
that
such
remarks
do
usually
express
feeling
.
But
suppose
that
a
week
later
we
revert
to
the
incident
in
thought
and
make
our
statement
again
.
And
suppose
that
the
circumstances
have
now
so
changed
that
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
the
remark
in
the
first
place
has
faded
.
The
pathetic
evidence
is
no
longer
before
us
;
;
and
we
are
now
so
fatigued
in
body
and
mind
that
feeling
is
,
as
we
say
,
quite
dead
.
In
these
circumstances
,
since
what
was
expressed
by
the
remark
when
first
made
is
,
on
the
theory
before
us
,
simply
absent
,
the
remark
now
expresses
nothing
.
It
is
as
empty
as
the
word
``
Hurrah
''
would
be
when
there
was
no
enthusiasm
behind
it
.
And
this
seems
to
me
untrue
.
When
we
repeat
the
remark
that
such
suffering
was
a
bad
thing
,
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
it
last
week
may
be
at
or
near
the
vanishing
point
,
but
if
we
were
asked
whether
we
meant
to
say
what
we
did
before
,
we
should
certainly
answer
Yes
.
We
should
say
that
we
made
our
point
with
feeling
the
first
time
and
little
or
no
feeling
the
second
time
,
but
that
it
was
the
same
point
we
were
making
.
And
if
we
can
see
that
what
we
meant
to
say
remains
the
same
,
while
the
feeling
varies
from
intensity
to
near
zero
,
it
is
not
the
feeling
that
we
primarily
meant
to
express
.
I
come
now
to
a
fourth
consideration
.
We
all
believe
that
toward
acts
or
effects
of
a
certain
kind
one
attitude
is
fitting
and
another
not
;
;
but
on
the
theory
before
us
such
a
belief
would
not
make
sense
.
Broad
and
Ross
have
lately
contended
that
this
fitness
is
one
of
the
main
facts
of
ethics
,
and
I
suspect
they
are
right
.
But
that
is
not
exactly
my
point
.
My
point
is
this
:
whether
there
is
such
fitness
or
not
,
we
all
assume
that
there
is
,
and
if
we
do
,
we
express
in
moral
judgments
more
than
the
subjectivists
say
we
do
.
Let
me
illustrate
.
In
his
novel
The
House
Of
The
Dead
,
Dostoevsky
tells
of
his
experiences
in
a
Siberian
prison
camp
.
Whatever
the
unhappy
inmates
of
such
camps
are
like
today
,
Dostoevsky's
companions
were
about
as
grim
a
lot
as
can
be
imagined
.
``
I
have
heard
stories
''
,
he
writes
,
``
of
the
most
terrible
,
the
most
unnatural
actions
,
of
the
most
monstrous
murders
,
told
with
the
most
spontaneous
,
childishly
merry
laughter
''
.
Most
of
us
would
say
that
in
this
delight
at
the
killing
of
others
or
the
causing
of
suffering
there
is
something
very
unfitting
.
If
we
were
asked
why
we
thought
so
,
we
should
say
that
these
things
involve
great
evil
and
are
wrong
,
and
that
to
take
delight
in
what
is
evil
or
wrong
is
plainly
unfitting
.
Now
on
the
subjectivist
view
,
this
answer
is
ruled
out
.
For
before
someone
takes
up
an
attitude
toward
death
,
suffering
,
or
their
infliction
,
they
have
no
moral
quality
at
all
.
There
is
therefore
nothing
about
them
to
which
an
attitude
of
approval
or
condemnation
could
be
fitting
.
They
are
in
themselves
neutral
,
and
,
so
far
as
they
get
a
moral
quality
,
they
get
it
only
through
being
invested
with
it
by
the
attitude
of
the
onlooker
.
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
is
any
attitude
more
fitting
than
any
other
?
?
Would
applause
,
for
example
,
be
fitting
if
,
apart
from
the
applause
,
there
were
nothing
good
to
applaud
?
?
Would
condemnation
be
fitting
if
,
independently
of
the
condemnation
,
there
were
nothing
bad
to
condemn
?
?
In
such
a
case
,
any
attitude
would
be
as
fitting
or
unfitting
as
any
other
,
which
means
that
the
notion
of
fitness
has
lost
all
point
.
Indeed
,
we
are
forced
to
go
much
farther
.
If
goodness
and
badness
lie
in
attitudes
only
and
hence
are
brought
into
being
by
them
,
those
men
who
greeted
death
and
misery
with
childishly
merry
laughter
are
taking
the
only
sensible
line
.
If
there
is
nothing
evil
in
these
things
,
if
they
get
their
moral
complexion
only
from
our
feeling
about
them
,
why
shouldn't
they
be
greeted
with
a
cheer
?
?
To
greet
them
with
repulsion
would
turn
what
before
was
neutral
into
something
bad
;
;
it
would
needlessly
bring
badness
into
the
world
;
;
and
even
on
subjectivist
assumptions
that
does
not
seem
very
bright
.
On
the
other
hand
,
to
greet
them
with
delight
would
convert
what
before
was
neutral
into
something
good
;
;
it
would
bring
goodness
into
the
world
.
The
injured
German
veteran
was
a
former
miner
,
twenty-four
years
old
,
who
had
been
wounded
by
shrapnel
in
the
back
of
the
head
.
This
resulted
in
damage
to
the
occipital
lobe
and
very
probably
to
the
left
side
of
the
cerebellum
also
.
In
any
event
,
the
extraordinary
result
of
this
injury
was
that
he
became
``
psychically
blind
''
,
while
at
the
same
time
,
apparently
,
the
sense
of
touch
remained
essentially
intact
.
Psychical
blindness
is
a
condition
in
which
there
is
a
total
absence
of
visual
memory-images
,
a
condition
in
which
,
for
example
,
one
is
unable
to
remember
something
just
seen
or
to
conjure
up
a
memory-picture
of
the
visible
appearance
of
a
well-known
friend
in
his
absence
.
This
circumstance
in
the
patient's
case
plus
the
fact
that
his
tactual
capacity
remained
basically
in
sound
working
order
constitutes
its
exceptional
value
for
the
problem
at
hand
since
the
evidence
presented
by
the
authors
is
overwhelming
that
,
when
the
patient
closed
his
eyes
,
he
had
absolutely
no
spatial
(
that
is
,
third-dimensional
)
awareness
whatsoever
.
The
necessary
inference
,
as
the
authors
themselves
interpret
it
,
would
seem
to
be
this
:
``
(
(
1
)
Spatial
qualities
are
not
among
those
grasped
by
the
sense
of
touch
,
as
such
.
We
do
not
arrive
at
spatial
images
by
means
of
the
sense
of
touch
by
itself
.
(
2
)
Spatiality
becomes
part
of
the
tactual
sensation
only
by
way
of
visual
representations
;
;
that
is
,
there
is
,
in
the
true
sense
,
only
a
visual
space
''
.
The
underlying
assumption
,
of
course
,
is
that
only
sight
and
touch
enable
us
,
in
any
precise
and
fully
dependable
way
,
to
locate
objects
in
space
beyond
us
,
the
other
senses
being
decidedly
inferior
,
if
not
totally
inadequate
,
in
this
regard
.
This
is
an
assumption
with
which
few
would
be
disposed
to
quarrel
.
Therefore
,
if
the
sense
of
touch
is
functioning
normally
and
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
spatial
awareness
in
a
psychically-blind
person
when
the
eyes
are
closed
and
an
object
is
handled
,
the
conclusion
seems
unavoidable
that
touch
by
itself
cannot
focus
and
take
possession
of
the
third-dimensionality
of
things
and
that
actual
sight
or
visual
representations
are
necessary
.
The
force
of
the
authors'
analysis
(
if
indeed
it
has
any
force
)
can
be
felt
by
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
only
after
three
questions
have
been
successfully
answered
.
(
1
)
What
allows
us
to
think
that
the
patient
had
no
third-dimensional
representations
when
his
eyes
were
closed
?
?
(
2
)
What
evidence
is
there
that
he
was
psychically
blind
?
?
(
3
)
How
can
we
be
sure
that
his
sense
of
touch
was
not
profoundly
disturbed
by
his
head
injury
?
?
We
shall
consider
these
in
the
inverse
order
of
their
presentation
.
Obviously
,
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
third
question
is
imperative
,
if
the
argument
is
to
get
under
way
at
all
,
for
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
doubt
whether
the
patient's
tactual
sensitivity
had
been
impaired
by
the
occipital
lesion
,
any
findings
whatsoever
in
regard
to
the
first
question
become
completely
ambiguous
and
fail
altogether
,
of
course
,
as
evidence
to
establish
the
desired
conclusion
.
The
answer
the
authors
give
to
it
,
therefore
,
is
of
supreme
importance
.
It
is
as
follows
:
``
The
usual
sensitivity
tests
showed
that
the
specific
qualities
of
skin-perceptiveness
(
pressure
,
pain
,
temperature
)
,
as
well
as
the
kinesthetic
sensations
(
muscular
feelings
,
feelings
in
the
tendons
and
joints
)
,
were
,
as
such
,
essentially
intact
,
although
they
seemed
,
in
comparison
with
normal
reactions
,
to
be
somewhat
diminished
over
the
entire
body
.
The
supposed
tactual
sense
of
spatial
location
and
orientation
in
the
patient
and
his
ability
to
specify
the
location
of
a
member
,
as
well
as
the
direction
and
scope
of
a
movement
,
passively
executed
(
with
one
of
his
members
)
,
proved
to
have
been
,
on
the
contrary
,
very
considerably
affected
''
.
The
authors
insist
,
however
,
that
these
abnormalities
in
the
sense
of
touch
were
due
absolutely
to
no
organic
disorders
in
that
sense
faculty
but
rather
to
the
injuries
which
the
patient
had
sustained
to
the
sense
of
sight
.
First
of
all
,
what
is
their
evidence
that
the
tactual
apparatus
was
fundamentally
undamaged
?
?
(
1
)
When
an
object
was
placed
in
the
patient's
hand
,
he
had
no
difficulty
determining
whether
it
was
warm
or
cold
,
sharp
or
blunt
,
rough
or
smooth
,
flexible
,
soft
,
or
hard
;
;
and
he
could
tell
,
simply
by
the
feel
of
it
,
whether
it
was
made
of
wood
,
iron
,
cloth
,
rubber
,
and
so
on
.
And
he
could
recognize
,
by
touch
alone
,
articles
which
he
had
handled
immediately
before
,
even
though
they
were
altogether
unfamiliar
to
him
and
could
not
be
identified
by
him
;
;
that
is
,
he
was
unaware
what
kind
of
objects
they
were
or
what
their
use
was
.
(

The
patient
attained
an
astonishing
efficiency
in
a
new
trade
.
Because
of
his
brain
injury
and
the
extreme
damage
suffered
to
his
sight
,
the
patient
had
to
train
himself
for
a
new
line
of
work
,
that
of
a
portfolio-maker
,
an
occupation
requiring
a
great
deal
of
precision
in
the
making
of
measurements
and
a
fairly
well-developed
sense
of
form
and
contour
.
It
seems
clear
,
when
one
takes
into
consideration
the
exceedingly
defective
eyesight
of
the
patient
(
we
shall
describe
it
in
detail
in
connection
with
our
second
question
,
the
one
concerning
the
psychical
blindness
of
the
patient
)
,
that
he
had
to
rely
on
his
sense
of
touch
much
more
than
the
usual
portfolio-maker
and
that
consequently
that
faculty
was
most
probably
more
sensitive
to
shape
and
size
than
that
of
a
person
with
normal
vision
.
And
so
the
authors
conclude
:
``
The
conduct
of
the
patient
in
his
every-day
life
and
in
his
work
,
even
more
than
the
foregoing
facts
(
mentioned
above
under
1
)
,
leave
positively
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
sense
of
touch
,
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
,
was
unaffected
;
;
or
,
to
put
the
same
thing
in
physiological
terms
,
that
the
performance-capacity
of
the
tactual
apparatus
,
from
the
periphery
up
to
the
tactual
centers
in
the
brain
,
--
that
is
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
--
was
unimpaired
''
.
If
the
argument
is
accepted
as
essentially
sound
up
to
this
point
,
it
remains
for
us
to
consider
whether
the
patient's
difficulties
in
orienting
himself
spatially
and
in
locating
objects
in
space
with
the
sense
of
touch
can
be
explained
by
his
defective
visual
condition
.
But
before
we
can
do
this
,
we
must
first
find
answers
to
our
original
questions
1
and
2
;
;
then
we
shall
perhaps
be
in
a
position
to
provide
something
like
a
complete
answer
to
the
question
at
hand
.
In
what
ways
,
then
,
did
the
patient's
psychical
blindness
manifest
itself
?
?
He
could
not
see
objects
as
unified
,
self-contained
,
and
organized
figures
,
as
a
person
does
with
normal
vision
.
The
meaning
of
this
,
as
we
shall
see
,
is
that
he
had
no
fund
of
visual
memory-images
of
objects
as
objects
;
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
could
not
recognize
even
long-familiar
things
upon
seeing
them
again
.
Instead
,
he
constantly
became
lost
in
parts
and
components
of
them
,
confused
some
of
their
details
with
those
of
neighboring
objects
,
and
so
on
,
unless
he
allowed
time
to
``
trace
''
the
object
in
question
through
minute
movements
of
the
head
and
hands
and
in
this
way
to
discover
its
contours
.
According
to
his
own
testimony
,
he
never
actually
saw
things
as
shaped
but
only
as
generally
amorphous
``
blots
''
of
color
of
a
more
or
less
indefinite
size
;
;
at
their
edges
they
slipped
pretty
much
out
of
focus
altogether
.
But
by
the
tracing
procedure
,
he
could
,
in
a
strange
obviously
kinesthetic
manner
,
find
the
unseen
form
;
;
could
piece
,
as
it
were
,
the
jumbled
mass
together
into
an
organized
whole
and
then
recognize
it
as
a
man
or
a
triangle
or
whatever
it
turned
out
to
be
.
If
,
however
,
the
figure
to
be
discerned
were
complicated
,
composed
of
several
interlocking
subfigures
,
and
so
on
,
even
the
tracing
process
failed
him
,
and
he
could
not
focus
even
relatively
simple
shapes
among
its
parts
.
This
meant
,
concretely
,
that
the
patient
could
not
read
at
all
without
making
writing-like
movements
of
the
head
or
body
,
became
easily
confused
by
``
hasher
marks
''
inserted
between
hand-written
words
and
thus
confused
the
mark
for
one
of
the
letters
,
and
could
recognize
a
simple
straight
line
or
a
curved
one
only
by
tracing
it
.
The
patient
himself
denied
that
he
had
any
visual
imagery
at
all
;
;
and
there
was
ample
evidence
of
the
following
sort
to
corroborate
him
.
After
a
conversation
with
another
man
,
he
was
able
to
recount
practically
everything
that
had
been
said
but
could
not
describe
at
all
what
the
other
man
looked
like
.
Nor
could
he
call
up
memory-pictures
of
close
friends
or
relatives
.
In
short
,
both
his
own
declarations
and
his
figural
blindness
,
when
he
looked
at
objects
,
seem
to
present
undeniable
evidence
that
he
had
simply
no
visual
memory
at
all
.
He
was
oblivious
of
the
form
of
the
object
actually
being
viewed
,
precisely
because
he
could
not
assign
it
to
a
visual
shape
,
already
learned
and
held
in
visual
memory
,
as
persons
of
normal
vision
do
.
He
could
not
recognize
it
;
;
he
was
absolutely
unfamiliar
with
it
because
he
had
no
visual
memory
at
all
.
Therefore
,
his
only
recourse
was
to
learn
the
shape
all
over
again
for
each
new
visual
experience
of
the
same
individual
object
or
type
of
object
;
;
and
this
he
could
do
only
by
going
over
its
mass
with
the
tracing
procedure
.
Then
he
might
finally
recognize
it
,
apparently
by
combining
the
visual
blot
,
actually
being
seen
,
with
tactual
feelings
in
the
head
or
body
accompanying
the
tracing
movements
.
This
would
mean
,
it
can
readily
be
seen
,
that
,
again
,
for
each
new
visual
experience
,
the
tracing
motions
would
have
to
be
repeated
because
of
the
absence
of
visual
imagery
.
As
one
would
surmise
,
the
procedure
,
however
,
could
be
repeated
with
the
same
object
or
with
the
same
type
of
object
often
enough
,
so
that
the
corresponding
visual
blots
and
the
merest
beginning
of
the
tracing
movement
would
provide
clues
as
to
the
actual
shape
,
which
the
patient
then
immediately
could
determine
by
a
kind
of
inference
.
Men
,
trees
,
automobiles
,
houses
,
and
so
on
--
objects
continually
confronted
in
everyday
life
--
had
each
its
characteristic
blot-appearance
and
became
easily
recognizable
,
at
the
very
beginning
of
tracing
,
by
an
inference
as
to
what
each
was
.
Dice
,
for
example
,
he
inferred
from
black
dots
on
a
white
surface
.
He
evidently
could
not
actually
see
the
corners
of
these
objects
,
but
their
size
and
the
dots
gave
them
away
.
And
the
authors
give
numerous
instances
of
calculated
guessing
on
the
patient's
part
to
show
how
large
a
role
it
played
in
his
process
of
readapting
himself
and
how
proficient
he
became
at
it
.
Often
he
seems
even
to
have
been
able
to
guess
correctly
,
without
the
tracing
motions
,
solely
on
the
basis
of
qualitative
differences
among
the
blot-like
things
which
appeared
in
his
visual
experience
.
Perhaps
the
very
important
question
--
What
is
,
then
,
exactly
the
role
of
kinesthetic
sensations
in
the
patient's
ability
to
recognize
forms
and
shapes
by
means
of
the
tracing
movements
when
he
is
actually
looking
at
things
?
?
--
has
now
been
raised
in
the
reader's
mind
and
in
the
following
form
.
If
the
patient
can
perceive
figure
kinesthetically
when
he
cannot
perceive
it
visually
,
then
,
it
would
seem
,
the
sense
of
touch
has
immediate
contact
with
the
spatial
aspects
of
things
in
independence
of
visual
representations
,
at
least
in
regard
to
two
dimensions
,
and
,
as
we
shall
see
,
even
this
much
spatial
awareness
on
the
part
of
unaided
touch
is
denied
by
the
authors
.
How
,
then
,
do
the
kinesthetic
sensations
function
in
all
this
?
?
The
authors
set
about
answering
this
fundamental
question
through
a
detailed
investigation
of
the
patient's
ability
,
tactually
,
(
1
)
to
perceive
figure
and
(
2
)
to
locate
objects
in
space
,
with
his
eyes
closed
(
or
turned
away
from
the
object
concerned
)
.
Quite
naturally
,
they
make
the
investigation
,
first
,
by
prohibiting
the
patient
from
making
any
movements
at
all
and
then
,
later
,
by
repeating
it
and
allowing
the
patient
to
move
in
any
way
he
wanted
to
.
When
the
patient
was
not
allowed
to
move
his
body
in
any
way
at
all
,
the
following
striking
results
occurred
.
Whenever
artists
,
indeed
,
turned
to
actual
representations
or
molded
three-dimensional
figures
,
which
were
rare
down
to
800
B.C.
,
they
tended
to
reflect
reality
(
see
Plate
6a
,
9b
)
;
;
a
schematic
,
abstract
treatment
of
men
and
animals
,
by
intent
,
rose
only
in
the
late
eighth
century
.
To
speak
of
this
underlying
view
of
the
world
is
to
embark
upon
matters
of
subjective
judgment
.
At
the
least
,
however
,
one
may
conclude
that
Geometric
potters
sensed
a
logical
order
;
;
their
principles
of
composition
stand
very
close
to
those
which
appear
in
the
Homeric
epics
and
the
hexameter
line
.
Their
world
,
again
,
was
a
still
simple
,
traditional
age
which
was
only
slowly
beginning
to
appreciate
the
complexity
of
life
.
And
perhaps
an
observer
of
the
vases
will
not
go
too
far
in
deducing
that
the
outlook
of
their
makers
and
users
was
basically
stable
and
secure
.
The
storms
of
the
past
had
died
away
,
and
the
great
upheaval
which
was
to
mark
the
following
century
had
not
yet
begun
to
disturb
men's
minds
.
Throughout
the
work
of
the
later
ninth
century
a
calm
,
severe
serenity
displays
itself
.
In
the
vases
this
spirit
may
perhaps
at
times
bore
or
repel
one
in
its
internal
self-satisfaction
,
but
the
best
of
the
Geometric
pins
have
rightly
been
considered
among
the
most
beautiful
ever
made
in
the
Greek
world
.
The
ninth
century
was
in
its
artistic
work
``
the
spiritually
freest
and
most
self-sufficient
between
past
and
future
''
,
and
the
loving
skill
spent
by
its
artists
upon
their
products
is
a
testimonial
to
their
sense
that
what
they
were
doing
was
important
and
was
appreciated
.
The
Aegean
in
800
B.C.
Geometric
pottery
has
not
yet
received
the
thorough
,
detailed
study
which
it
deserves
,
partly
because
the
task
is
a
mammoth
one
and
partly
because
some
of
its
local
manifestations
,
as
at
Argos
,
are
only
now
coming
to
light
.
From
even
a
cursory
inspection
of
its
many
aspects
,
however
,
the
historian
can
deduce
several
fundamental
conclusions
about
the
progress
of
the
Aegean
world
down
to
800
B.C.
.
The
general
intellectual
outlook
which
had
appeared
in
the
eleventh
century
was
now
consolidated
to
a
significant
degree
.
Much
which
was
in
embryo
in
1000
had
become
reasonably
well
developed
by
800
.
In
this
process
the
Minoan-Mycenaean
inheritance
had
been
transmuted
or
finally
rejected
;
;
the
Aegean
world
which
had
existed
before
1000
differed
from
that
which
rises
more
clearly
in
our
vision
after
800
.
Those
modern
scholars
who
urge
that
we
must
keep
in
mind
the
fundamental
continuity
of
Aegean
development
from
earliest
times
--
granted
occasional
irruptions
of
peoples
and
ideas
from
outside
--
are
correct
;
;
but
all
too
many
observers
have
been
misled
by
this
fact
into
minimizing
the
degree
of
change
which
took
place
in
the
early
first
millennium
.
The
focus
of
novelty
in
this
world
now
lay
in
the
south-eastern
districts
of
the
Greek
mainland
,
and
by
800
virtually
the
entire
Aegean
,
always
excepting
its
northern
shores
,
had
accepted
the
Geometric
style
of
pottery
.
While
Protogeometric
vases
usually
turn
up
,
especially
outside
Greece
proper
,
together
with
as
many
or
more
examples
of
local
stamp
,
these
``
non-Greek
''
patterns
had
mostly
vanished
by
the
later
ninth
century
.
In
their
place
came
local
variations
within
the
common
style
--
tentative
,
as
it
were
,
in
Protogeometric
products
but
truly
distinct
and
sharply
defined
as
the
Geometric
spirit
developed
.
Attica
,
though
important
,
was
not
the
only
teacher
of
this
age
.
One
can
take
a
vase
of
about
800
B.C.
and
,
without
any
knowledge
of
its
place
of
origin
,
venture
to
assign
it
to
a
specific
area
;
;
imitation
and
borrowing
of
motifs
now
become
ascertainable
.
The
potters
of
the
Aegean
islands
thus
stood
apart
from
those
of
the
mainland
,
and
in
Greece
itself
Argive
,
Corinthian
,
Attic
,
Boeotian
,
and
other
Geometric
sequences
have
each
their
own
hallmarks
.
These
local
variations
were
to
become
ever
sharper
in
the
next
century
and
a
half
.
The
same
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
the
other
physical
evidence
of
the
Dark
ages
,
from
linguistic
distribution
,
and
from
the
survivals
of
early
social
,
political
,
and
religious
patterns
into
later
ages
.
By
800
B.C.
the
Aegean
was
an
area
of
common
tongue
and
of
common
culture
.
On
these
pillars
rested
that
solid
basis
for
life
and
thought
which
was
soon
to
be
manifested
in
the
remarkably
unlimited
ken
of
the
Iliad
.
Everywhere
within
the
common
pattern
,
however
,
one
finds
local
diversity
;
;
Greek
history
and
culture
were
enduringly
fertilized
,
and
plagued
,
by
the
interplay
of
these
conjoined
yet
opposed
factors
.
Further
we
cannot
go
,
for
the
Dark
ages
deserve
their
name
.
Many
aspects
of
civilization
were
not
yet
sufficiently
crystallized
to
find
expression
,
nor
could
the
simple
economic
and
social
foundations
of
this
world
support
a
lofty
structure
.
The
epic
poems
,
the
consolidation
of
the
Greek
pantheon
,
the
rise
of
firm
political
units
,
the
self-awareness
which
could
permit
painted
and
sculptured
representations
of
men
--
all
these
had
to
await
the
progress
of
following
decades
.
What
we
have
seen
in
this
chapter
,
we
have
seen
only
dimly
,
and
yet
the
results
,
however
general
,
are
worth
the
search
.
These
are
the
centuries
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
Aegean
world
settled
firmly
into
their
minds
and
into
their
institutions
the
foundations
of
the
Hellenic
outlook
,
independent
of
outside
forces
.
To
interpret
,
indeed
,
the
era
from
1000
to
800
as
a
period
mainly
of
consolidation
may
be
a
necessary
but
unfortunate
defect
born
of
our
lack
of
detailed
information
;
;
if
we
could
see
more
deeply
,
we
probably
would
find
many
side
issues
and
wrong
turnings
which
came
to
an
end
within
the
period
.
The
historian
can
only
point
out
those
lines
which
were
major
enough
to
find
reflection
in
our
limited
evidence
,
and
must
hope
that
future
excavations
will
enrich
our
understanding
.
Throughout
the
Dark
ages
,
it
is
clear
,
the
Greek
world
had
been
developing
slowly
but
consistently
.
The
pace
could
now
be
accelerated
,
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
Aegean
stood
on
firm
ground
.
Chapter
5
the
early
eighth
century
the
landscape
of
Greek
history
broadens
widely
,
and
rather
abruptly
,
in
the
eighth
century
B.C.
,
the
age
of
Homer's
``
rosy-fingered
Dawn
''
.
The
first
slanting
rays
of
the
new
day
cannot
yet
dispel
all
the
dark
shadows
which
lie
across
the
Aegean
world
;
;
but
our
evidence
grows
considerably
in
variety
and
shows
more
unmistakably
some
of
the
lines
of
change
.
For
this
period
,
as
for
earlier
centuries
,
pottery
remains
the
most
secure
source
;
;
the
ceramic
material
of
the
age
is
more
abundant
,
more
diversified
,
and
more
indicative
of
the
hopes
and
fears
of
its
makers
,
who
begin
to
show
scenes
of
human
life
and
death
.
Figurines
and
simple
chapels
presage
the
emergence
of
sculpture
and
architecture
in
Greece
;
;
objects
in
gold
,
ivory
,
and
bronze
grow
more
numerous
.
Since
writing
was
practiced
in
the
Aegean
before
the
end
of
the
century
,
we
may
hope
that
the
details
of
tradition
will
now
be
occasionally
useful
.
Though
it
is
not
easy
to
apply
the
evidence
of
the
Iliad
to
any
specific
era
,
this
marvelous
product
of
the
epic
tradition
had
certainly
taken
definitive
shape
by
750
.
The
Dipylon
Geometric
pottery
of
Athens
and
the
Iliad
are
amazing
manifestations
of
the
inherent
potentialities
of
Greek
civilization
;
;
but
both
were
among
the
last
products
of
a
phase
which
was
ending
.
Greek
civilization
was
swirling
toward
its
great
revolution
,
in
which
the
developed
qualities
of
the
Hellenic
outlook
were
suddenly
to
break
forth
.
The
revolution
was
well
under
way
before
700
B.C.
,
and
premonitory
signs
go
back
virtually
across
the
century
.
The
era
,
however
,
is
Janus-faced
.
While
many
tokens
point
forward
,
the
main
achievements
stand
as
a
culmination
of
the
simple
patterns
of
the
Dark
ages
.
The
dominant
pottery
of
the
century
was
Geometric
;
;
political
organization
revolved
about
the
basileis
;
;
trade
was
just
beginning
to
expand
;
;
the
gods
who
protected
the
Greek
countryside
were
only
now
putting
on
their
sharply
anthropomorphic
dress
.
The
modern
student
,
who
knows
what
was
to
come
next
,
is
likely
to
place
first
the
factors
of
change
which
are
visible
in
the
eighth
century
.
Not
all
men
of
the
period
would
have
accepted
this
emphasis
.
Many
potters
clung
to
the
past
the
more
determinedly
as
they
were
confronted
with
radically
new
ideas
;
;
the
poet
of
the
Iliad
deliberately
archaized
.
Although
it
is
not
possible
to
sunder
old
and
new
in
this
era
,
I
shall
consider
in
the
present
chapter
primarily
the
first
decades
of
the
eighth
century
and
shall
interpret
them
as
an
apogee
of
the
first
stage
of
Greek
civilization
.
On
this
principle
of
division
I
must
postpone
the
evolution
of
sculpture
,
architecture
,
society
,
and
politics
;
;
for
the
developments
in
these
areas
make
sense
only
if
they
are
connected
to
the
age
of
revolution
itself
.
The
growing
contacts
between
Aegean
and
Orient
are
also
a
phase
which
should
be
linked
primarily
to
the
remarkable
broadening
of
Hellenic
culture
after
750
.
We
shall
not
be
able
entirely
to
pass
over
these
connections
to
the
East
as
we
consider
Ripe
Geometric
pottery
,
the
epic
and
the
myth
,
and
the
religious
evolution
of
early
Greece
;
;
the
important
point
,
however
,
is
that
these
magnificent
achievements
,
unlike
those
of
later
decades
,
were
only
incidentally
influenced
by
Oriental
models
.
The
antecedents
of
Dipylon
vases
and
of
the
Iliad
lie
in
the
Aegean
past
.
Dipylon
pottery
the
pottery
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighth
century
is
commonly
called
Ripe
Geometric
.
The
severe
yet
harmonious
vases
of
the
previous
fifty
years
,
the
Strong
Geometric
style
of
the
late
ninth
century
,
display
as
firm
a
mastery
of
the
principles
underlying
Geometric
pottery
;
;
but
artists
now
were
ready
to
refine
and
elaborate
their
inheritance
.
The
vases
which
resulted
had
different
shapes
,
far
more
complex
decoration
,
and
a
larger
sense
of
style
.
Beyond
the
aesthetic
and
technical
aspects
of
this
expansion
we
must
consider
the
change
in
pottery
style
on
broader
lines
.
In
earlier
centuries
men
had
had
enough
to
do
in
rebuilding
a
fundamental
sense
of
order
after
chaos
.
They
had
had
to
work
on
very
simple
foundations
and
had
not
dared
to
give
rein
to
impulses
.
The
potters
,
in
particular
,
had
virtually
eschewed
freehand
drawing
,
elaborate
motifs
,
and
the
curving
lines
of
nature
,
while
yet
expressing
a
belief
that
there
was
order
in
the
universe
.
In
their
vases
were
embodied
the
basic
aesthetic
and
logical
characteristics
of
Greek
civilization
,
at
first
hesitantly
in
Protogeometric
work
,
and
then
more
confidently
in
the
initial
stages
of
the
Geometric
style
.
By
800
social
and
cultural
security
had
been
achieved
,
at
least
on
a
simple
plane
;
;
it
was
time
to
take
bigger
steps
,
to
venture
on
experiments
.
Ripe
Geometric
potters
continued
to
employ
the
old
syntax
of
ornaments
and
shapes
and
made
use
of
the
well-defined
though
limited
range
of
motifs
which
they
had
inherited
.
In
these
respects
the
vases
of
the
early
eighth
century
represent
a
culmination
of
earlier
lines
of
progress
.
To
the
ancestral
lore
,
however
,
new
materials
were
added
.
Painters
left
less
and
less
of
a
vase
in
a
plain
dark
color
;
;
instead
they
divided
the
surface
into
many
bands
or
covered
it
by
all-over
patterns
into
which
freehand
drawing
began
to
creep
.
Wavy
lines
,
feather-like
patterns
,
rosettes
of
indefinitely
floral
nature
,
birds
either
singly
or
in
stylized
rows
,
animals
in
solemn
frieze
bands
(
see
Plates
11
-
12
)
--
all
these
turned
up
in
the
more
developed
fabrics
as
preliminary
signs
that
the
potters
were
broadening
their
gaze
.
The
rows
of
animals
and
birds
,
in
particular
,
suggest
awareness
of
Oriental
animal
friezes
,
transmitted
perhaps
via
Syrian
silver
bowls
and
textiles
,
but
the
specific
forms
of
these
rows
on
local
vases
and
metal
products
are
nonetheless
Greek
.
Though
the
spread
of
this
type
of
decoration
in
the
Aegean
has
not
yet
been
precisely
determined
,
it
seems
to
appear
first
in
the
Cyclades
,
which
were
among
the
leading
exporters
of
pottery
throughout
the
century
.
As
the
material
at
the
command
of
the
potters
grew
and
the
volume
of
their
production
increased
,
the
local
variations
within
a
common
style
became
more
evident
.
Plate
12
illustrates
four
examples
,
which
are
Ripe
or
Late
Geometric
work
of
common
spirit
but
of
different
schools
.
Cook
had
discovered
a
beef
in
his
possession
a
few
days
earlier
and
,
when
he
could
not
show
the
hide
,
arrested
him
.
Thinking
the
evidence
insufficient
to
get
a
conviction
,
he
later
released
him
.
Even
while
suffering
the
trip
to
his
home
,
Cook
swore
to
Moore
and
Lane
that
he
would
kill
the
Indian
.
Three
weeks
later
,
following
his
recovery
,
armed
with
a
writ
issued
by
the
Catskill
justice
on
affidavits
prepared
by
the
district
attorney
,
Cook
and
Russell
rode
to
arrest
Martinez
.
Arriving
at
daybreak
,
they
found
Julio
in
his
corral
and
demanded
that
he
surrender
.
Instead
,
he
whirled
and
ran
to
his
house
for
a
gun
,
forcing
them
to
kill
him
,
Cook
reported
.
Both
Cook's
and
Russell's
lives
were
threatened
by
the
Mexicans
following
the
killing
,
but
the
company
officers
felt
that
in
the
end
,
it
would
serve
to
quiet
them
despite
their
immediate
emotion
.
General
manager
Pels
even
suggested
that
it
might
be
wise
to
keep
the
Mexicans
in
suspense
rather
than
accept
their
offers
to
sell
out
and
move
away
,
and
try
to
have
a
few
punished
.
On
February
17
,
Russell
and
Cook
were
sent
to
the
Pena
Flor
community
on
the
Vermejo
to
see
about
renting
out
ranches
the
company
had
purchased
.
While
talking
with
Julian
M.
Beall
,
Francisco
Archuleta
and
Juan
Marcus
appeared
,
both
heavily
armed
,
and
after
watching
the
house
for
a
while
,
rode
away
.
It
was
nearly
sundown
before
they
finished
the
business
with
Beall
and
began
riding
down
the
stream
.
They
had
traveled
only
a
short
distance
when
they
spotted
five
Mexicans
riding
along
a
horse-trail
across
the
stream
just
ahead
of
them
.
Suspecting
an
ambush
,
the
two
deputies
decided
to
ride
up
a
side
canyon
taking
a
short
cut
into
Catskill
.
After
spending
two
nights
(
Wednesday
and
Thursday
)
in
Catskill
,
the
deputies
again
headed
for
the
Vermejo
to
finish
their
business
.
They
stayed
with
a
rancher
Friday
night
and
by
eleven
o'clock
Saturday
morning
passed
the
old
Garnett
Lee
ranch
.
Half
a
mile
below
at
the
mouth
of
Salyer's
Canyon
was
an
old
ranch
that
the
company
had
purchased
from
A.
J.
Armstrong
,
occupied
by
a
Mexican
,
his
wife
,
and
an
old
trapper
.
There
were
three
houses
in
Salyer's
Canyon
just
at
the
foot
of
a
low
bluff
,
the
road
winding
along
the
top
,
entering
above
,
and
then
passing
down
in
front
of
the
houses
,
thence
to
the
Vermejo
.
To
the
west
of
this
road
was
another
low
bluff
,
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
,
covered
with
scrub
oak
and
other
brush
.
As
they
were
riding
along
this
winding
road
on
the
bench
of
land
between
the
two
bluffs
,
a
volley
of
rifle
fire
suddenly
crashed
around
the
two
officers
.
Not
a
bullet
touched
Cook
who
was
nearer
the
ambush
,
but
one
hit
Russell
in
the
leg
and
another
broke
his
arm
,
passing
on
through
his
body
.
With
the
first
reports
,
Russell's
horse
wheeled
to
the
right
and
ran
towards
the
buildings
while
Cook
,
followed
by
a
hail
of
bullets
,
raced
towards
the
arroyo
of
Salyer's
Canyon
immediately
in
front
of
him
,
just
reaching
it
as
his
horse
fell
.
Grabbing
his
Winchester
from
its
sheath
,
Cook
prepared
to
fight
from
behind
the
arroyo
bank
.
Bullets
were
so
thick
,
throwing
sand
in
his
face
,
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
return
the
fire
.
Noticing
Russell's
horse
in
front
of
the
long
log
building
,
he
assumed
his
friend
had
slipped
inside
and
would
be
able
to
put
up
a
good
fight
,
so
he
began
working
his
way
down
the
ditch
to
join
him
.
At
a
very
shallow
place
,
two
Mexicans
rushed
into
the
open
for
a
shot
.
Dropping
to
one
knee
,
Cook
felled
one
,
and
the
other
struggled
off
with
his
comrade
,
sending
no
further
fire
in
his
direction
.
Just
before
leaving
the
arroyo
where
he
was
partially
concealed
,
he
did
hear
shots
down
at
the
house
.
Russell
had
reached
the
house
as
Cook
surmised
,
dismounted
,
but
just
as
the
old
trapper
opened
the
door
to
receive
him
,
he
fell
into
the
trapper's
arms
--
dead
.
A
bullet
fired
by
one
of
the
Mexicans
hiding
in
a
little
chicken
house
had
passed
through
his
head
,
tearing
a
hole
two-inches
square
on
the
outgoing
side
.
Finding
him
dead
,
Cook
caught
Russell's
horse
and
rode
to
the
cattle
foreman's
house
to
report
the
incident
and
request
bloodhounds
to
trail
the
assassins
.
Before
daylight
Sunday
morning
,
a
posse
of
twenty-three
men
under
the
leadership
of
Deputy
Sheriff
Frank
MacPherson
of
Catskill
followed
the
trail
to
the
house
of
Francisco
Chaves
,
where
100
to
150
Mexicans
had
gathered
.
MacPherson
boldly
approached
the
fortified
adobe
house
and
demanded
entrance
.
The
men
inside
informed
him
that
they
had
some
wounded
men
among
them
but
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
see
them
even
though
he
offered
medical
aid
.
The
officer
demanded
the
names
of
the
injured
men
;
;
the
Mexicans
not
only
refused
to
give
them
,
but
told
the
possemen
if
they
wanted
a
fight
they
could
have
it
.
Since
the
strength
of
the
Mexicans
had
been
underrated
,
too
small
a
posse
had
been
collected
,
and
since
the
deputy
had
not
been
provided
with
search
warrants
,
MacPherson
and
his
men
decided
it
was
much
wiser
to
withdraw
.
The
posse's
retreat
encouraged
the
Mexicans
to
be
overbearing
and
impudent
.
During
the
following
week
,
six
tons
of
hay
belonging
to
one
rancher
were
burned
;
;
some
buildings
,
farm
tools
,
two
horses
,
plows
,
and
hay
owned
by
Bonito
Lavato
,
a
friendly
interpreter
for
the
company
,
and
Pedro
Chavez'
hay
were
stolen
or
destroyed
;
;
and
a
store
was
broken
into
and
robbed
.
District
Attorney
M.
W.
Mills
warned
that
he
would
vigorously
prosecute
persons
caught
committing
these
crimes
or
carrying
arms
--
he
just
didn't
catch
anyone
.
Increasing
threats
on
his
life
finally
convinced
Cook
that
he
should
leave
New
Mexico
.
His
friends
advised
that
it
would
be
only
a
question
of
time
until
either
the
Mexicans
killed
him
by
ambuscade
or
he
would
be
compelled
to
kill
them
in
self-defense
,
perpetuating
the
troubles
.
By
early
summer
,
he
wrote
from
Laramie
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
wound
inflicted
in
the
ambush
and
was
in
a
bad
way
financially
,
so
Pels
sent
him
a
draft
for
$100
,
warning
that
it
was
still
not
wise
for
him
to
return
.
Pels
also
sent
a
check
for
$100
to
Russell's
widow
and
had
a
white
marble
monument
erected
on
his
grave
.
Cattle
stealing
and
killing
,
again
serious
during
the
spring
of
1891
,
placed
the
land
grant
company
officers
in
a
perplexing
position
.
They
were
reluctant
to
appoint
sheriffs
to
protect
the
property
,
thus
running
the
risk
of
creating
disturbances
such
as
that
on
the
Vermejo
,
and
yet
the
cowboys
protested
that
they
got
no
salary
for
arresting
cattle
thieves
and
running
the
risk
of
being
shot
.
And
the
law
virtually
ignored
the
situation
.
The
judge
became
ill
just
as
the
Colfax
District
Court
convened
,
no
substitute
was
brought
in
,
no
criminal
cases
heard
,
only
5
out
of
122
cases
docketed
were
tried
,
and
court
adjourned
sine
die
after
sitting
a
few
days
instead
of
the
usual
three
weeks
.
Pels
complained
:
``
Litigants
and
witnesses
were
put
to
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
going
long
distances
to
transact
business
;
;
public
money
spent
;
;
justice
delayed
;
;
nothing
accomplished
,
and
the
whole
distribution
of
justice
in
this
county
seems
to
be
an
absolute
farce
''
.
Word
reached
the
company
that
the
man
behind
these
depredations
was
Manuel
Gonzales
,
a
man
with
many
followers
,
including
a
number
who
were
kept
in
line
through
fear
of
him
.
Although
wanted
by
the
sheriff
for
killing
an
old
man
named
Asher
Jones
,
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
had
never
been
served
.
On
May
19
,
a
deputy
sheriff's
posse
of
eight
men
left
Maxwell
City
and
rode
thirty-five
miles
up
the
Vermejo
where
they
were
joined
by
Juan
Jose
Martinez
.
By
3:00
A.M.
they
reached
his
house
and
found
it
vacant
.
When
they
were
refused
entrance
to
his
brother's
house
nearby
,
they
smashed
down
the
door
,
broke
the
window
,
and
threw
lighted
clothes
wet
with
kerosene
into
the
room
.
Still
there
was
no
Gonzales
and
the
family
would
say
nothing
.
About
300
yards
up
the
creek
was
a
cluster
of
Mexican
houses
containing
six
rooms
in
the
form
of
a
square
.
While
prowling
around
these
buildings
,
two
of
the
posse
recognized
the
voice
of
Gonzales
speaking
to
the
people
inside
.
He
was
promised
that
no
harm
would
befall
him
if
he
would
come
out
,
but
he
cursed
and
replied
that
he
would
shoot
any
man
coming
near
the
door
.
The
posse
then
asked
that
he
send
out
the
women
and
children
as
the
building
would
be
fired
or
torn
down
over
his
head
if
necessary
to
take
him
dead
or
alive
.
Again
he
refused
.
In
deadly
earnest
,
the
besiegers
methodically
stripped
away
portions
of
the
roof
and
tossed
lighted
rags
inside
,
only
to
have
most
stamped
out
by
the
women
as
soon
as
they
hit
the
floor
.
When
it
became
obvious
that
he
could
stay
inside
no
longer
,
taking
a
thousand
to
one
chance
Gonzales
rushed
outside
,
square
against
the
muzzle
of
a
Winchester
.
Shot
near
the
heart
,
he
turned
to
one
side
and
plunged
for
a
door
to
another
room
several
feet
away
,
three
bullets
following
him
.
As
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
fell
on
his
face
,
one
of
his
comrades
pulling
him
inside
.
Not
realizing
the
seriousness
of
the
wound
,
the
besiegers
warned
that
if
he
did
not
surrender
the
house
would
be
burned
down
around
him
.
Receiving
no
answer
,
they
set
the
fire
.
When
the
house
was
about
half
consumed
,
his
comrade
ran
to
the
door
and
threw
up
his
hands
,
declaring
repeatedly
that
he
did
not
know
the
whereabouts
of
Manuel
.
Finding
it
true
that
he
was
not
inside
,
the
deputies
returned
to
the
first
house
and
tore
holes
through
the
side
and
the
roof
until
they
could
see
a
body
on
the
bed
covered
by
a
blanket
.
Several
slugs
fired
into
the
bed
jerked
aside
the
blanket
to
reveal
an
apparently
lifeless
hand
.
Shot
six
or
eight
times
the
body
was
draped
with
Russell's
pistol
,
belt
,
and
cartridges
.
There
was
no
extra
horse
so
it
was
left
to
his
comrades
who
,
though
numbering
in
the
fifties
,
had
stood
around
on
the
hillside
nearby
without
firing
a
shot
during
the
entire
attack
.
Early
the
next
morning
,
a
Mexican
telephoned
Pels
that
Celso
Chavez
,
one
of
the
posse
members
,
was
surrounded
by
ten
Mexicans
at
his
father's
home
on
the
upper
Vermejo
.
The
sheriff
and
District
Attorney
Mills
hastily
swore
out
a
number
of
warrants
against
men
who
had
been
riding
about
armed
,
according
to
signed
statements
by
Chavez
and
Dr.
I.
P.
George
,
and
ordered
Deputy
Barney
Clark
of
Raton
to
rescue
the
posseman
.
Traveling
all
night
,
Clark
and
twelve
men
arrived
at
about
seven
o'clock
May
22
.
Occasionally
they
heard
gun-shot
signals
and
a
number
of
horsemen
were
sighted
on
the
hills
,
disappearing
at
the
posse's
approach
.
A
Mexican
justice
of
the
peace
had
issue
a
writ
against
Chavez
for
taking
part
in
the
``
murder
''
of
Manuel
Gonzales
so
he
and
his
father
were
anxious
to
be
taken
out
of
danger
.
The
men
helped
them
gather
their
belongings
and
escorted
them
to
Raton
along
with
three
other
families
desiring
to
leave
.
The
ten
or
more
dangerous
parties
singled
out
for
prosecution
were
still
at
large
,
and
Pels
realized
that
if
these
men
entrenched
themselves
in
their
adobe
houses
,
defending
themselves
through
loopholes
,
it
would
be
most
difficult
to
capture
them
.
Thus
he
wired
J.
P.
Lower
and
Sons
of
Denver
:
``
Have
you
any
percussion
hand
grenades
for
throwing
in
a
house
or
across
a
well
loaded
with
balls
or
shrapnel
shot
?
?
If
not
,
how
long
to
order
and
what
is
the
price
''
?
?
He
wisely
decided
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
create
a
disturbance
during
the
coming
roundup
,
particularly
since
the
Mexicans
were
on
their
guard
.
His
problem
then
became
one
of
restraining
the
American
fighters
who
wanted
to
clean
out
the
Vermejo
by
force
immediately
.
The
plant
was
located
west
of
the
Battenkill
and
south
of
the
location
of
the
former
electric
light
plant
.
The
Manchester
Depot
Sewer
Company
issued
214
shares
of
stock
at
$10
each
for
construction
of
a
sewer
in
that
locality
,
and
assessments
were
made
for
its
maintenance
.
It
has
given
considerable
trouble
at
times
and
empties
right
into
the
Battenkill
.
Fire
District
No.
1
discussed
its
possible
purchase
in
1945
,
but
considered
it
an
unwise
investment
.
The
sewer
on
Bonnet
Street
was
constructed
when
there
were
only
a
few
houses
on
the
street
.
As
new
homes
were
built
they
were
connected
so
that
all
residences
south
of
School
Street
are
served
by
it
.
B.
J.
Connell
is
the
present
treasurer
and
manager
.
The
1946
town
meeting
voted
to
have
the
Selectmen
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
and
report
on
the
feasibility
of
some
system
of
sewage
disposal
and
a
disposal
plant
to
serve
Manchester
Center
,
Depot
,
and
Way's
Lane
.
The
committee
submitted
a
report
signed
by
Louis
Martin
and
Leon
Wiley
with
a
map
published
in
the
1946
town
report
.
The
layout
of
the
sewer
lines
was
designed
by
Henry
W.
Taylor
,
who
was
the
engineer
for
the
Manchester
Village
disposal
plant
.
No
figures
were
submitted
with
the
report
and
no
action
was
taken
on
it
by
the
town
.
The
1958
town
meeting
directed
town
authorities
to
seek
federal
and
state
funds
with
which
to
conduct
a
preliminary
survey
of
a
proposed
sewage
plant
with
its
attendant
facilities
.
The
final
step
was
a
vote
for
a
$230,000
bond
issue
for
the
construction
of
a
sewage
system
by
the
1959
town
meeting
,
later
confirmed
by
a
two-thirds
vote
at
a
special
town
meeting
June
21
,
1960
.
There
the
matter
stands
with
the
prospect
that
soon
Manchester
may
be
removed
from
the
roster
of
towns
contributing
raw
sewage
to
its
main
streams
.
Telephone
and
telegraph
Manchester's
unusual
interest
in
telegraphy
has
often
been
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
Rev.
J.
D.
Wickham
,
headmaster
of
Burr
and
Burton
Seminary
,
was
a
personal
friend
and
correspondent
of
the
inventor
,
Samuel
F.
B.
Morse
.
At
any
rate
,
Manchester
did
not
lag
far
behind
the
first
commercial
system
which
was
set
up
in
1844
between
Baltimore
and
Washington
.
In
1846
Matthew
B.
Goodwin
,
jeweler
and
watchmaker
,
became
the
town's
first
telegrapher
in
a
dwelling
he
built
for
himself
and
his
business
``
two
doors
north
of
the
Equinox
House
''
or
``
one
door
north
of
the
Bank
,
Manchester
,
Vermont
''
.
Goodwin
was
telegrapher
for
the
``
American
Telegraph
Company
''
and
the
``
Troy
and
Canada
Junction
Telegraph
Company
''
.
Shares
of
capital
stock
at
$15
each
in
the
latter
company
were
payable
at
the
Bank
of
Manchester
or
at
various
other
Vermont
banks
.
A
message
of
less
than
fifteen
words
to
Bennington
cost
twenty-five
cents
.
By
1871
L.
C.
Orvis
,
manager
of
the
``
Western
Union
Telegraph
Company
''
,
expressed
willingness
to
send
emergency
telegrams
on
Sundays
from
his
Village
drugstore
.
Orvis
even
needed
to
hire
an
assistant
,
Clark
J.
Wait
.
The
Manchester
Journal
commented
editorially
on
the
surprising
amount
of
local
telegraphic
business
.
In
the
fall
of
1878
,
the
``
Popular
Telegraph
Line
''
was
established
between
Manchester
and
Factory
Point
by
the
owners
,
Paul
W.
Orvis
,
Henry
Gray
,
J.
N.
Hard
,
and
Clark
J.
Wait
.
The
line
soon
lived
up
to
its
name
,
as
local
messages
of
moderate
length
could
be
sent
for
a
dime
and
the
company
was
quickly
able
to
declare
very
liberal
dividends
on
its
capital
stock
.
In
1879
the
same
Clark
Wait
,
with
H.
H.
Holley
of
South
Dorset
,
formed
the
``
American
Telegraph
Line
''
,
extending
from
Manchester
Depot
via
Factory
Point
and
South
Dorset
to
Dorset
.
Besides
being
most
convenient
,
the
line
``
soon
proved
a
good
investment
for
the
owners
''
.
Telegraphers
at
the
Depot
at
this
time
were
Aaron
C.
Burr
and
Mark
Manley
of
``
Burr
and
Manley
''
,
dealers
in
lumber
and
dry
goods
.
Early
equipment
was
very
flimsy
;
;
the
smallest
gusts
of
wind
toppled
poles
,
making
communications
impossible
.
But
companies
continued
to
spring
up
.
By
1883
the
``
Battenkill
Telegraph
Company
''
was
in
existence
and
Alvin
Pettibone
was
its
president
.
Operating
in
1887
was
the
``
Valley
Telegraph
Line
''
,
officers
of
which
were
E.
C.
Orvis
,
president
;
;
H.
K.
Fowler
,
vice-president
and
secretary
;
;
J.
N.
Hard
,
treasurer
;
;
F.
H.
Walker
,
superintendent
;
;
H.
S.
Walker
,
assistant
superintendent
.
Two
companies
now
had
headquarters
with
Clark
J.
Wait
,
who
by
then
had
his
own
drugstore
at
Factory
Point
--
the
``
Northern
Union
Telegraph
Company
''
and
the
``
Western
Union
''
.
Operators
were
Arthur
Koop
and
Norman
Taylor
.
Still
existing
on
a
``
Northern
Union
''
telegraph
form
is
a
typical
peremptory
message
from
Peru
grocer
J.
J.
Hapgood
to
Burton
and
Graves'
store
in
Manchester
--
``
Get
and
send
by
stage
four
pounds
best
Porterhouse
or
serloin
stake
,
for
Mrs.
Hapgood
send
six
sweet
oranges
''
.
About
1888
J.
E.
McNaughton
of
Barnumville
and
E.
G.
Bacon
became
proprietors
of
the
``
Green
Mountain
Telegraph
Company
''
,
connecting
all
offices
on
the
Western
Union
line
and
extending
over
the
mountain
from
Barnumville
to
Peru
,
Londonderry
,
South
Londonderry
,
Lowell
Lake
,
Windham
,
North
Windham
,
Grafton
,
Cambridgeport
,
Saxton's
River
,
and
Bellows
Falls
.
From
1896
until
1910
John
H.
Whipple
was
manager
of
Western
Union
at
the
Center
in
the
drugstore
he
purchased
from
Clark
Wait
.
The
Village
office
of
Western
Union
with
George
Towsley
as
manager
and
telegrapher
continued
in
Hard's
drugstore
until
1905
.
During
the
summers
,
Towsley
often
needed
the
assistance
of
a
company
operator
.
These
were
the
years
when
people
flocked
to
Manchester
not
only
to
play
golf
,
which
had
come
into
vogue
,
but
also
to
witness
the
Ekwanok
Country
Club
tournaments
.
New
Yorkers
were
kept
informed
of
scores
by
reporters
who
telegraphed
fifteen
to
twenty
thousand
words
daily
to
the
metropolitan
newspapers
.
This
boosted
local
telegraph
business
and
Manchester
basked
in
all
the
free
advertising
.
In
1914
when
the
town
was
chosen
for
the
U.
S.
Amateur
Golf
tournament
,
a
representative
hurried
here
from
the
Boston
manager's
office
.
In
his
wake
came
the
District
Traffic
Supervisor
and
the
cream
of
the
telegraphic
profession
,
ten
of
Boston's
best
,
chosen
for
their
long
experience
and
thorough
knowledge
of
golf
.
During
that
tournament
alone
,
some
250,000
words
winged
their
way
out
of
Manchester
.
The
old
Morse
system
was
replaced
locally
by
the
Simplex
modern
automatic
method
in
1929
,
when
Ellamae
Heckman
(
Wilcox
)
was
manager
of
the
Western
Union
office
.
During
summers
,
business
was
so
brisk
that
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
two
assistants
and
a
messenger
.
She
was
succeeded
by
Clarence
Goyette
.
Since
that
time
the
telegraph
office
has
shifted
in
location
from
the
railroad
station
at
the
Depot
and
shops
at
the
Center
back
to
the
town
clerk's
office
and
drugstore
at
the
Village
.
After
being
located
for
some
years
in
the
Village
at
the
Equinox
Pharmacy
under
the
supervision
of
Mrs.
Harry
Mercier
,
it
is
presently
located
in
the
Hill
and
Dale
Shop
,
Manchester
Center
.
The
first
known
telephone
line
in
Manchester
was
established
in
July
1883
between
Burr
and
Manley's
store
at
Manchester
Depot
and
the
Kent
and
Root
Marble
Company
in
South
Dorset
.
This
was
extended
the
following
year
to
include
the
railroad
station
agent's
office
and
Thayer's
Hotel
at
Factory
Point
.
In
November
1887
a
line
connecting
several
dwelling
houses
in
Dorset
was
extended
to
Manchester
Depot
.
Telephone
wires
from
Louis
Dufresne's
house
in
East
Manchester
to
the
Dufresne
lumber
job
near
Bourn
Pond
were
up
about
1895
.
Eber
L.
Taylor
of
Manchester
Depot
recorded
the
setting
of
phone
poles
in
East
Dorset
and
Barnumville
in
his
diary
for
1906
.
These
must
have
been
for
local
calls
strictly
,
as
in
May
1900
the
``
only
long
distance
telephone
''
in
town
was
transferred
from
C.
B.
Carleton's
to
Young's
shoe
store
.
A
small
single
switchboard
was
installed
in
the
Village
over
Woodcock's
hardware
store
(
later
E.
H.
Hemenway's
)
.
George
Woodcock
was
manager
and
troubleshooter
;
;
Elizabeth
Way
was
the
first
operator
;
;
and
a
night
operator
was
also
employed
.
Anyone
fortunate
enough
to
have
one
of
those
early
phones
advertised
the
fact
along
with
the
telephone
number
in
the
Manchester
Journal
.
In
1918
the
New
England
Telephone
Company
began
erecting
a
building
to
house
its
operations
on
the
corner
of
U.
S.
Rte.
7
and
what
is
now
Memorial
Avenue
at
Manchester
Center
.
Service
running
through
Barnumville
and
to
Bennington
County
towns
east
of
the
mountains
was
in
the
hands
of
the
``
Gleason
Telephone
Company
''
in
1925
,
but
major
supervision
of
telephone
lines
in
Manchester
was
with
the
New
England
Telephone
and
Telegraph
Company
,
which
eventually
gained
all
control
.
More
aerial
and
underground
equipment
was
installed
as
well
as
office
improvements
to
take
care
of
the
expanding
business
.
In
1931
Mrs.
F.
H.
Briggs
,
agent
and
chief
operator
,
who
was
to
retire
in
1946
with
thirty
years'
service
,
led
agency
offices
in
sales
for
the
year
with
$2,490
.
William
Hitchcock
,
who
retired
in
1938
,
was
a
veteran
of
thirty-four
years'
local
service
.
Another
veteran
telephone
operator
was
Edith
Fleming
Blackmer
,
who
had
been
in
the
office
forty
years
at
the
time
of
her
death
in
1960
.
In
1932
Dorset
received
its
own
exchange
,
which
made
business
easier
for
the
Manchester
office
,
but
it
was
not
until
February
1953
that
area
service
was
extended
to
include
Manchester
and
Dorset
.
This
eliminated
toll
calls
between
the
two
towns
.
Within
a
month
,
calls
were
up
seventy
per
cent
.
Electric
power
electricity
plays
such
an
important
part
in
community
life
today
that
it
is
difficult
to
envision
a
time
when
current
was
not
available
for
daily
use
.
Yet
one
has
to
go
back
only
some
sixty
years
.
The
first
mention
of
an
electric
plant
in
Manchester
seems
to
be
one
installed
in
Reuben
Colvin's
and
Houghton's
gristmill
on
the
West
Branch
in
Factory
Point
.
No
records
are
available
as
to
the
date
or
extent
of
installation
,
but
it
may
have
been
in
1896
.
On
June
14
,
1900
the
Manchester
Journal
reported
that
an
electrical
engineer
was
installing
an
electric
light
plant
for
Edward
S.
Isham
at
``
Ormsby
Hill
''
.
This
was
working
by
the
end
of
August
and
giving
satisfactory
service
.
In
November
1900
surveying
was
done
under
John
Marsden
on
the
east
mountains
to
ascertain
if
it
would
be
possible
to
get
sufficient
water
and
fall
to
operate
an
electric
power
plant
.
Nothing
came
of
it
,
perhaps
due
to
lack
of
opportunity
for
water
storage
.
The
next
step
was
construction
by
the
Manchester
Light
and
Power
Company
of
a
plant
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Battenkill
south
of
Union
Street
bridge
.
This
was
nearly
completed
May
23
,
1901
with
a
promise
of
lights
by
June
10
,
but
the
first
light
did
not
go
on
until
September
28
.
It
was
at
the
end
of
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
Dellwood
Cemetery
cottage
.
The
first
directors
of
the
Manchester
Light
and
Power
Company
were
John
Marsden
,
M.
L.
Manley
,
William
F.
Orvis
,
George
Smith
,
and
John
Blackmer
.
The
officers
were
John
Marsden
,
president
;
;
John
C.
Blackmer
,
vice-president
;
;
George
Smith
,
treasurer
;
;
and
William
F.
Orvis
,
secretary
.
Marsden
was
manager
of
the
company
for
ten
years
and
manager
of
its
successor
company
,
the
Colonial
Light
and
Power
Company
,
for
one
year
.
At
about
the
time
the
Marsden
enterprise
was
getting
under
way
,
the
Vail
Light
and
Lumber
Company
started
construction
of
a
chair
stock
factory
on
the
site
of
the
present
Bennington
Co-operative
Creamery
,
intending
to
use
its
surplus
power
for
generating
electricity
.
Manchester
then
had
two
competing
power
companies
until
1904
,
when
the
Manchester
Light
and
Power
Company
purchased
the
transmission
system
of
the
Vail
Company
.
This
was
fortunate
,
as
the
Vail
plant
burned
in
1905
.
The
Colonial
Light
and
Power
Company
was
succeeded
by
the
Vermont
Hydro-Electric
Corporation
,
which
in
turn
was
absorbed
by
the
Central
Vermont
Public
Service
Corporation
.
The
latter
now
furnishes
the
area
with
electricity
distributed
from
a
modern
sub-station
at
Manchester
Depot
which
was
put
into
operation
February
19
,
1930
and
was
improved
in
January
1942
by
the
installation
of
larger
transformers
.
For
a
time
following
the
abandonment
of
the
local
plant
,
electric
current
for
Manchester
was
brought
in
from
the
south
with
an
emergency
tie-in
with
the
Vermont
Marble
Company
system
to
the
north
.
Some
who
have
written
on
Utopia
have
treated
it
as
``
a
learned
diversion
of
a
learned
world
''
,
``
a
phantasy
with
which
More
amused
himself
''
,
``
a
holiday
work
,
a
spontaneous
overflow
of
intellectual
high
spirits
,
a
revel
of
debate
,
paradox
,
comedy
and
invention
''
.
With
respect
to
this
view
,
two
points
are
worth
making
.
First
,
it
appears
to
be
based
on
the
fact
that
on
its
title
page
Utopia
is
described
as
``
festivus
''
,
``
gay
''
.
It
overlooks
the
other
fact
that
it
is
described
as
``
Nec
minus
salutaris
quam
festivus
''
,
``
no
less
salutary
than
gay
''
.
It
also
overlooks
the
fact
that
in
a
rational
lexicon
,
and
quite
clearly
in
More's
lexicon
,
the
opposite
of
serious
is
not
gay
but
frivolous
,
and
the
opposite
of
gay
is
not
serious
but
solemn
.
More
believed
that
a
man
could
be
both
serious
and
gay
.
That
a
writer
who
is
gay
cannot
be
serious
is
a
common
professional
illusion
,
sedulously
fostered
by
all
too
many
academics
who
mistakenly
believe
that
their
frivolous
efforts
should
be
taken
seriously
because
they
are
expressed
with
that
dreary
solemnity
which
is
the
only
mode
of
expression
their
authors
are
capable
of
.
Secondly
,
to
find
a
learned
diversion
and
a
pleasing
joke
in
More's
account
of
the
stupid
brutalities
of
early
sixteenth
century
wars
,
of
the
anguish
of
the
poor
and
dispossessed
,
of
the
insolence
and
cruelty
of
the
rich
and
powerful
requires
a
callousness
toward
suffering
and
sin
that
would
be
surprising
in
a
moral
imbecile
and
most
surprising
in
More
himself
.
Indeed
,
it
is
even
surprising
in
the
Canon
of
Christ
Church
and
Regius
Professor
of
Ecclesiastical
History
,
who
fathered
this
most
peculiar
view
,
and
in
the
brilliant
Professor
of
Medieval
and
Renaissance
English
at
Cambridge
,
who
inherited
it
and
is
now
its
most
eminent
proponent
.
But
to
return
to
the
main
line
of
our
inquiry
,
it
is
doubtful
that
Utopia
is
still
widely
read
because
More
was
medieval
or
even
because
he
was
a
martyr
--
indeed
,
it
is
likely
that
these
days
many
who
read
Utopia
with
interest
do
not
even
know
that
its
author
was
a
martyr
.
Utopia
is
still
widely
read
because
in
a
sense
More
stood
on
the
margin
of
modernity
.
And
if
he
did
stand
on
the
margins
of
modernity
,
it
was
not
in
dying
a
martyr
for
such
unity
as
Papal
supremacy
might
be
able
to
force
on
Western
Christendom
.
It
was
not
even
in
writing
Latin
epigrams
,
sometimes
bawdy
ones
,
or
in
translating
Lucian
from
Greek
into
Latin
or
in
defending
the
study
of
Greek
against
the
attack
of
conservative
academics
,
or
in
attacking
the
conservative
theologians
who
opposed
Erasmus's
philological
study
of
the
New
Testament
.
Similar
literary
exercises
were
the
common
doings
of
a
Christian
humanist
of
the
first
two
decades
of
the
sixteenth
century
.
Had
More's
writings
been
wholly
limited
to
such
exercises
,
they
would
be
almost
as
dimly
remembered
as
those
of
a
dozen
or
so
other
authors
living
in
his
time
,
whose
works
tenuously
survive
in
the
minds
of
the
few
hundred
scholars
who
each
decade
in
pursuit
of
their
very
specialized
occasions
read
those
works
.
More
stands
on
the
margins
of
modernity
for
one
reason
alone
--
because
he
wrote
Utopia
.
And
the
evidence
that
he
does
,
indeed
,
stand
there
derives
quite
simply
from
the
vigorous
interest
with
which
rather
casual
readers
have
responded
to
that
book
for
the
past
century
or
so
.
Only
one
other
contemporary
of
More's
evokes
so
immediate
and
direct
a
response
,
and
only
one
other
contemporary
work
--
Niccolo
Machiavelli
and
The
Prince
.
Can
we
discover
what
it
is
in
Utopia
that
has
evoked
this
response
?
?
Remember
that
in
seeking
the
modern
in
Utopia
we
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
the
medieval
and
the
Renaissance
there
;
;
we
do
not
even
need
to
commit
ourselves
to
assessing
on
the
same
inconceivable
scale
the
relative
importance
of
the
medieval
,
the
Renaissance
,
and
the
modern
.
The
medieval
was
the
most
important
to
Chambers
because
he
sought
to
place
Thomas
More
,
the
author
of
Utopia
,
in
some
intelligible
relation
with
St.
Thomas
More
,
the
martyr
.
To
others
whose
concern
it
is
to
penetrate
the
significance
of
Christian
Humanism
,
the
Renaissance
elements
are
of
primary
concern
.
But
here
we
have
a
distinctly
modern
preoccupation
;
;
we
want
to
know
why
that
book
has
kept
on
selling
the
way
it
has
;
;
we
want
to
know
what
is
perennially
new
about
Utopia
.
What
is
new
about
it
?
?
To
that
question
the
answer
is
simple
;
;
it
can
be
made
in
two
words
,
Utopian
communism
.
But
it
is
an
answer
which
opens
the
door
wide
to
an
onrush
of
objections
and
denials
.
Surely
there
is
nothing
new
about
communism
.
We
find
it
in
Plato's
Republic
,
and
in
Utopia
More
acknowledges
his
debt
to
that
book
.
We
find
it
in
that
``
common
way
of
life
pleasing
to
Christ
and
still
in
use
among
the
truest
societies
of
Christians
''
,
that
is
,
the
better
monasteries
which
made
it
easier
to
convert
the
Utopians
to
Christianity
.
We
find
it
in
the
later
Stoic
conception
of
man's
natural
condition
which
included
the
community
of
all
possessions
.
This
conception
was
taken
up
by
the
early
Church
Fathers
and
by
canon
lawyers
and
theologians
in
the
Middle
Ages
;
;
and
More
was
far
too
well
read
not
to
have
come
across
it
in
one
or
several
of
the
forms
thus
given
it
.
But
although
the
idea
of
communism
is
very
old
even
in
More's
day
and
did
not
spring
full-clad
from
his
imagination
in
1515
,
it
is
not
communism
as
such
that
we
are
concerned
with
.
We
are
concerned
not
with
the
genus
communism
nor
with
other
species
of
the
genus
:
Platonic
,
Stoic
,
early
Christian
,
monastic
,
canonist
or
theological
communism
;
;
we
are
concerned
with
Utopian
communism
--
that
is
,
simply
communism
as
it
appears
in
the
imaginary
commonwealth
of
Utopia
,
as
More
conceived
it
.
Perhaps
one
way
to
sharpen
our
sense
of
the
modernity
of
Utopian
communism
is
to
contrast
it
with
the
principal
earlier
types
of
communistic
theory
.
We
will
achieve
a
more
vivid
sense
of
what
it
is
by
realizing
what
it
is
not
.
In
Plato's
Republic
communism
is
--
to
speak
anachronistically
--
a
communism
of
Janissaries
.
Its
function
is
to
separate
from
the
base
ruled
mass
,
among
whom
private
ownership
prevails
,
the
governing
warrior
elite
.
Moreover
,
it
is
too
readily
forgotten
that
in
the
Republic
what
gave
the
initial
impetus
to
Plato's
excursus
into
the
construction
of
an
imaginary
commonwealth
with
its
ruling-class
communism
of
goods
,
wives
,
and
children
,
was
his
quest
for
a
canon
for
the
proper
ordering
of
the
individual
human
psyche
;
;
and
it
is
to
this
problem
that
the
Republic
ultimately
returns
.
In
More's
Utopia
communism
is
not
a
means
of
separating
out
a
warrior
elite
from
the
lumpish
mass
.
Utopian
communism
applies
to
all
Utopians
.
And
in
the
economy
of
the
book
it
is
not
peripheral
but
central
.
The
concern
of
Utopia
is
with
the
optimo
reipublicae
statu
,
the
best
ordering
of
a
civil
society
;
;
and
it
is
again
and
again
made
clear
that
Utopian
communism
provides
the
institutional
array
indispensible
to
that
best
ordering
.
To
derive
Utopian
communism
from
the
Jerusalem
Christian
community
of
the
apostolic
age
or
from
its
medieval
successors-in-spirit
,
the
monastic
communities
,
is
with
an
appropriate
shift
of
adjectives
,
misleading
in
the
same
way
as
to
derive
it
from
Plato's
Republic
:
in
the
Republic
we
have
to
do
with
an
elite
of
physical
and
intellectual
athletes
,
in
the
apostolic
and
monastic
communities
with
an
elite
of
spiritual
and
religious
athletes
.
The
apostolic
community
was
literally
an
elite
:
chosen
by
Christ
himself
.
And
the
monastic
communities
were
supposed
to
be
made
up
of
volunteers
selected
only
after
a
novitiate
which
would
test
their
religious
aptitude
for
monastic
rigors
,
their
spiritual
athleticism
.
Finally
,
the
conception
of
the
natural
community
of
all
possessions
which
originated
with
the
Stoics
was
firmly
fixed
in
a
tradition
by
More's
time
,
although
it
was
not
accepted
by
all
the
theologian-philosophers
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
In
that
tradition
communism
lay
a
safe
distance
back
in
the
age
of
innocence
before
the
Fall
of
Man
.
It
did
not
serve
to
contrast
the
existing
order
of
society
with
a
possible
alternative
order
,
because
the
age
of
innocence
was
not
a
possible
alternative
once
man
had
sinned
.
The
actual
function
of
patristic
communism
was
adequately
set
forth
by
St.
Gregory
almost
a
millenium
before
More
wrote
Utopia
.
``
The
soil
is
common
to
all
men
.
When
we
give
the
necessities
of
life
to
the
poor
,
we
restore
to
them
what
is
already
theirs
.
We
should
think
of
it
more
as
an
act
of
justice
than
compassion
''
.
Because
community
not
severalty
of
property
is
the
law
of
nature
no
man
can
assert
an
absolutely
unalterable
right
to
what
is
his
.
Indeed
,
of
all
that
is
his
every
man
is
by
nature
and
reason
and
therefore
by
conscience
obligated
to
regard
himself
as
a
custodian
.
He
is
a
trustee
for
the
common
good
,
however
feeble
the
safeguards
which
the
positive
or
municipal
law
of
property
provides
against
his
misuse
of
that
share
of
the
common
fund
,
wisely
or
unwisely
,
entrusted
to
his
keeping
.
In
contrast
to
this
Stoic-patristic
view
,
Utopia
implies
that
the
nature
of
man
is
such
that
to
rely
on
individual
conscience
to
supply
the
deficiencies
of
municipal
law
is
to
embark
on
the
bottomless
sea
of
human
sinfulness
in
a
sieve
.
The
Utopians
brace
conscience
with
legal
sanctions
.
In
a
properly
ordered
society
the
massive
force
of
public
law
performs
the
function
which
in
natural
law
theory
ineptly
is
left
altogether
to
a
small
voice
so
often
still
.
In
all
the
respects
just
indicated
Utopian
communism
differs
from
previous
conceptions
in
which
community
of
possessions
and
living
plays
a
role
.
Neither
from
one
of
these
conceptions
nor
from
a
combination
of
them
can
it
be
deduced
.
We
do
not
deny
originality
to
the
Agamemnon
because
Aeschylus
found
the
tales
of
the
house
of
Atreus
among
the
folk
lore
of
the
Greeks
.
In
a
like
sense
whatever
bits
or
shreds
of
previous
conceptions
one
may
find
in
it
,
Utopian
communism
remains
,
as
an
integral
whole
,
original
--
a
new
thing
.
It
is
not
merely
a
new
thing
;
;
it
is
one
of
the
very
few
new
things
in
Utopia
;
;
most
of
the
rest
is
medieval
or
humanist
or
part
of
an
old
tradition
of
social
criticism
.
But
to
say
that
at
a
moment
in
history
something
is
new
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
it
is
modern
;
;
and
for
this
statement
the
best
evidence
comes
within
the
five
years
following
the
publication
of
Utopia
,
when
Martin
Luther
elaborates
a
new
perception
of
the
nature
of
the
Divine's
encounter
with
man
.
New
,
indeed
,
is
Luther's
perception
,
but
not
modern
,
as
anyone
knows
who
has
ever
tried
to
make
intelligible
to
modern
students
what
Luther
was
getting
at
.
Although
Utopian
communism
is
both
new
in
1516
and
also
modern
,
it
is
not
modern
communism
or
even
modern
socialism
,
as
they
exist
or
have
ever
existed
in
theory
or
in
practice
.
Consider
the
features
of
Utopian
communism
:
generous
public
provision
for
the
infirm
;
;
democratic
and
secret
elections
of
all
officers
including
priests
,
meals
taken
publicly
in
common
refectories
;
;
a
common
habit
or
uniform
prescribed
for
all
citizens
;
;
even
houses
changed
once
a
decade
;
;
six
hours
of
manual
labor
a
day
for
all
but
a
handful
of
magistrates
and
scholars
,
and
careful
measures
to
prevent
anyone
from
shirking
;
;
no
private
property
,
no
money
;
;
no
sort
of
pricing
at
all
for
any
goods
or
services
,
and
therefore
no
market
in
the
economic
sense
of
the
term
.
Whatever
the
merits
of
its
intent
,
Utopian
communism
is
far
too
naive
,
far
too
crude
,
to
suit
any
modern
socialist
or
communist
.
It
is
not
the
details
of
Utopian
communism
that
make
Utopia
modern
,
it
is
the
spirit
,
the
attitude
of
mind
that
informs
those
details
.
What
that
spirit
and
attitude
were
we
can
best
understand
if
we
see
more
precisely
how
it
contrasts
with
the
communist
tradition
with
the
longest
continuous
history
,
the
one
which
reached
Christianity
by
the
way
of
Stoicism
through
the
Church
Fathers
of
Late
Antiquity
.
During
the
Dorr
trial
the
Democratic
press
condemned
the
proceedings
and
heralded
Dorr
as
a
martyr
to
the
principles
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
.
During
the
Brown
trial
,
however
,
the
state's
most
powerful
Democratic
newspaper
,
the
Providence
Daily
Post
,
stated
that
Brown
was
a
murderer
,
a
man
of
blood
,
and
that
he
and
his
associates
,
with
the
assistance
of
Republicans
and
Abolitionists
,
had
plotted
not
only
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
but
also
the
overthrow
of
state
and
federal
governments
.
The
Providence
Daily
Journal
answered
the
Daily
Post
by
stating
that
the
raid
of
John
Brown
was
characteristic
of
Democratic
acts
of
violence
and
that
``
He
was
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
Republican
Party
,
who
proclaim
as
one
of
their
cardinal
principles
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
states
''
.
The
two
major
newspapers
in
Providence
continued
,
throughout
the
crisis
,
to
accuse
each
other
of
misrepresenting
the
facts
and
attempting
to
falsify
history
.
While
the
Daily
Post
continued
to
accuse
Republicans
and
the
Daily
Journal
continued
to
accuse
Democrats
,
the
Woonsocket
Patriot
complained
that
the
Virginia
authorities
showed
indecent
and
cowardly
haste
to
condemn
Brown
and
his
men
.
Editor
Foss
stated
,
``
Of
their
guilt
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
time
to
prepare
for
trial
,
and
a
fair
trial
''
.
The
Providence
Daily
Post
thought
that
there
were
probably
good
reasons
for
the
haste
in
which
the
trial
was
being
conducted
and
that
the
only
thing
gained
by
a
delay
would
be
calmer
feelings
.
The
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
the
guilt
of
Brown
was
evident
,
the
South
must
guarantee
him
a
fair
trial
to
preserve
domestic
peace
.
On
October
31
,
1859
,
John
Brown
was
found
guilty
of
treason
against
the
state
of
Virginia
,
inciting
slave
rebellion
,
and
murder
.
For
these
crimes
he
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
in
public
on
Friday
,
December
2
,
1859
.
Upon
receiving
the
news
,
Northern
writers
,
editors
,
and
clergymen
heaped
accusations
of
murder
on
the
Southern
states
,
particularly
Virginia
.
Although
Rhode
Islanders
were
preparing
for
the
state
elections
,
they
watched
John
Brown's
trial
with
extreme
interest
.
On
Wednesday
morning
,
November
2
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
Brown
justly
deserved
the
extreme
penalty
,
no
man
,
however
criminal
,
ought
to
suffer
the
penalty
without
a
fair
trial
.
The
editor's
main
criticism
of
the
trial
was
the
haste
with
which
it
was
conducted
.
The
readers
of
the
Providence
Daily
Post
,
however
,
learned
that
it
was
generally
conceded
that
``
Old
Brown
''
had
a
fair
trial
.
Concerning
the
sentence
the
editor
asked
,
``
What
else
can
Virginia
do
than
to
hang
the
men
who
have
defied
her
laws
,
organized
treason
,
and
butchered
her
citizens
''
.
In
the
eastern
section
of
the
state
the
newspapers'
reaction
to
Brown's
trial
and
sentence
were
basically
identical
.
J.
Wheaton
Smith
,
editor
of
the
Warren
Telegraph
stated
that
``
the
ends
of
justice
must
be
satisfied
,
a
solitary
example
must
be
set
,
in
order
that
all
those
misnamed
philantropists
,
who
,
actuated
by
a
blind
zeal
,
dare
to
instigate
riot
,
treason
,
and
murder
,
may
heed
it
and
shape
their
future
course
accordingly
''
.
The
editor
of
the
Newport
Advertiser
could
discover
no
evidence
of
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
Brown
trial
which
would
warrant
making
an
exception
to
the
infliction
of
capital
punishment
.
In
direct
contrast
to
the
other
Rhode
Island
editors
,
Samuel
S.
Foss
of
the
Woonsocket
Patriot
outwardly
condemned
the
trial
as
being
completely
unfair
.
Concerning
the
sentence
,
Foss
wrote
,
``
If
it
be
possible
that
mercy
shall
override
vengeance
and
that
John
Brown's
sentence
shall
be
commuted
to
imprisonment
,
it
would
be
well
--
well
for
the
country
and
for
Virginia
''
.
Despite
the
excitement
being
caused
by
the
trial
and
sentence
of
John
Brown
,
Rhode
Islanders
turned
their
attention
to
the
state
elections
.
The
state
had
elected
Republican
candidates
in
the
past
two
years
.
There
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
control
the
Republican
party
exercised
throughout
the
state
.
If
it
failed
on
occasion
to
elect
its
candidates
for
general
state
offices
by
majorities
,
the
failure
was
due
to
a
lingering
remnant
of
the
Know-Nothing
party
,
which
called
itself
the
American
Republican
party
.
The
American
Republicans
and
the
Republicans
both
nominated
Lieutenant-Governor
Turner
for
governor
.
Elisha
R.
Potter
was
the
Democratic
candidate
.
The
results
of
the
election
of
1859
found
Republican
candidates
not
only
winning
the
offices
of
governor
and
lieutenant-governor
but
also
obtaining
the
two
Congressional
offices
from
the
eastern
and
western
sections
of
the
state
.
During
the
month
of
November
hardly
a
day
passed
when
there
was
not
some
mention
of
John
Brown
in
the
Rhode
Island
newspapers
.
On
November
7
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
reprinted
a
letter
sent
to
John
Brown
from
``
E.
B.
''
,
a
Quaker
lady
in
Newport
.
In
reference
to
Brown's
raid
she
wrote
,
``
though
we
are
non-resistants
and
religiously
believe
it
better
to
reform
by
moral
and
not
by
carnal
weapons
,
we
know
thee
was
anemated
by
the
most
generous
and
philanthropic
motives
''
.
``
E.
B.
''
compared
John
Brown
to
Moses
in
that
they
were
both
acting
to
deliver
millions
from
oppression
.
In
contrast
to
``
E.
B.
''
,
most
Rhode
Islanders
hardly
thought
of
John
Brown
as
being
another
Moses
.
Most
attempts
to
develop
any
sympathy
for
Brown
and
his
actions
found
an
unresponsive
audience
in
Rhode
Island
.
On
Wednesday
evening
,
November
23
,
1859
,
in
Warren
,
Rev.
Mark
Trafton
of
New
Bedford
,
gave
a
``
Mission
of
Sympathy
''
lecture
in
which
he
favorably
viewed
the
Harper's
Ferry
insurrection
.
The
Warren
Telegraph
stated
that
many
of
Rev.
Trafton's
remarks
were
inappropriate
and
savored
strongly
of
radicalism
and
fanaticism
.
In
its
account
of
the
Trafton
lecture
,
the
Providence
Daily
Post
said
that
the
remarks
of
Rev.
Trafton
made
the
people
indignant
.
No
sympathy
or
admiration
for
Brown
could
be
found
in
the
Providence
Daily
Post
,
for
the
editor
claimed
that
there
were
a
score
of
men
in
the
state
prison
who
were
a
thousand
times
more
deserving
of
sympathy
.
The
Providence
Daily
Journal
,
however
,
stated
that
Brown's
courage
,
bravery
,
and
heroism
``
in
a
good
cause
would
make
a
man
a
martyr
;
;
it
gives
something
of
dignity
even
to
a
bad
one
''
.
The
Woonsocket
Patriot
admitted
that
John
Brown
might
deserve
punishment
or
imprisonment
``
but
he
should
no
more
be
hung
than
Henry
A.
Wise
or
James
Buchanan
''
.
The
Newport
Mercury
exhibited
more
concern
over
the
possibility
of
the
abolitionists
making
a
martyr
of
Brown
than
it
did
over
the
development
of
sympathy
for
him
.
In
her
letter
to
John
Brown
,
``
E.
B.
''
,
the
Quakeress
from
Newport
,
had
suggested
that
the
American
people
owed
more
honor
to
John
Brown
for
seeking
to
free
the
slaves
than
they
did
to
George
Washington
.
During
the
latter
days
of
November
to
the
day
of
Brown's
execution
,
it
seems
that
most
Rhode
Islanders
did
not
concur
in
``
E.
B.'s
''
suggestion
.
On
November
22
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
Brown's
``
pluck
''
and
honest
fanaticism
must
be
admired
,
any
honor
paid
to
Brown
would
only
induce
other
fanatics
to
imitate
his
actions
.
A
week
later
the
Daily
Journal
had
discovered
the
initial
plans
of
some
Providence
citizens
to
hold
a
meeting
honoring
John
Brown
on
the
day
of
his
execution
.
The
editor
of
the
Daily
Journal
warned
,
``
that
if
such
a
demonstration
be
made
,
it
will
not
find
support
or
countenance
from
any
of
the
men
whose
names
are
recognized
as
having
a
right
to
speak
for
Providence
''
.
The
Providence
Daily
Post's
editor
wrote
that
he
could
not
believe
that
a
meeting
honoring
Brown
was
to
be
held
in
Providence
.
He
further
called
upon
the
people
of
Providence
to
rebuke
the
meeting
and
avoid
disgrace
.
On
December
2
,
1859
,
John
Brown
was
hanged
at
Charles
Town
,
Virginia
.
Extraordinary
precautions
were
taken
so
that
no
stranger
be
allowed
in
the
city
and
no
citizen
within
the
enclosure
surrounding
the
scaffold
.
In
many
Northern
towns
and
cities
meetings
were
held
and
church
bells
were
tolled
.
Such
was
not
the
case
in
Rhode
Island
.
The
only
public
demonstration
in
honor
of
John
Brown
was
held
at
Pratt's
Hall
in
Providence
,
on
the
day
of
his
execution
.
Despite
the
opposition
of
the
city
newspapers
,
the
Pratt
Hall
meeting
``
brought
together
a
very
respectable
audience
,
composed
in
part
of
those
who
had
been
distinguished
for
years
for
their
radical
views
upon
the
subject
of
slavery
,
of
many
of
our
colored
citizens
,
and
of
those
who
were
attracted
to
the
place
by
the
novelty
of
such
a
gathering
''
.
Seated
on
the
platform
were
Amos
C.
Barstow
,
ex-mayor
of
Providence
and
a
wealthy
Republican
stove
manufacturer
;
;
Thomas
Davis
,
an
uncompromising
Garrisonian
;
;
the
Reverend
Augustus
Woodbury
,
a
Unitarian
minister
;
;
the
Reverend
George
T.
Day
,
a
Free-Will
Baptist
;
;
Daniel
W.
Vaughan
,
and
William
H.
H.
Clements
.
The
latter
two
were
appointed
secretaries
.
The
first
speaker
was
Amos
C.
Barstow
who
had
been
unanimously
chosen
president
of
the
meeting
.
He
spoke
of
his
desire
to
promote
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
peaceable
means
and
he
compared
John
Brown
of
Harper's
Ferry
to
the
John
Brown
of
Rhode
Island's
colonial
period
.
Barstow
concluded
that
as
Rhode
Island's
John
Brown
became
a
canonized
hero
,
if
not
a
saint
,
so
would
it
be
with
John
Brown
of
Harper's
Ferry
.
The
next
speaker
was
George
T.
Day
.
Although
admitting
Brown's
guilt
on
legal
grounds
,
Day
said
that
,
``
Brown
is
no
common
criminal
;
;
his
deed
was
not
below
,
but
above
the
law
''
.
Following
Day
was
Woodbury
who
spoke
of
his
disapproval
of
Brown's
attempt
at
servile
insurrection
,
his
admiration
of
Brown's
character
,
and
his
opposition
to
slavery
.
Woodbury's
remarks
were
applauded
by
a
portion
of
the
audience
several
times
and
once
there
was
hissing
.
The
fourth
and
last
speaker
was
Thomas
Davis
.
By
this
time
large
numbers
of
the
audience
had
left
the
hall
.
Davis
commenced
his
remarks
by
an
allusion
to
the
general
feeling
of
opposition
which
the
meeting
had
encountered
from
many
of
the
citizens
and
all
the
newspapers
of
the
city
.
He
said
that
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
such
a
gathering
was
a
question
that
was
to
be
settled
by
every
man
in
accordance
with
the
convictions
of
private
judgments
.
In
the
remainder
of
his
speech
Davis
spoke
of
his
admiration
for
Brown
and
warned
those
who
took
part
in
the
meeting
that
they
``
are
liable
to
the
charge
that
they
are
supporting
traitors
and
upholding
men
whom
the
laws
have
condemned
''
.
He
recalled
that
in
Rhode
Island
a
party
opposed
to
the
state's
condemnation
of
a
man
(
Thomas
W.
Dorr
)
proclaimed
the
state's
action
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
principles
of
human
liberty
.
At
the
close
of
Davis'
speech
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
were
read
by
the
president
,
and
on
the
question
of
their
adoption
passed
unanimously
:
Whereas
,
John
Brown
has
cheerfully
risked
his
life
in
endeavoring
to
deliver
those
who
are
denied
all
rights
and
is
this
day
doomed
to
suffer
death
for
his
efforts
in
behalf
of
those
who
have
no
helper
:
Therefore
,
Resolved
that
,
while
we
most
decidedly
disapprove
the
methods
he
adopted
to
accomplish
his
objects
,
yet
in
his
willingness
to
die
in
aid
of
the
great
cause
of
human
freedom
,
we
still
recognize
the
qualities
of
a
noble
nature
and
the
exercise
of
a
spirit
which
true
men
have
always
admired
and
which
history
never
fails
to
honor
.
Resolved
that
his
wrongs
and
bereavements
in
Kansas
,
occasioned
by
the
violence
and
brutality
of
those
who
were
intent
on
the
propagation
of
slavery
in
that
territory
,
call
for
a
charitable
judgment
upon
his
recent
efforts
in
Virginia
to
undermine
the
despotism
from
which
he
had
suffered
,
and
commend
his
family
to
the
special
sympathy
and
aid
of
all
who
pity
suffering
and
reverence
justice
.
Resolved
that
the
anti-slavery
sentiment
is
becoming
ripe
for
resolute
action
.
Resolved
,
that
we
find
in
this
fearful
tragedy
at
Harper's
Ferry
a
reason
for
more
earnest
effort
to
remove
the
evil
of
slavery
from
the
whole
land
as
speedily
as
possible
.
On
the
morning
following
the
Pratt
Hall
meeting
the
editor
of
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
wrote
that
although
the
meeting
was
milder
and
less
extreme
than
those
held
in
other
areas
for
similar
purposes
,
it
could
have
been
avoided
completely
.
Rather
than
being
deceived
,
the
eye
is
puzzled
;
;
instead
of
seeing
objects
in
space
,
it
sees
nothing
more
than
--
a
picture
.
Through
1911
and
1912
,
as
the
Cubist
facet-plane's
tendency
to
adhere
to
the
literal
surface
became
harder
and
harder
to
deny
,
the
task
of
keeping
the
surface
at
arm's
length
fell
all
the
more
to
eye-undeceiving
contrivances
.
To
reinforce
,
and
sometimes
to
replace
,
the
simulated
typography
,
Braque
and
Picasso
began
to
mix
sand
and
other
foreign
substances
with
their
paint
;
;
the
granular
texture
thus
created
likewise
called
attention
to
the
reality
of
the
surface
and
was
effective
over
much
larger
areas
.
In
certain
other
pictures
,
however
,
Braque
began
to
paint
areas
in
exact
simulation
of
wood
graining
or
marbleizing
.
These
areas
,
by
virtue
of
their
abrupt
density
of
pattern
,
stated
the
literal
surface
with
such
new
and
superior
force
that
the
resulting
contrast
drove
the
simulated
printing
into
a
depth
from
which
it
could
be
rescued
--
and
set
to
shuttling
again
--
only
by
conventional
perspective
;
;
that
is
,
by
being
placed
in
such
relation
to
the
forms
depicted
within
the
illusion
that
these
forms
left
no
room
for
the
typography
except
near
the
surface
.
The
accumulation
of
such
devices
,
however
,
soon
had
the
effect
of
telescoping
,
even
while
separating
,
surface
and
depth
.
The
process
of
flattening
seemed
inexorable
,
and
it
became
necessary
to
emphasize
the
surface
still
further
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
fusing
with
the
illusion
.
It
was
for
this
reason
,
and
no
other
that
I
can
see
,
that
in
September
1912
,
Braque
took
the
radical
and
revolutionary
step
of
pasting
actual
pieces
of
imitation-woodgrain
wallpaper
to
a
drawing
on
paper
,
instead
of
trying
to
simulate
its
texture
in
paint
.
Picasso
says
that
he
himself
had
already
made
his
first
collage
toward
the
end
of
1911
,
when
he
glued
a
piece
of
imitation-caning
oilcloth
to
a
painting
on
canvas
.
It
is
true
that
his
first
collage
looks
more
Analytical
than
Braque's
,
which
would
confirm
the
date
he
assigns
it
.
But
it
is
also
true
that
Braque
was
the
consistent
pioneer
in
the
use
of
simulated
textures
as
well
as
of
typography
;
;
and
moreover
,
he
had
already
begun
to
broaden
and
simplify
the
facet-planes
of
Analytical
Cubism
as
far
back
as
the
end
of
1910
.
When
we
examine
what
each
master
says
was
his
first
collage
we
see
that
much
the
same
thing
happens
in
each
.
(
It
makes
no
real
difference
that
Braque's
collage
is
on
paper
and
eked
out
in
charcoal
,
while
Picasso's
is
on
canvas
and
eked
out
in
oil
.

By
its
greater
corporeal
presence
and
its
greater
extraneousness
,
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
serves
for
a
seeming
moment
to
push
everything
else
into
a
more
vivid
idea
of
depth
than
the
simulated
printing
or
simulated
textures
had
ever
done
.
But
here
again
,
the
surface-declaring
device
both
overshoots
and
falls
short
of
its
aim
.
For
the
illusion
of
depth
created
by
the
contrast
between
the
affixed
material
and
everything
else
gives
way
immediately
to
an
illusion
of
forms
in
bas-relief
,
which
gives
way
in
turn
,
and
with
equal
immediacy
,
to
an
illusion
that
seems
to
contain
both
--
or
neither
.
Because
of
the
size
of
the
areas
it
covers
,
the
pasted
paper
establishes
undepicted
flatness
bodily
,
as
more
than
an
indication
or
sign
.
Literal
flatness
now
tends
to
assert
itself
as
the
main
event
of
the
picture
,
and
the
device
boomerangs
:
the
illusion
of
depth
is
rendered
even
more
precarious
than
before
.
Instead
of
isolating
the
literal
flatness
by
specifying
and
circumscribing
it
,
the
pasted
paper
or
cloth
releases
and
spreads
it
,
and
the
artist
seems
to
have
nothing
left
but
this
undepicted
flatness
with
which
to
finish
as
well
as
start
his
picture
.
The
actual
surface
becomes
both
ground
and
background
,
and
it
turns
out
--
suddenly
and
paradoxically
--
that
the
only
place
left
for
a
three-dimensional
illusion
is
in
front
of
,
upon
,
the
surface
.
In
their
very
first
collages
,
Braque
and
Picasso
draw
or
paint
over
and
on
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
,
so
that
certain
of
the
principal
features
of
their
subjects
as
depicted
seem
to
thrust
out
into
real
,
bas-relief
space
--
or
to
be
about
to
do
so
--
while
the
rest
of
the
subject
remains
imbedded
in
,
or
flat
upon
,
the
surface
.
And
the
surface
is
driven
back
,
in
its
very
surfaceness
,
only
by
this
contrast
.
In
the
upper
center
of
Braque's
first
collage
,
Fruit
Dish
(
in
Douglas
Cooper's
collection
)
,
a
bunch
of
grapes
is
rendered
with
such
conventionally
vivid
sculptural
effect
as
to
lift
it
practically
off
the
picture
plane
.
The
trompe-l'oeil
illusion
here
is
no
longer
enclosed
between
parallel
flatnesses
,
but
seems
to
thrust
through
the
surface
of
the
drawing
paper
and
establish
depth
on
top
of
it
.
Yet
the
violent
immediacy
of
the
wallpaper
strips
pasted
to
the
paper
,
and
the
only
lesser
immediacy
of
block
capitals
that
simulate
window
lettering
,
manage
somehow
to
push
the
grape
cluster
back
into
place
on
the
picture
plane
so
that
it
does
not
``
jump
''
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
wallpaper
strips
themselves
seem
to
be
pushed
into
depth
by
the
lines
and
patches
of
shading
charcoaled
upon
them
,
and
by
their
placing
in
relation
to
the
block
capitals
;
;
and
these
capitals
seem
in
turn
to
be
pushed
back
by
their
placing
,
and
by
contrast
with
the
corporeality
of
the
woodgraining
.
Thus
every
part
and
plane
of
the
picture
keeps
changing
place
in
relative
depth
with
every
other
part
and
plane
;
;
and
it
is
as
if
the
only
stable
relation
left
among
the
different
parts
of
the
picture
is
the
ambivalent
and
ambiguous
one
that
each
has
with
the
surface
.
And
the
same
thing
,
more
or
less
,
can
be
said
of
the
contents
of
Picasso's
first
collage
.
In
later
collages
of
both
masters
,
a
variety
of
extraneous
materials
are
used
,
sometimes
in
the
same
work
,
and
almost
always
in
conjunction
with
every
other
eye-deceiving
and
eye-undeceiving
device
they
can
think
of
.
The
area
adjacent
to
one
edge
of
a
piece
of
affixed
material
--
or
simply
of
a
painted-in
form
--
will
be
shaded
to
pry
that
edge
away
from
the
surface
,
while
something
will
be
drawn
,
painted
or
even
pasted
over
another
part
of
the
same
shape
to
drive
it
back
into
depth
.
Planes
defined
as
parallel
to
the
surface
also
cut
through
it
into
real
space
,
and
a
depth
is
suggested
optically
which
is
greater
than
that
established
pictorially
.
All
this
expands
the
oscillation
between
surface
and
depth
so
as
to
encompass
fictive
space
in
front
of
the
surface
as
well
as
behind
it
.
Flatness
may
now
monopolize
everything
,
but
it
is
a
flatness
become
so
ambiguous
and
expanded
as
to
turn
into
illusion
itself
--
at
least
an
optical
if
not
,
properly
speaking
,
a
pictorial
illusion
.
Depicted
,
Cubist
flatness
is
now
almost
completely
assimilated
to
the
literal
,
undepicted
kind
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
reacts
upon
and
largely
transforms
the
undepicted
kind
--
and
it
does
so
,
moreover
,
without
depriving
the
latter
of
its
literalness
;
;
rather
,
it
underpins
and
reinforces
that
literalness
,
re-creates
it
.
Out
of
this
re-created
literalness
,
the
Cubist
subject
reemerged
.
For
it
had
turned
out
,
by
a
further
paradox
of
Cubism
,
that
the
means
to
an
illusion
of
depth
and
plasticity
had
now
become
widely
divergent
from
the
means
of
representation
or
imaging
.
In
the
Analytical
phase
of
their
Cubism
,
Braque
and
Picasso
had
not
only
had
to
minimize
three-dimensionality
simply
in
order
to
preserve
it
;
;
they
had
also
had
to
generalize
it
--
to
the
point
,
finally
,
where
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
became
abstracted
from
specific
three-dimensional
entities
and
was
rendered
largely
as
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
as
such
:
as
a
disembodied
attribute
and
expropriated
property
detached
from
everything
not
itself
.
In
order
to
be
saved
,
plasticity
had
had
to
be
isolated
;
;
and
as
the
aspect
of
the
subject
was
transposed
into
those
clusters
of
more
or
less
interchangeable
and
contour-obliterating
facet-planes
by
which
plasticity
was
isolated
under
the
Cubist
method
,
the
subject
itself
became
largely
unrecognizable
.
Cubism
,
in
its
1911-1912
phase
(
which
the
French
,
with
justice
,
call
``
hermetic
''
)
was
on
the
verge
of
abstract
art
.
It
was
then
that
Picasso
and
Braque
were
confronted
with
a
unique
dilemma
:
they
had
to
choose
between
illusion
and
representation
.
If
they
opted
for
illusion
,
it
could
only
be
illusion
per
se
--
an
illusion
of
depth
,
and
of
relief
,
so
general
and
abstracted
as
to
exclude
the
representation
of
individual
objects
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
opted
for
representation
,
it
had
to
be
representation
per
se
--
representation
as
image
pure
and
simple
,
without
connotations
(
at
least
,
without
more
than
schematic
ones
)
of
the
three-dimensional
space
in
which
the
objects
represented
originally
existed
.
It
was
the
collage
that
made
the
terms
of
this
dilemma
clear
:
the
representational
could
be
restored
and
preserved
only
on
the
flat
and
literal
surface
now
that
illusion
and
representation
had
become
,
for
the
first
time
,
mutually
exclusive
alternatives
.
In
the
end
,
Picasso
and
Braque
plumped
for
the
representational
,
and
it
would
seem
they
did
so
deliberately
.
(
This
provides
whatever
real
justification
there
is
for
the
talk
about
``
reality
''
.
)
But
the
inner
,
formal
logic
of
Cubism
,
as
it
worked
itself
out
through
the
collage
,
had
just
as
much
to
do
with
shaping
their
decision
.
When
the
smaller
facet-planes
of
Analytical
Cubism
were
placed
upon
or
juxtaposed
with
the
large
,
dense
shapes
formed
by
the
affixed
materials
of
the
collage
,
they
had
to
coalesce
--
become
``
synthesized
''
--
into
larger
planar
shapes
themselves
simply
in
order
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
picture
plane
.
Left
in
their
previous
atom-like
smallness
,
they
would
have
cut
away
too
abruptly
into
depth
;
;
and
the
broad
,
opaque
shapes
of
pasted
paper
would
have
been
isolated
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
jump
out
of
plane
.
Large
planes
juxtaposed
with
other
large
planes
tend
to
assert
themselves
as
independent
shapes
,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
flat
,
they
also
assert
themselves
as
silhouettes
;
;
and
independent
silhouettes
are
apt
to
coincide
with
the
recognizable
contours
of
the
subject
from
which
a
picture
starts
(
if
it
does
start
from
a
subject
)
.
It
was
because
of
this
chain-reaction
as
much
as
for
any
other
reason
--
that
is
,
because
of
the
growing
independence
of
the
planar
unit
in
collage
as
a
shape
--
that
the
identity
of
depicted
objects
,
or
at
least
parts
of
them
,
re-emerged
in
Braque's
and
Picasso's
papiers
colles
and
continued
to
remain
more
conspicuous
there
--
but
only
as
flattened
silhouettes
--
than
in
any
of
their
paintings
done
wholly
in
oil
before
the
end
of
1913
.
Analytical
Cubism
came
to
an
end
in
the
collage
,
but
not
conclusively
;
;
nor
did
Synthetic
Cubism
fully
begin
there
.
Only
when
the
collage
had
been
exhaustively
translated
into
oil
,
and
transformed
by
this
translation
,
did
Cubism
become
an
affair
of
positive
color
and
flat
,
interlocking
silhouettes
whose
legibility
and
placement
created
allusions
to
,
if
not
the
illusion
of
,
unmistakable
three-dimensional
identities
.
Synthetic
Cubism
began
with
Picasso
alone
,
late
in
1913
or
early
in
1914
;
;
this
was
the
point
at
which
he
finally
took
the
lead
in
Cubist
innovation
away
from
Braque
,
never
again
to
relinquish
it
.
But
even
before
that
,
Picasso
had
glimpsed
and
entered
,
for
a
moment
,
a
certain
revolutionary
path
in
which
no
one
had
preceded
him
.
It
was
as
though
,
in
that
instant
,
he
had
felt
the
flatness
of
collage
as
too
constricting
and
had
suddenly
tried
to
escape
all
the
way
back
--
or
forward
--
to
literal
three-dimensionality
.
This
he
did
by
using
utterly
literal
means
to
carry
the
forward
push
of
the
collage
(
and
of
Cubism
in
general
)
literally
into
the
literal
space
in
front
of
the
picture
plane
.
Some
time
in
1912
,
Picasso
cut
out
and
folded
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
shape
of
a
guitar
;
;
to
this
he
glued
and
fitted
other
pieces
of
paper
and
four
taut
strings
,
thus
creating
a
sequence
of
flat
surfaces
in
real
and
sculptural
space
to
which
there
clung
only
the
vestige
of
a
picture
plane
.
The
affixed
elements
of
collage
were
extruded
,
as
it
were
,
and
cut
off
from
the
literal
pictorial
surface
to
form
a
bas-relief
.
Los
Angeles
in
1957
finally
bowed
to
the
skyscraper
.
)
And
without
high
density
in
the
core
,
rapid-transit
systems
cannot
be
maintained
economically
,
let
alone
built
from
scratch
at
today's
prices
.
However
,
the
building
of
freeways
and
garages
cannot
continue
forever
.
The
new
interchange
among
the
four
Los
Angeles
freeways
,
including
the
grade-constructed
accesses
,
occupies
by
itself
no
less
than
eighty
acres
of
downtown
land
,
one-eighth
of
a
square
mile
,
an
area
about
the
size
of
Rockefeller
Center
in
New
York
.
It
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
mass
of
intertwined
concrete
constitutes
what
the
law
calls
``
the
highest
and
best
use
''
of
centrally
located
urban
land
.
As
it
affects
the
city's
fiscal
situation
,
such
an
interchange
is
ruinous
;
;
it
removes
forever
from
the
tax
rolls
property
which
should
be
taxed
to
pay
for
the
city
services
.
Subways
improved
land
values
without
taking
away
land
;
;
freeways
boost
valuation
less
(
because
the
garages
they
require
are
not
prime
buildings
by
a
long
shot
)
,
and
reduce
the
acreage
that
can
be
taxed
.
Downtown
Los
Angeles
is
already
two-thirds
freeway
,
interchange
,
street
,
parking
lot
and
garage
--
one
of
those
preposterous
``
if
''
statistics
has
already
come
to
pass
.
The
freeway
with
narrowly
spaced
interchanges
concentrates
and
mitigates
the
access
problem
,
but
it
also
acts
inevitably
as
an
artificial
,
isolating
boundary
.
City
planners
do
not
always
use
this
boundary
as
effectively
as
they
might
.
Less
ambitious
freeway
plans
may
be
more
successful
--
especially
when
the
roadways
and
interchanges
are
raised
,
allowing
for
cross
access
at
many
points
and
providing
parking
areas
below
the
ramp
.
Meanwhile
,
the
automobile
and
its
friend
the
truck
have
cost
the
central
city
some
of
its
industrial
dominance
.
In
ever
greater
numbers
,
factories
are
locating
in
the
suburbs
or
in
``
industrial
parks
''
removed
from
the
city's
political
jurisdiction
.
The
appeal
of
the
suburb
is
particularly
strong
for
heavy
industry
,
which
must
move
bulky
objects
along
a
lengthy
assembly
line
and
wants
enough
land
area
to
do
the
entire
job
on
one
floor
.
To
light
industry
,
the
economies
of
being
on
one
floor
are
much
slighter
,
but
efficiency
engineers
usually
believe
in
them
,
and
manufacturers
looking
for
ways
to
cut
costs
cannot
be
prevented
from
turning
to
efficiency
engineers
.
This
movement
of
industry
away
from
the
central
cities
is
not
so
catastrophically
new
as
some
prophets
seem
to
believe
.
It
is
merely
the
latest
example
of
the
leapfrog
growth
which
formed
the
pattern
of
virtually
all
American
cities
.
The
big
factories
which
are
relatively
near
the
centers
of
our
cities
--
the
rubber
factories
in
Akron
,
Chrysler's
Detroit
plants
,
U.S.
Steel's
Pittsburgh
works
--
often
began
on
these
sites
at
a
time
when
that
was
the
edge
of
the
city
,
yet
close
to
transport
(
river
)
,
storage
(
piers
)
and
power
(
river
)
.
The
``
leapfrog
''
was
a
phenomenon
of
the
railroad
and
the
steam
turbine
,
and
the
time
when
the
belts
of
residence
surrounding
the
old
factory
area
were
not
yet
blighted
.
The
truck
and
the
car
gave
the
manufacturer
a
new
degree
of
freedom
in
selecting
his
plant
site
.
Until
internal
combustion
became
cheap
,
he
had
to
be
near
a
railroad
siding
and
a
trolley
line
or
an
existing
large
community
of
lower-class
homes
.
The
railroad
siding
is
still
important
--
it
is
usually
,
though
not
always
,
true
that
long-haul
shipment
by
rail
is
cheaper
than
trucking
.
But
anybody
who
promises
a
substantial
volume
of
business
can
get
a
railroad
to
run
a
short
spur
to
his
plant
these
days
,
and
many
businesses
can
live
without
the
railroad
.
And
there
are
now
many
millions
of
workers
for
whom
the
factory
with
the
big
parking
lot
,
which
can
be
reached
by
driving
across
or
against
the
usual
pattern
of
rush
hour
traffic
and
grille-route
bus
lines
,
is
actually
more
convenient
than
the
walk-to
factory
.
Willow
Run
,
General
Electric's
enormous
installations
at
Louisville
and
Syracuse
,
the
Pentagon
,
Boeing
in
Seattle
,
Douglas
and
Lockheed
in
Los
Angeles
,
the
new
automobile
assembly
plants
everywhere
--
none
of
these
is
substantially
served
by
any
sort
of
conventional
mass
rapid
transit
.
They
are
all
suburban
plants
,
relying
on
the
roads
to
keep
them
supplied
with
workers
.
And
wherever
the
new
thruways
go
up
their
banks
are
lined
by
neat
glass
and
metal
and
colored
brick
light
industry
.
The
drive
along
Massachusetts'
Route
128
,
the
by-pass
which
makes
an
arc
about
twenty
miles
from
downtown
Boston
,
may
be
a
vision
of
the
future
.
The
future
could
be
worse
.
The
plants
along
Route
128
are
mostly
well
designed
and
nicely
set
against
the
New
England
rocks
and
trees
.
They
can
even
be
rather
grand
,
like
Edward
Land's
monument
to
the
astonishing
success
of
Polaroid
.
But
they
deny
the
values
of
the
city
--
the
crowded
,
competitive
,
tolerant
city
,
the
``
melting
pot
''
which
gave
off
so
many
of
the
most
admirable
American
qualities
.
They
are
segregated
businesses
,
combining
again
on
one
site
the
factory
and
the
office
,
drawing
their
work
force
from
segregated
communities
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
how
many
of
the
plants
on
Massachusetts'
Route
128
draw
most
of
their
income
either
from
the
government
in
non-competitive
cost-plus
arrangements
,
or
from
the
exploitation
of
patents
which
grant
at
least
a
partial
monopoly
.
While
the
factories
were
always
the
center
of
the
labor
market
,
they
were
often
on
the
city's
periphery
.
In
spreading
the
factories
even
farther
,
the
automobile
may
not
have
changed
to
any
great
extent
the
growth
pattern
of
the
cities
.
Even
the
loss
of
hotel
business
to
the
outskirt's
motel
has
been
relatively
painless
;
;
the
hotel-motel
demarcation
is
becoming
harder
to
find
every
year
.
What
hurts
most
is
the
damage
the
automobile
has
done
to
central-city
retailing
,
especially
in
those
cities
where
public
transit
is
feeble
.
Some
retailing
,
of
course
,
always
spreads
with
the
population
--
grocery
stores
,
drugstores
,
local
haberdasheries
and
dress
shops
,
candy
stores
and
the
like
.
But
whenever
a
major
purchase
was
contemplated
forty
years
ago
--
a
new
bedroom
set
or
a
winter
coat
,
an
Easter
bonnet
,
a
bicycle
for
Junior
--
the
family
set
off
for
the
downtown
department
store
,
where
the
selection
would
be
greatest
.
Department
stores
congregated
in
the
``
one
hundred
per
cent
location
''
,
where
all
the
transit
lines
converged
.
These
stores
are
still
there
,
but
the
volume
of
the
``
downtown
store
''
has
been
on
a
relative
decline
,
while
in
many
cities
the
suburban
``
branch
''
sells
more
and
more
dry
goods
.
If
the
retailer
and
hotelman's
downtown
unit
sales
have
been
decreasing
,
however
,
his
dollar
volume
continues
to
rise
,
and
it
is
dollars
which
you
put
in
the
bank
.
In
most
discussions
of
this
phenomenon
,
the
figures
are
substantially
inflated
.
No
suburban
shopping-center
branch
--
not
even
Hudson's
vast
Northland
outside
Detroit
--
does
anything
like
the
unit
volume
of
business
or
carries
anything
like
the
variety
of
merchandise
to
be
found
in
the
home
store
.
Telephone
orders
distort
the
picture
:
the
suburbanite
naturally
calls
a
local
rather
than
a
central-city
number
if
both
are
listed
in
an
advertisement
,
especially
if
the
local
call
eliminates
city
sales
tax
.
The
suburban
branch
is
thereby
credited
with
a
sale
which
would
have
been
made
even
if
its
glass
doors
had
never
opened
.
Accounting
procedures
which
continue
to
charge
a
disproportionate
overhead
and
warehouse
expense
to
the
main
store
make
the
branches
seem
more
profitable
than
they
are
.
In
many
cases
that
statement
--
``
We
break
even
on
our
downtown
operation
and
make
money
on
our
branches
''
--
would
be
turned
around
if
the
cost
analysis
were
recalculated
on
terms
less
prejudicial
to
the
old
store
.
Fear
of
the
competition
--
always
a
great
motivating
force
in
the
American
economy
--
makes
retailers
who
do
not
have
suburban
operations
exaggerate
both
the
volume
and
the
profitability
of
their
rival's
shiny
new
branches
.
The
fact
seems
to
be
that
very
many
large
branch
stores
are
uneconomical
,
that
the
choice
of
location
in
the
suburbs
is
as
important
as
it
was
downtown
,
and
that
even
highly
suburbanized
cities
will
support
only
so
many
big
branches
.
Moreover
,
the
cost
of
operations
is
always
high
in
any
new
store
,
as
the
conservative
bankers
who
act
as
controllers
for
retail
giants
are
beginning
to
discover
.
When
all
has
been
said
,
however
,
the
big
branch
store
remains
a
major
break
with
history
in
the
development
of
American
retailing
.
Just
as
the
suburban
factory
may
be
more
convenient
than
the
downtown
plant
to
the
worker
with
a
car
,
the
trip
to
the
shopping
center
may
seem
far
easier
than
to
the
downtown
department
store
,
though
both
are
the
same
distance
from
home
.
Indeed
,
there
are
some
cities
where
the
suburban
shopping
pulls
customers
who
are
geographically
much
nearer
to
downtown
.
Raymond
Vernon
reports
that
residents
of
East
St.
Louis
have
been
driving
across
the
Mississippi
,
through
the
heart
of
downtown
St.
Louis
and
out
to
the
western
suburbs
for
major
shopping
,
simply
because
parking
is
easier
at
the
big
branches
than
it
is
in
the
heart
of
town
.
To
the
extent
that
the
problem
is
merely
parking
,
an
aggressive
downtown
management
,
like
that
of
Lazarus
Brothers
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
can
fight
back
successfully
by
building
a
garage
on
the
lot
next
door
.
If
the
distant
patron
of
the
suburban
branch
has
been
frightened
away
from
downtown
by
traffic
problems
,
however
,
the
city
store
can
only
pressure
the
politicians
to
do
something
about
the
highways
or
await
the
completion
of
the
federal
highway
program
.
And
if
the
affection
for
the
suburban
branch
reflects
a
desire
to
shop
with
``
nice
people
''
,
rather
than
with
the
indiscriminate
urban
mass
which
supports
the
downtown
department
store
,
the
central
location
may
be
in
serious
trouble
.
Today
,
according
to
land
economist
Homer
Hoyt
,
shopping
centers
and
their
associated
parking
lots
cover
some
46,000
acres
of
land
,
which
is
almost
exactly
the
total
land
area
in
all
the
nation's
Central
Business
Districts
put
together
.
The
downtown
store
continues
to
offer
the
great
inducement
of
variety
,
both
within
its
gates
and
across
the
street
,
where
other
department
stores
are
immediately
convenient
for
the
shopper
who
wants
to
see
what
is
available
before
making
up
her
mind
.
If
anything
may
be
predicted
in
the
quicksilver
world
of
retailing
,
it
seems
likely
that
the
suburban
branch
will
come
to
dominate
children's
clothing
(
taking
the
kid
downtown
is
too
much
of
a
production
)
,
household
gadgetry
and
the
discount
business
in
big-ticket
items
.
Department
stores
were
built
on
dry
goods
,
especially
ladies'
fashions
,
and
in
this
area
,
in
the
long
run
,
the
suburban
branches
will
be
hard
put
to
compete
against
downtown
.
If
this
analysis
is
correct
,
the
suburban
branches
will
turn
out
to
be
what
management's
cost
accountants
refuse
to
acknowledge
,
marginal
operations
rather
than
major
factors
.
Historically
in
America
the
appeal
of
cities
has
been
their
color
and
life
,
the
variety
of
experience
they
offered
.
``
How
ya
gonna
keep
'em
down
on
the
farm
''
?
?
Was
a
question
that
had
to
be
asked
long
before
they
saw
Paree
.
Though
Americans
usually
lived
in
groups
segregated
by
national
origin
or
religious
belief
,
they
liked
to
work
and
shop
in
the
noise
and
vitality
of
downtown
.
Only
a
radical
change
in
the
nature
of
the
population
in
the
central
city
would
be
likely
to
destroy
this
preference
--
and
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
question
of
whether
such
a
change
,
gloomily
foreseen
by
so
many
urban
diagnosticians
,
is
actually
upon
us
.

Suburbs
and
Negroes
In
their
book
,
American
Skyline
,
Christopher
Tunnard
and
Henry
Hope
Reed
argue
that
Franklin
Roosevelt's
New
Deal
was
what
made
the
modern
suburb
a
possibility
--
a
fine
ironical
argument
,
when
you
consider
how
suburbanites
tend
to
vote
.
The
first
superhighways
--
New
York's
Henry
Hudson
and
Chicago's
Lake
Shore
,
San
Francisco's
Bay
Bridge
and
its
approaches
,
a
good
slice
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
--
were
built
as
part
of
the
federal
works
program
which
was
going
to
cure
the
depression
.
At
the
same
time
,
Roosevelt's
Federal
Housing
Administration
,
coupled
with
Henry
Morgenthau's
cheap-money
policy
,
permitted
ordinary
lower-middle-class
families
to
build
their
own
homes
.
Bankers
who
had
been
reluctant
to
lend
without
better
security
than
the
house
itself
got
that
security
from
the
U.
S.
government
;
;
householders
who
had
been
unable
to
pick
up
the
burden
of
short-term
high-interest
mortgages
found
they
could
borrow
for
twenty-five
years
at
4
per
cent
,
under
government
aegis
.
Before
losing
itself
in
the
sands
of
the
19th
Century
,
the
grand
stream
of
Italian
Renaissance
architectural
decoration
made
a
last
appearance
in
the
Brumidi
frescos
of
the
Capitol
Rotunda
in
Washington
.
The
artistic
generation
after
Brumidi
was
trained
in
the
Paris
of
that
time
to
a
more
meticulous
standard
of
execution
,
and
tended
to
overlook
greatness
of
conception
where
faults
and
weakness
were
easy
to
find
.
But
it
is
a
great
conception
.
The
open
ceiling
,
with
allegorical
and
classical
figures
thrown
in
masses
against
the
sky
:
the
closed
frieze
,
formally
divided
into
historical
scenes
and
tightly
tied
to
the
stone
walls
,
belong
in
their
large
ordering
to
the
line
of
Correggio
and
his
Baroque
followers
.
The
descent
may
be
remote
,
but
this
is
surely
the
only
full-scale
example
of
that
vigorous
inheritance
in
the
United
States
.
Constantino
Brumidi
designed
the
decorative
scheme
as
a
whole
,
in
collaboration
with
the
architect
Charles
U.
Walter
,
at
the
time
when
plans
were
being
made
to
replace
the
wooden
dome
of
Bullfinch
with
the
present
much
larger
iron
structure
.
After
many
years
and
many
interruptions
he
was
able
to
finish
the
canopy
fresco
,
and
slightly
less
than
half
the
frieze
,
beginning
with
the
Liberty
group
opposite
the
East
door
,
and
ending
with
William
Penn
,
all
but
one
leg
,
when
a
tragic
accident
ended
his
career
.
He
left
at
his
death
sketches
,
drawn
to
scale
,
for
the
rest
of
the
circle
.
These
were
carried
out
not
too
faithfully
by
Filippo
Costaggini
,
who
began
by
supplying
the
missing
member
to
the
founder
of
Pennsylvania
and
noting
in
pencil
,
in
Italian
,
that
he
``
began
at
this
point
''
.
When
Costaggini
had
used
up
all
the
sketches
thirty-six
feet
of
empty
frieze
were
left
over
.
A
blank
undecorated
void
,
plastered
in
roughcast
,
disfigured
the
wall
of
the
Rotunda
until
1951
.
Then
,
advised
by
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
,
the
Joint
Committee
for
the
Library
,
traditionally
responsible
for
the
works
of
art
in
the
building
,
ordered
the
space
cleared
and
painted
in
fresco
,
to
show
``
the
Peace
after
the
Civil
War
''
,
``
the
Spanish-American
War
''
,
and
``
the
Birth
of
Aviation
''
,
to
match
as
nearly
as
feasible
Brumidi's
technique
and
composition
.
Later
the
cleaning
and
restoration
were
ordered
,
first
of
the
older
part
of
the
frieze
,
finally
of
the
canopy
.
What
follows
is
therefore
a
description
of
three
separate
undertakings
,
the
new
frescoing
of
the
gap
,
and
the
successive
essays
in
conservation
,
with
some
discussion
of
problems
that
arose
in
connection
with
each
.
For
the
use
of
students
and
future
restorers
,
a
full
,
day-by-day
record
was
kept
of
all
three
undertakings
,
complete
technical
reports
on
what
we
found
and
what
we
did
.
These
may
be
consulted
in
the
office
of
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
,
or
the
Library
of
Congress
.
The
first
preliminary
was
inspecting
the
unfinished
length
of
frieze
,
a
jumble
of
roughcast
and
finish
coats
,
all
in
bad
condition
.
It
was
decided
to
strip
the
whole
area
down
to
the
bricks
,
and
to
replace
the
rough
coats
up
to
one
inch
thickness
to
agree
with
the
older
artists'
preparation
,
with
a
mortar
,
one
part
slaked
lime
,
three
parts
sand
,
to
be
put
on
in
two
layers
.
Cartoons
were
drawn
full
size
,
after
sketches
had
been
made
to
satisfy
all
the
authorities
.
There
was
some
difficulty
here
.
One
had
to
manage
the
given
subjects
,
three
diverse
recent
events
,
so
as
to
make
them
part
of
a
classical
frieze
,
--
that
is
,
a
pattern
of
large
figures
filling
the
space
,
with
not
much
else
,
against
a
blank
background
.
Moreover
,
all
three
representations
must
be
squeezed
comfortably
into
little
more
than
the
length
Brumidi
allowed
for
each
one
of
his
.
When
it
was
all
arranged
to
fit
,
and
not
to
interrupt
the
lengthwise
flow
of
movement
in
the
frieze
,
the
cartoons
were
tried
in
place
.
The
scaffolding
,
a
confusion
of
heavy
beams
hanging
from
the
gallery
above
,
was
strong
and
safe
,
but
obscured
visibility
.
Nothing
could
be
seen
from
the
floor
,
but
by
moving
around
the
gallery
one
could
get
glimpses
;
;
and
we
were
able
to
decide
on
some
amplification
of
scale
.
To
be
sure
of
matching
color
as
well
as
form
,
pieces
of
cartoon
were
traced
on
the
roughcast
,
and
large
samples
painted
in
fresco
,
then
left
two
months
to
dry
out
to
their
final
key
.
Later
it
was
gratifying
to
note
that
they
had
set
so
solidly
as
to
be
hard
to
remove
when
the
time
came
.
The
scaffold
was
the
length
of
the
space
to
be
painted
.
What
bits
of
Brumidi
and
Costaggini
could
be
reached
at
either
end
seemed
in
good
order
,
though
the
roughish
sandy
surface
was
thick
with
dust
.
Washed
,
they
came
out
surprisingly
clear
and
bright
.
It
could
be
seen
that
both
artists
used
a
very
thick
final
coat
of
plaster
,
one
half
inch
,
and
that
both
followed
the
traditional
Italian
fresco
technique
as
described
by
Cennino
Cennini
in
the
14th
Century
,
and
current
in
Italy
to
this
day
.
That
is
,
they
used
opaque
color
throughout
,
getting
solid
highlights
with
active
lime
white
.
Painting
``
a
secco
''
is
much
in
evidence
.
A
brown
hatching
reinforces
and
broadens
shadows
,
and
much
of
the
background
is
solidly
covered
with
a
dark
coat
.
This
brown
is
sometimes
so
rich
in
medium
as
to
appear
to
be
oil
paint
.
In
our
own
practice
,
to
have
the
last
``
intonaco
''
plaster
coat
thick
enough
to
match
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
fine
cracks
in
drying
,
we
found
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
in
two
layers
,
letting
the
first
set
awhile
before
applying
the
second
.
The
mortar
was
three
parts
sand
to
two
of
lime
.
Some
of
the
lime
that
is
always
on
hand
in
the
Capitol
basement
for
plaster
repairs
was
slaked
several
months
for
us
;
;
but
to
make
it
stiffer
,
of
a
really
putty-like
consistency
to
avoid
cracking
,
we
added
a
little
hydrated
lime
--
hard
on
the
hands
,
but
we
could
see
no
other
disadvantage
.
I
am
told
that
a
mortar
longer
slaked
might
have
remained
longer
in
condition
for
painting
.
As
it
was
,
it
took
the
pigment
well
for
six
hours
,
enough
for
our
purpose
,
and
held
it
firmly
in
setting
.
It
was
obvious
that
to
match
Brumidi
,
white
must
be
mixed
with
all
but
the
darkest
tones
.
Lime
white
,
hard
and
brilliant
,
has
a
tendency
to
``
jump
''
away
from
the
other
colors
in
drying
,
and
also
by
its
capacity
to
set
,
to
preclude
the
use
of
ready-made
gradations
,
so
useful
in
decorative
work
.
In
older
Italian
practice
,
lime
,
dried
and
reground
``
bianco
sangiovanni
''
,
entered
into
such
prepared
shades
.
For
convenience
we
chose
a
stronger
pigment
,
unknown
to
the
early
Italians
or
to
Brumidi
,
titanium
oxide
,
reserving
the
active
lime
white
for
highest
lights
,
put
on
at
the
end
of
the
day's
stint
.
Other
pigments
were
mostly
raw
umber
,
some
burnt
umber
,
and
a
little
yellow
ochre
.
This
last
was
probably
not
in
Brumidi's
palette
,
but
was
needed
to
take
the
chill
,
bluish
look
off
the
new
work
next
to
the
old
,
where
softening
effects
of
time
were
seen
,
even
after
thorough
cleaning
.
The
use
of
``
secco
''
we
tried
to
restrict
to
covering
joints
.
Experience
showed
,
however
,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
paint
a
dark
umber
background
in
fresco
that
will
not
dry
out
spotty
and
uneven
.
Later
Brumidi
and
Costaggini
will
be
seen
coping
with
this
same
problem
.
We
were
forced
,
as
they
were
,
to
work
a
good
deal
of
tempera
into
background
and
dark
areas
.
We
made
it
by
Doerner's
recipe
,
five
parts
thoroughly
washed
cheese
curd
to
one
of
lime
putty
;
;
ground
together
they
made
a
strong
adhesive
,
which
became
waterproof
in
drying
.
Figure
1
was
taken
in
1953
.
The
new
part
is
finished
.
On
the
right
is
the
Brumidi
Liberty
group
,
as
it
looked
after
cleaning
operations
,
which
had
not
yet
come
around
to
the
other
end
;
;
where
,
of
Costaggini
,
only
some
foliage
has
been
washed
,
at
the
point
where
his
work
stopped
.
One
is
led
to
speculate
as
to
why
the
empty
space
was
there
,
left
for
our
century
to
finish
.
Costaggini
said
it
was
Brumidi's
fault
in
not
providing
enough
material
to
fill
the
circle
.
Brumidi's
son
later
maintained
that
Costaggini
had
compressed
and
mutilated
his
father's
designs
,
ambitiously
coveting
a
bit
he
could
claim
for
his
very
own
.
This
question
might
be
settled
by
comparing
the
measurement
of
the
actual
circumference
with
the
dimensions
noted
,
presumably
in
Brumidi's
hand
,
above
the
various
sections
of
his
long
preparatory
drawing
,
which
has
been
kept
.
Whosever
fault
,
it
is
evident
that
Brumidi
intended
to
fill
out
the
whole
frieze
with
his
``
histories
''
and
come
full
circle
with
the
scene
of
the
discovery
of
California
gold
.
In
painting
a
fresco
,
the
handling
of
wet
mortar
compels
one
always
to
move
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
left
to
right
,
not
to
spoil
yesterday's
work
with
today's
plastering
.
At
the
very
first
,
then
,
Brumidi
was
required
,
by
the
classically
pyramidal
shape
of
his
central
group
,
to
fill
in
the
triangular
space
above
the
seated
girl
on
Liberty's
right
,
before
starting
on
the
allegorical
figures
themselves
.
Here
he
put
a
small
man
,
whose
missing
hands
might
have
left
his
function
doubtful
,
until
comparison
with
the
first
sketches
showed
that
when
the
artist
came
back
to
the
beginning
,
this
was
to
be
the
closing
figure
of
the
party
of
``
forty-niners
''
,
and
was
to
hold
a
basket
.
One
sees
Costaggini's
rendering
of
the
same
figure
more
than
thirty
feet
away
.
The
photograph
,
Figure
1
of
the
completed
frieze
,
shows
how
,
having
been
separated
from
his
fellows
in
useless
isolation
for
eighty
years
,
he
has
now
been
given
a
hand
,
and
by
juxtaposition
(
and
the
permission
of
the
Committee
)
,
given
a
new
job
,
to
represent
the
witnesses
of
the
first
flight
at
Kitty
Hawk
in
1903
.
The
startlingly
bright
effect
of
the
first
washings
led
the
Committee
to
order
the
rest
of
the
Brumidi-Costaggini
cycle
cleaned
and
restored
to
go
with
them
.
The
fixed
wooden
scaffold
was
removed
,
and
,
so
as
to
reach
all
the
frieze
,
one
of
pipe
,
on
wheels
,
built
up
from
the
floor
.
Every
few
days
,
in
the
early
morning
,
as
the
work
progressed
,
twenty
men
would
appear
to
push
it
ahead
and
to
shift
the
plank
foundation
that
distributed
its
weight
widely
on
the
Rotunda
pavement
,
supported
as
it
is
by
ancient
brick
vaulting
.
On
this
giddy
and
oscillating
platform
over
fifty
feet
from
the
floor
,
after
a
first
dusting
,
we
began
to
wash
.
A
most
useful
tool
for
wetting
the
surface
without
running
down
was
made
from
a
greenhouse
``
mist
spray
''
nozzle
welded
to
a
hose
connection
,
to
be
used
at
low
water
pressure
.
A
valve
in
the
handle
let
us
cut
the
pressure
still
lower
.
One
man
sprayed
,
with
a
sponge
in
hand
to
check
excess
wetting
.
A
second
assistant
mopped
with
two
sponges
.
In
parts
a
repeated
sponging
was
needed
,
but
everywhere
we
found
that
water
alone
was
enough
to
restore
the
original
brightness
.
No
soap
or
other
cleaning
agent
was
used
that
might
bring
in
unwanted
chemical
reactions
.
The
painting
``
a
fresco
''
stood
up
superbly
;
;
a
little
of
the
``
secco
''
came
off
.
Necessary
retouching
was
put
on
at
once
.
Altogether
we
found
the
craftsmanship
first
rate
,
especially
Brumidi's
.
We
were
greatly
helped
by
there
being
no
traces
of
former
restoring
.
Apparently
not
more
than
dusting
had
ever
been
done
,
and
not
much
of
that
.
The
plaster
was
sound
,
the
intonaco
firmly
attached
all
over
,
and
the
pigment
solidly
incorporated
with
it
in
all
but
a
few
unimportant
places
.
The
greatest
source
of
trouble
was
rain
which
had
repeatedly
flowed
from
openings
above
,
soaking
the
surface
and
leaving
streaks
of
dissolved
lime
,
very
conspicuous
even
after
cleaning
,
particularly
in
the
``
Landing
of
Columbus
''
,
``
Oglethorpe
and
the
Indians
''
,
and
``
Yorktown
''
.
Here
the
Architect
,
referring
to
the
use
of
the
Capitol
as
a
public
building
,
not
a
museum
,
requested
some
repainting
to
maintain
decorative
effect
,
rather
than
leaving
blank
,
unsightly
patches
.
These
frescos
have
had
no
care
for
eighty
years
.
With
naked
gas
jets
below
and
leaky
windows
above
,
enough
to
ruin
wall
paintings
in
any
medium
,
they
have
survived
,
in
a
building
long
unheated
in
winter
,
hot
and
damp
under
the
iron
dome
in
summer
.
Those
whom
I
wish
to
address
with
this
letter
are
for
the
most
part
unknown
to
me
.
It
may
well
be
that
,
when
Rudy
Pozzatti
and
I
visited
your
country
last
spring
,
you
were
living
and
working
close
to
the
places
we
saw
and
the
streets
we
walked
.
As
American
artists
,
it
was
natural
that
we
would
want
to
meet
as
many
Soviet
artists
as
possible
.
This
letter
might
not
have
been
necessary
had
our
efforts
to
meet
and
talk
with
you
been
more
successful
.
Even
though
we
did
not
see
many
of
your
faces
,
it
appears
now
quite
evident
that
a
considerable
number
of
your
profession
heard
,
from
those
whom
we
had
the
fortune
to
encounter
,
that
we
had
been
in
your
midst
.
I
am
very
pleased
that
quite
a
number
of
you
found
ways
to
communicate
to
me
your
desire
to
hear
of
our
reactions
and
experiences
in
the
U.S.S.R.
.
I
can
well
understand
your
curiosity
.
We
,
ourselves
,
are
always
eager
to
know
how
others
feel
about
us
and
the
way
in
which
we
live
.
It
is
my
hope
that
this
written
message
and
report
will
reach
you
through
the
good
offices
of
the
Union
of
Soviet
Artists
.
There
should
be
no
reason
to
misinterpret
or
ignore
the
intent
of
this
letter
.
Pozzatti
and
I
endeavored
earnestly
to
record
our
impressions
without
the
prejudice
that
the
anxiety
of
our
time
so
easily
provokes
.
The
time-span
of
little
more
than
a
month
cannot
entitle
me
to
pose
as
an
expert
on
anything
I
saw
.
Too
much
damage
is
done
by
``
experts
''
who
have
spent
even
less
time
,
if
any
at
all
,
in
the
U.S.S.R.
.
Nevertheless
I
consider
it
reasonable
,
because
of
my
commitment
as
an
artist
,
to
assume
that
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
creative
individuals
are
related
to
humanity
as
a
whole
rather
than
to
specific
geo-political
interests
.
If
this
attitude
is
seriously
questioned
in
the
Soviet
Union
,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
majority
of
the
society
in
which
I
live
is
too
aware
of
the
necessity
for
clarity
on
this
ethical
as
well
as
aesthetic
point
of
view
.
It
is
a
matter
of
some
disappointment
to
me
that
still
many
of
my
own
countrymen
are
too
shortsighted
to
ascribe
any
symbolic
significance
to
the
plight
of
a
minority
,
such
as
artists
,
in
any
social
order
.
I
encountered
many
questions
and
great
interest
upon
my
return
from
the
Soviet
Union
about
my
reactions
to
that
experience
.
That
which
I
found
most
profound
and
most
disturbing
appeared
to
evoke
a
curiously
muted
reaction
.
Almost
as
if
I
were
talking
about
something
quite
unreal
.
Apparently
this
is
not
the
time
and
the
climate
in
which
people
will
listen
objectively
,
or
at
least
dispassionately
,
to
individual
impressions
of
a
subject
which
preoccupies
a
good
deal
of
their
waking
moments
.
Personal
predispositions
tend
to
blunt
the
ear
and
,
in
turn
,
the
voice
as
well
.
I
cannot
be
content
with
the
anecdotal
small
talk
of
a
somewhat
unusual
travelogue
.
I
am
equally
impatient
with
the
shrug
of
the
shoulder
,
shake
of
the
head
of
those
who
no
longer
care
because
they
have
known
it
for
so
long
;
;
the
aggressive
disbelief
of
those
who
are
romantically
lost
in
a
semantic
jungle
of
the
word
``
Revolution
''
;
;
the
belligerent
denunciations
by
the
sick
fanatics
of
ignorance
who
try
to
build
a
papier-mache
wall
of
pseudo-patriotism
on
our
physical
horizons
.
Difficult
as
it
may
have
been
at
times
,
Pozzatti
and
I
saw
enough
,
talked
to
enough
artists
,
historians
and
others
to
realize
that
the
issue
is
quite
clear
.
Artists
and
poets
are
the
raw
nerve-ends
of
humanity
;
;
they
are
small
in
number
and
their
contribution
is
not
immediately
decisive
in
everyday
life
.
By
themselves
they
may
not
be
able
to
save
the
life
on
this
planet
,
but
without
them
there
would
be
very
little
left
worth
saving
.
It
cannot
be
said
that
our
very
first
day
in
the
Soviet
Union
turned
out
to
be
an
ordinary
one
.
On
that
cold
,
but
bright
,
April
day
we
were
guests
of
your
government
in
the
reviewing
stand
of
Red
Square
to
witness
the
poeple's
celebration
for
Yuri
Gagarin
and
later
on
that
day
we
attended
the
somewhat
more
exclusive
reception
for
him
in
one
of
the
impressive
palaces
of
the
Kremlin
.
If
we
thus
spent
our
very
first
day
in
the
midst
of
a
large
number
of
your
people
honoring
a
new
hero
and
a
great
national
achievement
,
our
last
day
,
to
us
at
least
,
was
equally
impressive
and
very
moving
,
even
though
the
crowds
were
absent
and
there
was
almost
complete
silence
.
We
stood
under
a
gigantic
tree
in
the
rolling
country
just
outside
of
Moscow
looking
at
silent
flowers
on
the
grave
of
a
Russian
poet
and
writer
who
cherished
the
love
for
his
country
to
the
point
of
foregoing
the
highest
international
honor
.
The
grave
,
about
half-way
between
his
home
and
the
blue
turrets
of
a
small
church
,
rose
above
the
forms
and
spaces
of
gently
undisciplined
pastures
of
green
,
the
sounds
of
birds
,
the
silence
of
other
graves
and
the
casual
paths
through
small
forests
.
Just
yesterday
we
had
met
and
talked
with
a
living
writer
,
a
contemporary
of
the
dead
poet
,
who
is
known
for
his
ability
of
manipulating
his
ideas
and
his
craft
more
advantageously
.
But
today
we
were
aware
of
only
two
men
.
One
had
taken
a
flight
into
uncharted
space
,
in
the
service
of
science
,
to
return
as
a
living
hero
.
The
other
had
assumed
the
right
to
explore
the
equally
uncharted
space
of
the
human
spirit
.
The
flowers
on
his
grave
attested
to
the
fact
that
he
as
well
was
somebody's
hero
.
These
two
recollections
form
the
frame
around
a
series
of
experiences
and
sights
which
,
to
me
at
least
,
symbolize
the
extremes
in
the
aesthetic
as
well
as
ethical
conflict
between
materialism
and
humanism
.
A
struggle
that
is
being
waged
all
over
the
world
in
the
half-light
of
disinterest
.
The
prevalent
opinion
which
we
encountered
in
a
variety
of
expressions
in
your
country
denied
not
only
the
existence
of
this
conflict
but
it
was
elaborated
even
further
with
an
incredible
semantic
dexterity
.
The
socialist
environment
,
it
was
stated
,
had
cross-fertilized
these
two
extreme
seeds
and
was
about
to
produce
a
new
plant
and
fruit
.
When
I
speculated
on
one
such
occasion
that
the
new
growth
,
like
other
mutations
,
might
be
unable
to
propagate
,
I
was
immediately
accused
of
preaching
racial
prejudice
.
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
answer
that
``
some
of
my
best
friends
are
non-propagating
mules
''
.
This
kind
of
reasoning
and
logic
takes
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
.
After
a
while
we
were
perhaps
less
surprised
,
but
still
puzzled
,
when
a
friendly
discussion
would
suddenly
jump
the
track
into
the
most
irrelevant
and
illogical
comparisons
.
A
chance
remark
about
Lenin's
sealed
train
brought
the
rejoinder
that
this
was
a
myth
akin
to
George
Washington's
cherry
tree
.
Theories
of
the
behavior
pattern
of
population
masses
were
compared
to
scientific
discoveries
concerning
the
motion-pattern
of
gaseous
masses
.
No
wonder
that
Pozzatti
and
I
had
at
times
difficulty
in
remembering
the
real
purpose
of
our
presence
,
namely
,
Cultural
Exchange
.
Typical
of
such
an
experience
was
the
occasion
of
a
somewhat
formal
official
welcome
in
the
offices
of
the
Union
of
Soviet
Artists
.
We
had
looked
forward
to
what
we
hoped
to
be
our
first
informal
meeting
with
a
number
of
Moscow's
artists
.
Instead
,
we
became
involved
in
a
series
of
friendly
,
but
overly
formal
,
welcoming
addresses
to
which
we
had
no
choice
but
to
reply
in
kind
.
The
terms
of
friendship
,
understanding
,
cooperation
,
etc.
,
tend
to
become
somewhat
shopworn
because
of
constant
and
indiscriminate
use
.
I
can
only
hope
that
the
continuing
exchange
of
groups
and
individuals
between
our
countries
will
not
wear
out
all
language
pertinent
to
the
occasion
.
The
presiding
female
functionary
,
of
massive
proportions
and
forbidding
appearance
,
initially
did
not
contribute
to
the
expressions
of
friendship
and
welcome
by
a
number
of
dignified
gentlemen
representing
the
arts
.
It
was
only
after
we
had
responded
,
with
what
I
fear
were
similar
cliches
,
that
she
went
into
action
by
questioning
our
desire
for
friendship
and
understanding
with
a
challenge
about
aggressive
and
warlike
actions
by
the
U.S.
Government
in
Cuba
and
Laos
.
She
retreated
by
leaving
the
room
when
we
suggested
that
our
meeting
might
well
terminate
right
then
and
there
.
Unfortunately
she
returned
later
,
just
as
I
had
taken
advantage
of
the
friendlier
atmosphere
in
the
room
by
stating
that
perhaps
an
unexpected
result
of
the
Cultural
Exchange
Program
would
be
the
re-emergence
of
Abstract
Art
in
Russia
,
with
Social
Realism
regaining
dominance
in
the
U.S.
.
This
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
ring
down
the
curtain
with
the
petulant
admonition
that
we
should
not
presume
to
lecture
her
on
Abstraction
.
She
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
as
was
done
on
other
occasions
,
that
Abstraction
as
well
as
Impressionism
were
a
Russian
invention
that
had
been
discarded
as
unwanted
by
the
people
of
the
U.S.S.R.
.
Pozzatti
and
I
could
not
know
then
that
we
would
experience
this
sort
of
treatment
more
often
in
Moscow
than
elsewhere
.
We
were
to
discover
,
in
fact
,
that
quite
a
number
of
people
share
with
us
the
impression
that
,
in
contrast
to
other
Soviet
regions
,
Moscow's
atmosphere
is
depressingly
subdued
and
official
.
