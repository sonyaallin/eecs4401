Since
Laos
is
of
no
more
purely
military
value
to
Moscow
itself
than
it
is
to
Washington
,
this
approach
might
be
expected
to
head
off
Mr.
Khrushchev
for
the
moment
.
But
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
military
situation
in
Laos
,
the
Soviet
leader
must
be
tempted
to
let
things
ride
--
a
course
that
would
appear
to
cost
him
little
on
the
spot
,
but
would
bog
Washington
in
a
tactical
mess
.
As
wars
go
,
Laos
is
an
extremely
little
one
.
Casualties
have
been
running
about
a
dozen
men
a
day
.
The
hard
core
of
the
pro-Communist
rebel
force
numbers
only
some
2,000
tough
Viet
Minh
guerrilla
fighters
.
But
for
the
United
States
and
its
SEATO
allies
to
attempt
to
shore
up
a
less
tough
,
less
combat-tested
government
army
in
monsoon-shrouded
,
road-shy
,
guerrilla-th'-wisp
terrain
is
a
risk
not
savored
by
Pentagon
planners
.
But
if
anything
can
bring
home
to
Mr.
Khrushchev
the
idea
that
he
will
not
really
get
much
enjoyment
from
watching
this
Braddock-against-the-Indians
contest
,
it
will
probably
be
the
fact
that
SEATO
forces
are
ready
to
attempt
it
--
plus
the
fact
that
Moscow
has
something
to
lose
from
closing
off
disarmament
and
other
bigger
negotiations
with
Washington
.
Fortunately
both
the
Republicans
and
America's
chief
Western
allies
now
are
joined
behind
the
neutral
Laos
aim
of
the
President
.
Actually
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
leader
of
the
alliance
now
has
swung
fully
behind
the
British
policy
of
seeking
to
achieve
a
neutral
Laos
via
the
international
bargaining
table
.
It
is
ironic
that
Washington
is
having
to
struggle
so
for
a
concept
that
for
six
years
it
bypassed
as
unreasonable
.
The
State
Department
tacitly
rejected
the
neutral
Laos
idea
after
the
Geneva
conference
of
1954
,
and
last
year
Washington
backed
the
rightist
coup
that
ousted
neutral
Premier
Souvanna
Phouma
.
But
since
last
fall
the
United
States
has
been
moving
toward
a
pro-neutralist
position
and
now
is
ready
to
back
the
British
plan
for
a
cease-fire
patrolled
by
outside
observers
and
followed
by
a
conference
of
interested
powers
.
The
road
to
a
guaranteed-neutral
,
coup-proof
Laos
is
today
almost
as
difficult
as
warfare
on
that
nation's
terrain
.
But
for
the
safety
of
Southeast
Asia
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
Laotian
people
--
who
would
not
be
well-ruled
by
either
militant
minority
now
engaged
in
the
fighting
--
this
last
big
effort
to
seal
that
country
from
the
cold
war
had
to
be
made
.
