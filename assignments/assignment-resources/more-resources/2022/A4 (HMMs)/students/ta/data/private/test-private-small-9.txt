The
plane
was
sent
back
to
the
United
States
,
for
a
change
,
but
Castro
kept
the
crazy
gunman
,
who
will
prove
a
suitable
recruit
to
the
revolution
.
Less
respect
for
the
legal
conventions
was
displayed
by
Castro's
right
hand
man
,
Che
Guevara
,
who
edified
the
Inter-American
Economic
and
Social
council
meeting
in
Montevideo
by
reading
two
secret
American
documents
purloined
from
the
United
States
embassy
at
Caracas
,
Venezuela
.
The
contents
were
highly
embarrassing
to
American
spokesmen
,
who
were
on
hand
to
promise
Latin
Americans
a
20
billion
dollar
foreign
aid
millennium
.
Perhaps
the
moralities
of
world
law
are
not
advanced
by
stealing
American
diplomatic
papers
and
planes
,
but
the
Kennedy
administration
can
always
file
a
demurrer
to
the
effect
that
,
but
for
its
own
incompetence
in
protecting
American
interests
,
these
things
would
not
happen
.
The
same
can
be
said
about
the
half-hearted
Cuban
invasion
mounted
by
the
administration
last
April
,
which
,
we
trust
,
is
not
symptomatic
of
the
methods
to
be
invoked
in
holding
off
the
felonious
Khrushchev
.
Pass
the
iron
rations
,
please
,
and
light
another
candle
,
for
it's
getting
dark
down
here
and
we're
minded
to
read
a
bit
of
world
law
just
to
pass
the
time
away
.
The
customer
loses
again
.
The
board
of
suspension
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
commission
has
ordered
a
group
of
railroads
not
to
reduce
their
freight
rates
on
grain
,
as
they
had
planned
to
do
this
month
.
The
request
for
lower
rates
originated
with
the
Southern
railway
,
which
has
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
and
money
developing
a
100-ton
hopper
car
with
which
it
says
it
can
move
grain
at
about
half
what
it
costs
in
the
conventional
,
smaller
car
.
By
reducing
rates
as
much
as
60
per
cent
,
it
and
its
associated
railroads
hope
to
win
back
some
of
the
business
they
have
lost
to
truckers
and
barge
lines
.
The
board's
action
shows
what
free
enterprise
is
up
against
in
our
complex
maze
of
regulatory
laws
.
A
shock
wave
from
Africa
Word
of
Dag
Hammarskjold's
death
in
an
African
plane
crash
has
sent
a
shockwave
around
the
globe
.
As
head
of
the
United
Nations
he
was
the
symbol
of
world
peace
,
and
his
tragic
end
came
at
a
moment
when
peace
hangs
precariously
.
