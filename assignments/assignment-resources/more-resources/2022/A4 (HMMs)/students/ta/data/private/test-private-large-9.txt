But
there
wasn't
no
use
in
me
staying
there
.
I
couldn't
fight
a
dozen
or
so
of
'em
.
If
I'd
stayed
,
all
that
I'd
have
got
was
four
punctured
tires
and
one
busted
head
.
Why
didn't
you
wait
at
the
Burch
house
?
?
You
must've
known
I'd
gone
to
get
the
sheriff
.
I
was
lucky
they
let
me
go
,
I
guess
''
.
The
sheriff
was
occupied
with
maneuvering
the
car
around
in
a
very
narrow
space
.
When
it
was
finally
pointed
east
,
he
said
,
``
You
should
never
have
come
out
here
alone
.
This
is
redneck
country
.
Every
man
in
every
one
of
these
houses
is
a
Night
Rider
.
Then
he
turned
the
telephone
over
to
Rourke
,
and
went
into
the
bedroom
to
change
his
slippers
for
dry
socks
and
shoes
.
Rourke
was
talking
on
the
phone
when
he
came
back
.
``
About
an
hour
,
eh
?
?
Are
you
positive
''
?
?
He
listened
a
moment
and
then
said
,
``
Hold
it
''
.
He
turned
his
head
and
said
,
``
Alvarez
will
definitely
be
in
a
back
room
at
the
Jai
Alai
Club
on
South
Beach
within
an
hour
.
Want
to
try
and
meet
him
there
''
?
?
Shayne
looked
at
his
watch
.
That
wasn't
too
far
from
Fifth
Street
,
and
should
allow
him
to
make
Scotty's
Bar
by
midnight
.
He
said
with
satisfaction
,
``
That's
fine
,
Tim
.
I'll
be
there
''
.
Rourke
confirmed
the
appointment
over
the
phone
and
hung
up
.
``
I
don't
know
what
you're
getting
into
,
Mike
''
,
he
said
unhappily
.
``
I
hope
to
Christ
.
''
Shayne
said
briskly
,
``
Grab
another
drink
if
you
want
it
.
We've
got
one
other
call
to
make
before
I
meet
Alvarez
''
.
``
Where
''
?
?
``
It's
out
in
the
Northeast
section
.
Have
you
got
my
car
here
''
?
?
``
It's
parked
in
front
''
.
Rourke
hastily
slopped
whiskey
into
his
glass
on
top
of
half-melted
ice-cubes
.
``
I'd
better
keep
on
driving
yours
''
,
Shayne
decided
,
``
because
I'll
be
going
on
over
to
the
Beach
.
I
can
drop
you
back
here
to
pick
mine
up
''
.
He
went
to
a
closet
to
get
a
light
jacket
,
and
took
his
hat
from
beside
the
door
.
Timothy
Rourke
gulped
down
the
whiskey
hastily
and
joined
him
,
asking
,
``
Who
are
we
going
to
call
on
in
the
Northeast
section
''
?
?
``
A
lady
.
That
is
,
maybe
not
too
much
of
a
lady
.
At
least
,
I
want
to
find
out
whether
she's
home
yet
or
not
''
.
He
opened
the
door
and
followed
Rourke
out
.
In
Rourke's
car
,
Shayne
drove
east
to
Biscayne
Boulevard
and
north
toward
Felice
Perrin's
address
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
Peralta
governess
.
As
he
drove
,
he
filled
in
Timothy
Rourke
briefly
on
the
events
of
the
evening
after
leaving
the
reporter
to
go
to
the
Peralta
house
,
and
on
his
own
surmises
.
``
I
want
to
be
in
Scotty's
Bar
at
midnight
when
Marsha
makes
her
phone
call
there
''
,
he
ended
grimly
.
``
I
don't
know
whether
that
threatening
letter
of
hers
has
anything
to
do
with
this
situation
or
not
,
but
I
want
to
see
who
takes
the
call
''
.
``
This
deal
at
Las
Putas
Buenas
where
the
two
knife-men
jumped
you
''
,
said
Rourke
with
interest
,
``
that
sounds
like
it
was
set
up
with
malice
aforethought
by
the
luscious
Mrs.
Peralta
,
doesn't
it
''
?
?
``
It
does
''
,
Shayne
grunted
sourly
,
still
able
to
taste
her
mouth
on
his
in
the
Green
Jungle
parking
lot
.
``
That
story
of
hers
about
an
unsigned
note
directing
her
to
be
there
tonight
sounds
completely
phony
.
If
it
was
designed
to
put
me
on
the
spot
,
it
would
have
to
have
been
written
before
Peralta
ever
called
me
in
on
the
case
''
.
``
Do
you
think
Laura
did
have
the
counterfeit
bracelet
made
without
her
husband's
knowledge
''
?
?
``
I
haven't
the
faintest
idea
.
I
think
her
husband
strongly
suspects
so
,
and
that's
why
he
called
me
in
on
the
thing
in
direct
defiance
of
his
confederates
and
almost
certainly
without
telling
them
why
he
was
doing
so
.
Isn't
this
Felice's
street
''
?
?
Shayne
asked
,
peering
ahead
at
the
partially
obscured
street
sign
.
Rourke
could
see
it
better
out
the
right-hand
side
,
and
he
said
,
``
yes
.
Turn
to
the
left
,
I
think
,
for
that
number
you
gave
me
.
Not
more
than
a
block
or
so
''
.
Shayne
got
in
the
left-hand
lane
and
cut
across
the
Boulevard
divider
.
There
was
a
small
,
neon-lighted
restaurant
and
cocktail
lounge
on
the
southeast
corner
of
the
intersection
as
he
turned
into
the
quiet
,
palm-lined
street
where
most
of
the
houses
on
both
sides
were
older
two-story
mansions
,
now
cut
up
into
furnished
rooms
and
housekeeping
apartments
.
Shayne
drove
westward
from
the
Boulevard
slowly
,
letting
Rourke
crane
his
head
out
the
window
and
watch
for
street
numbers
.
A
single
automobile
was
parked
half-way
up
the
block
on
the
left-hand
side
.
Shayne
noted
idly
that
it
carried
Miami
Beach
license
plates
as
he
approached
,
and
then
saw
the
flare
of
a
match
in
the
front
seat
as
they
passed
,
indicating
that
it
was
occupied
.
He
turned
to
see
the
briefly-illumed
faces
of
two
men
in
the
parked
car
just
as
Rourke
said
,
``
It's
the
next
house
,
Mike
.
On
the
right
''
.
Instead
of
pulling
into
the
curb
,
Shayne
increased
his
speed
slightly
to
the
corner
where
he
swung
left
.
He
went
around
the
corner
and
parked
,
turning
off
his
lights
and
motor
.
``
I
told
you
,
Mike
''
,
said
Rourke
in
an
aggrieved
voice
.
``
It
was
back
there
.
''
Shayne
said
,
``
I
know
it
was
,
Tim
''
.
His
voice
was
chilling
and
cold
.
``
Did
you
see
the
car
parked
across
the
street
''
?
?
``
I
didn't
notice
it
.
I
was
watching
for
numbers
.
''
``
It
has
a
Beach
license
,
Tim
.
Two
men
in
the
front
seat
.
I
got
a
quick
look
at
their
faces
as
we
went
past
.
Unless
I'm
crazy
as
hell
,
they're
two
of
Painter's
dicks
.
A
couple
named
Harris
and
Geely
.
Those
names
mean
anything
to
you
''
?
?
``
Wait
a
minute
,
Mike
.
In
Painter's
office
this
evening
.
''
Shayne
nodded
grimly
.
``
The
pair
whom
Petey
is
officially
commending
for
slapping
me
around
and
pulling
me
in
''
.
``
What
are
they
doing
here
''
?
?
``
A
stake-out
,
I
suppose
.
On
Felice
Perrin
.
Maybe
with
specific
orders
to
see
that
I
don't
make
contact
with
her
.
I'm
not
positive
,
Tim
.
I
may
be
wrong
.
I'll
slide
out
and
walk
around
the
block
back
to
the
cocktail
lounge
on
Biscayne
.
You
drive
on
and
circle
back
and
pull
up
beside
them
parked
there
.
You're
a
reporter
,
and
you're
looking
for
Miss
Perrin
to
interview
her
.
Make
them
show
their
hands
.
If
they
are
Beach
cops
on
a
stake-out
,
they'll
admit
it
to
a
reporter
.
They've
got
no
official
standing
on
this
side
of
the
Bay
.
As
soon
as
you
find
out
if
they
are
Geely
and
Harris
,
come
on
around
to
the
lounge
where
I'll
be
waiting
''
.
Shayne
opened
the
door
on
his
side
and
stepped
out
.
Timothy
Rourke
groaned
dismally
as
he
slid
under
the
wheel
.
``
The
things
you
talk
me
into
,
Mike
.
''
Shayne
chuckled
.
``
How
often
do
they
add
up
to
headlines
?
?
You
should
complain
''
.
He
crossed
the
street
and
walked
swiftly
southward
to
circle
back
to
the
Boulevard
and
north
a
block
to
the
open
restaurant
.
He
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
bar
enjoying
a
slug
of
cognac
when
Rourke
came
in
six
or
eight
minutes
later
.
The
reporter
nodded
as
he
moved
up
beside
him
at
the
bar
.
Shayne
told
the
bartender
,
``
Bourbon
and
water
''
,
and
Rourke
told
him
,
``
It's
those
two
,
all
right
.
Harris
and
Geely
.
I
made
them
show
me
their
identification
before
I
could
be
persuaded
not
to
call
on
Felice
Perrin
''
.
Shayne
said
happily
,
``
I've
got
it
all
worked
out
,
Tim
.
Take
your
time
with
your
drink
.
I'll
beat
it
.
In
exactly
three
minutes
,
go
in
that
phone
booth
behind
you
and
call
Police
Headquarters
.
Be
excited
and
don't
identify
yourself
.
Just
say
that
a
couple
of
drunks
are
having
a
hell
of
a
fight
down
the
street
,
and
they
better
send
a
patrol
car
.
Then
hang
up
fast
and
come
walking
on
down
to
the
Perrin
address
.
I'll
be
waiting
for
you
there
''
.
The
bartender
brought
Rourke's
drink
and
Shayne
laid
a
twenty-dollar
bill
on
the
bar
.
He
said
in
a
low
voice
,
``
I've
got
a
date
with
a
lady
,
Mister
.
Will
that
pay
for
a
pint
I
can
take
with
me
.
You
know
how
it
is
''
,
he
added
with
a
conspiratorial
wink
.
``
Candy
is
dandy
,
but
liquor
is
quicker
and
you
don't
have
any
candy
for
sale
here
anyhow
''
.
``
We
sure
don't
''
.
The
bartender
winked
back
at
him
and
palmed
the
bill
.
He
turned
away
and
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
pint
of
brandy
in
a
small
paper
sack
which
he
slid
over
the
counter
to
Shayne
.
As
the
detective
slid
it
into
his
pocket
,
Rourke
asked
sadly
,
``
What
in
hell
are
you
going
to
do
,
Mike
''
?
?
``
Make
a
couple
of
punk
detectives
named
Geely
and
Harris
wish
to
God
they'd
stayed
out
of
my
way
this
afternoon
.
Three
minutes
,
Tim
''
.
Shayne
strode
out
blithely
,
and
Rourke
checked
his
watch
and
sipped
his
drink
,
getting
a
dime
ready
to
make
the
telephone
call
to
the
police
.
Outside
,
Shayne
hesitated
when
he
saw
that
Rourke
had
parked
his
coupe
directly
in
front
of
the
bar
headed
south
.
He
walked
over
to
the
right-hand
door
,
opened
it
and
got
the
reloaded
automatic
out
of
the
glove
compartment
and
put
it
in
his
hip
pocket
.
He
hoped
he
wouldn't
be
forced
to
use
it
in
taking
care
of
the
Beach
detectives
,
but
its
weight
was
comforting
at
his
hip
.
On
this
side
of
the
Bay
,
Miami
Beach
cops
had
no
more
legal
rights
than
any
ordinary
citizen
,
and
Shayne's
pistol
permit
was
just
as
good
as
theirs
.
He
went
swiftly
up
the
sidewalk
toward
the
parked
car
with
the
two
Beach
detectives
in
the
front
seat
.
He
tugged
the
brim
of
his
hat
low
as
he
approached
,
stepped
out
into
the
street
just
behind
the
car
and
strode
around
to
the
right-hand
side
.
The
big
,
paunchy
man
named
Geely
was
on
that
side
,
half-turned
in
the
seat
toward
his
hatchet-faced
companion
so
that
his
back
partially
rested
against
the
closed
door
.
Shayne
turned
the
handle
and
jerked
the
door
open
before
either
of
the
men
were
quite
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
night
.
Geely
grunted
and
slid
partly
out
,
and
Shayne's
left
arm
snaked
in
around
his
neck
to
help
him
,
while
he
set
himself
solidly
on
the
roadway
and
swung
his
right
fist
to
the
big
,
gum-chewing
jaw
before
Geely
could
straighten
up
.
Shayne
stepped
back
to
let
him
slump
to
the
ground
,
and
then
dived
over
him
through
the
open
door
into
Harris
who
was
cursing
loudly
and
trying
to
drag
a
gun
from
a
shoulder
holster
,
somewhat
impeded
by
the
steering
wheel
.
Shayne
locked
his
big
hands
around
Harris'
thin
neck
and
dragged
him
out
over
the
seat
into
the
roadway
.
He
hit
him
once
on
the
sharp
point
of
his
chin
and
felt
the
body
go
limp
.
He
dropped
him
into
the
street
a
couple
of
feet
away
from
Geely's
recumbent
figure
and
stared
down
at
both
of
them
for
a
moment
before
kicking
the
big
man
lightly
in
the
side
.
He
didn't
stir
.
They
were
both
breathing
heavily
,
out
cold
,
and
Shayne
didn't
think
either
of
them
had
recognized
him
or
could
describe
him
.
He
got
the
pint
of
liquor
out
of
his
pocket
and
unscrewed
the
top
,
sprinkled
the
pungent
stuff
liberally
over
both
men
,
and
then
tossed
the
open
bottle
in
on
the
front
seat
.
He
turned
,
then
,
to
look
toward
the
lighted
Boulevard
,
and
saw
Rourke's
tall
,
emaciated
figure
come
out
of
the
lounge
and
hurriedly
start
to
angle
across
the
street
toward
the
opposite
side
.
Shayne
strolled
across
to
intercept
the
reporter
in
front
of
the
two-story
house
where
Felice
Perrin
lived
,
and
asked
casually
,
``
Get
the
police
okay
''
?
?
``
Sure
.
Said
they'd
have
a
patrol
car
here
fast
.
Let's
get
inside
.
What
happened
with
you
''
?
?
``
Why
the
two
damned
fools
got
all
excited
when
they
saw
the
bottle
,
and
knocked
each
other
out
cold
''
,
Shayne
said
good-humoredly
.
``
They'll
have
fun
explaining
that
to
the
Miami
cops
.
Got
no
business
over
here
on
a
stake-out
anyway
''
.
They
went
up
onto
a
front
porch
and
into
a
small
hallway
where
a
dim
bulb
burned
high
in
the
ceiling
.
A
row
of
mailboxes
along
the
wall
had
numbers
and
names
on
them
.
Shayne
found
one
marked
Perrin
Aj
.
The
stairway
on
the
right
was
dark
,
but
there
was
a
wall-switch
at
the
bottom
which
lighted
another
dim
bulb
at
the
top
,
and
they
went
up
.
There
were
two
front
rooms
,
both
dark
behind
their
transoms
,
and
there
was
no
sound
or
light
in
the
entire
house
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
occupants
were
awake
.
Eight
,
nine
steps
above
him
,
Roberts
had
paused
.
Mickey
paused
with
him
,
waiting
,
no
longer
impatient
,
trying
now
to
think
it
out
,
do
a
little
planning
.
He
looked
down
over
the
banister
at
the
hotel
desk
,
with
the
telephone
and
pen
set
.
If
I
could
call
in
,
they
could
check
the
story
while
we
were
on
our
way
.
I
wouldn't
have
to
tell
them
I
had
Roberts
--
Then
he
heard
it
,
like
a
muffled
thud
,
felt
a
subtle
change
in
air
pressure
.
He
glanced
up
in
time
to
see
Roberts
hurtling
down
on
him
from
above
,
literally
flying
through
the
air
,
his
bloody
face
twisted
.
Mickey
tried
to
flatten
against
the
banister
,
gripped
it
with
one
hand
,
but
Roberts'
full
weight
struck
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
.
He
gasped
for
air
and
the
impact
tore
his
hand
from
the
rail
.
He
tumbled
with
Roberts
,
helpless
and
in
agony
,
over
and
over
,
down
the
steps
.
By
a
wrenching
effort
,
he
managed
to
hunch
and
draw
in
,
to
take
the
final
fall
on
his
back
and
shoulders
rather
than
his
head
.
He
was
fuzzy
in
his
mind
and
,
for
a
moment
,
helpless
on
the
lobby
floor
,
but
he
was
conscious
,
and
free
of
the
weight
of
Roberts'
body
.
When
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
taller
one
scrambling
upward
,
reaching
.
Mickey
was
on
his
knees
when
Roberts
turned
on
the
stairs
and
the
razor
flashed
in
his
hand
.
He
felt
his
empty
pocket
and
knew
that
Roberts
had
retrieved
the
only
weapon
at
hand
.
Mickey's
eyes
fixed
on
the
other's
feet
,
which
would
first
betray
the
moment
and
direction
of
an
attack
.
He
rose
stiffly
,
forcing
his
knees
to
lock
.
The
knifelike
pain
in
his
groin
nearly
brought
him
down
again
.
He
made
himself
back
off
slowly
,
his
eyes
wary
on
Roberts
,
who
now
had
no
more
to
lose
than
he
.
The
pain
dulled
as
he
moved
,
and
he
steadied
inside
.
After
a
moment
he
extended
one
hand
,
the
fingers
curled
.
``
Come
on
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
want
to
be
that
big
a
fool
--
I
was
hoping
for
this
''
.
Roberts
brushed
at
his
eyes
with
his
free
hand
and
started
down
the
steps
.
He
held
the
razor
well
out
to
one
side
.
He
was
invulnerable
to
attack
,
but
he
could
be
handled
,
Mickey
knew
,
if
he
could
be
brought
to
make
the
first
move
.
They
were
eight
feet
apart
when
Roberts
cleared
the
last
step
.
Mickey
waited
with
slack
arms
.
``
Any
time
,
Roberts
''
,
he
said
.
``
Or
would
it
be
easier
if
I
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
''
?
?
The
taunt
was
lost
on
Roberts
.
He
advanced
slowly
,
directly
,
giving
no
hint
of
a
feint
to
either
side
.
He
was
just
short
of
arm's
reach
when
he
stopped
.
Mickey
backed
off
two
steps
,
forcing
him
to
come
on
again
.
There
was
a
fixed
grin
on
Roberts'
face
,
made
hideous
by
the
swollen
nose
and
the
smeared
blood
.
Mickey
backed
off
again
and
Roberts
hesitated
,
then
came
along
.
They
moved
in
a
series
of
rhythmic
fits
and
starts
,
a
macabre
dance
--
two
steps
back
,
two
steps
forward
,
two
steps
back
.
Mickey
felt
his
shoulders
come
up
against
the
wall
beside
the
heavy
slab
front
door
.
This
was
going
to
be
it
now
,
any
second
,
and
what
he
had
to
remember
was
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
razor
,
no
matter
what
,
even
if
Roberts
should
feint
with
a
kick
to
the
groin
,
the
deadly
hand
was
his
exclusive
concern
.
The
kick
came
,
sudden
and
vicious
but
short
.
Mickey's
guts
twisted
with
the
effort
,
but
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
weapon
.
It
moved
in
a
silver
arc
toward
his
throat
,
then
veered
downward
.
He
hunched
his
left
shoulder
into
it
and
slashed
at
Roberts'
forearm
with
his
own
,
felt
the
blade
slide
off
his
sleeve
.
Before
Roberts
could
move
inside
to
cut
upward
toward
his
face
,
he
slammed
his
right
fist
into
Roberts'
belly
.
Roberts
sagged
and
slashed
at
him
wildly
.
Ducking
,
Mickey
tripped
and
fell
to
one
side
,
landing
heavily
on
the
wood
floor
.
Then
Roberts
was
on
him
,
gasping
for
breath
and
for
a
couple
of
seconds
Mickey
lost
sight
of
the
blade
.
He
felt
it
rip
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
.
He
got
a
knee
up
into
Roberts'
belly
,
used
both
hands
and
heaved
him
clear
,
then
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
They
were
in
the
center
of
the
lobby
now
.
Still
clutching
the
razor
,
Roberts
came
up
into
a
crouch
,
shaking
his
head
.
When
he
charged
Mickey
was
ready
.
He
hit
Roberts
with
his
left
fist
in
the
ribs
and
the
razor
cut
toward
him
feebly
,
then
wobbled
in
mid-air
.
With
his
right
fist
,
and
nearly
all
his
weight
behind
it
,
he
smashed
at
the
bloodstained
face
.
Roberts
careened
backward
,
his
back
arched
,
fought
for
balance
and
,
failing
,
stumbled
against
the
newel
post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
The
sound
of
his
head
striking
the
solid
wood
was
an
ultimate
,
sudden-end
sound
.
He
fell
on
his
side
across
the
lowest
step
,
rolled
over
once
,
then
lay
still
.
Mickey
found
himself
leaning
against
the
desk
,
with
stiff
hands
,
panting
for
breath
.
After
a
minute
he
went
to
Roberts
,
looked
at
one
of
his
eyes
and
felt
for
a
pulse
.
He
couldn't
feel
any
.
Roberts
appeared
to
be
dead
;
;
if
not
yet
,
then
soon
,
very
soon
.
Suddenly
it
was
cold
in
the
lobby
.
12
It
seemed
to
him
that
a
long
time
had
passed
before
he
decided
what
to
do
.
Actually
it
was
no
more
than
eight
or
ten
minutes
,
and
the
sum
of
his
reasoning
came
to
this
:
There's
no
way
to
take
him
in
now
and
keep
those
other
two
--
Wister
and
the
one
who
hired
the
two
of
them
--
from
finding
out
about
Roberts
and
lamming
out
.
The
local
law
here
would
hold
me
till
they
check
clear
back
home
,
and
maybe
more
than
that
.
They
would
have
to
.
By
then
they
could
never
catch
up
with
the
others
.
There's
no
other
way
;
;
I'll
have
to
do
it
myself
.
He
looked
at
where
Roberts
lay
sprawled
on
the
step
.
Mickey
was
sure
now
he
was
dead
.
One
thing
,
he
thought
,
nobody
knows
about
it
yet
.
Only
me
.
He
climbed
the
stairs
,
went
into
Roberts'
room
,
found
a
suitcase
and
packed
as
much
into
it
as
he
could
.
He
left
a
few
things
.
It
didn't
have
to
be
perfect
.
Roberts
was
a
wastrel
.
Walking
away
on
impulse
,
he
might
logically
leave
behind
what
it
was
inconvenient
to
carry
.
When
he
had
closed
the
suitcase
he
found
a
rag
and
moved
about
the
room
,
wiping
carefully
everything
he
might
have
touched
.
It
took
him
nearly
an
hour
.
He
went
to
the
room
he
had
rented
and
got
into
his
overcoat
.
He
left
the
rest
of
his
things
and
returned
to
the
lobby
.
He
set
Roberts'
suitcase
near
the
front
door
,
went
outside
and
walked
back
to
the
garage
.
He
was
mildly
surprised
to
find
it
was
snowing
.
It
snowed
softly
,
silently
,
an
undulating
interruption
of
his
vision
against
the
night
sky
.
He
could
feel
it
on
his
face
and
in
his
hair
.
He
found
the
key
to
the
Jeep
,
got
it
started
and
warmed
it
up
for
five
minutes
.
Then
he
backed
out
and
swung
around
to
the
front
drive
.
He
went
into
the
hotel
and
searched
till
he
found
the
razor
.
He
put
it
in
his
own
pocket
for
safekeeping
.
He
took
the
suitcase
out
to
the
Jeep
and
put
it
in
the
front
seat
.
Then
he
went
back
for
Roberts
.
The
body
was
heavier
than
he
had
anticipated
.
He
got
it
onto
his
shoulder
after
some
work
and
carried
it
outside
and
down
to
the
Jeep
.
He
dumped
it
into
the
back
and
made
sure
it
wouldn't
roll
out
,
then
returned
to
the
porch
and
closed
the
front
door
,
making
sure
it
was
unlocked
.
He
drove
carefully
in
the
direction
of
the
brief
tour
they
had
taken
earlier
.
It
snowed
continuously
,
but
quietly
,
evenly
.
When
he
reached
the
dip
in
the
woods
,
he
saw
that
already
the
earlier
ruts
were
barely
discernible
.
The
Jeep
fought
its
way
through
the
low
spot
and
got
onto
higher
ground
.
He
drove
in
low
gear
to
the
fork
in
the
road
and
swung
as
close
as
possible
to
the
entrance
to
the
abandoned
mine
.
He
parked
facing
it
and
left
the
headlights
on
,
but
when
he
started
into
the
tunnel
with
the
suitcase
,
he
found
the
illumination
extended
no
farther
than
half
a
dozen
feet
into
the
passage
.
He
went
back
and
got
the
flashlight
,
returned
to
the
tunnel
and
carried
the
suitcase
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
had
found
earlier
.
He
tossed
the
bag
into
the
pit
and
watched
dry
dust
spray
up
around
it
.
When
the
dust
settled
,
he
went
back
to
the
Jeep
and
carefully
worked
Roberts'
body
onto
his
shoulder
.
It
wasn't
like
carrying
the
suitcase
.
The
soft
snow
was
deceitful
underfoot
.
Twice
he
nearly
fell
.
Inside
the
passage
,
he
had
to
work
his
way
over
the
fallen
timber
and
nearly
collapsed
under
his
clumsy
burden
.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
was
panting
and
his
shoulder
and
back
ached
under
the
drag
of
the
dead
weight
.
He
stood
looking
down
for
a
few
seconds
,
then
backed
up
two
or
three
paces
from
the
edge
.
There
was
too
much
weight
casually
to
toss
it
away
.
He
could
feel
himself
falling
in
with
it
and
being
unable
to
get
out
.
It
would
be
a
bad
place
to
die
.
It
was
a
bad
place
for
Roberts
to
wind
up
,
but
Roberts
had
asked
for
it
.
It
was
too
late
to
worry
about
that
.
He
knelt
slowly
and
dumped
the
corpse
onto
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
.
It
was
a
relief
to
get
rid
of
the
weight
.
He
was
shaking
with
tension
and
it
took
him
a
couple
of
minutes
to
get
his
breath
and
settle
down
.
Then
he
got
on
his
knees
and
rolled
Roberts'
body
toward
the
edge
.
It
hung
momentarily
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
.
He
gave
it
a
strong
push
,
heard
it
slide
,
then
tumble
dryly
into
the
hole
.
He
got
to
his
feet
and
threw
the
flashlight
beam
into
the
pit
.
The
body
lay
in
an
awkward
sprawl
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
level
of
the
tunnel
floor
.
Deep
enough
,
he
decided
.
There
was
little
chance
anyone
would
enter
this
shaft
during
the
winter
.
The
external
signs
of
his
approach
to
it
would
be
covered
by
the
snow
,
probably
by
the
next
day
.
It
wasn't
cold
enough
in
the
tunnel
to
preserve
the
body
intact
.
By
spring
it
would
be
a
skeleton
.
He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Jeep
.
He
had
started
to
back
into
the
turn
when
he
remembered
the
razor
in
his
pocket
.
He
climbed
down
,
went
back
into
the
tunnel
and
tossed
the
razor
into
the
pit
.
It
landed
on
Roberts'
sprawled
right
thigh
,
poised
precariously
,
then
slid
off
to
the
ground
.
He
went
back
once
more
to
the
Jeep
and
started
the
short
drive
to
the
hotel
.
In
the
garage
he
checked
the
Jeep
for
signs
of
the
use
he
had
made
of
it
.
There
were
stains
here
and
there
and
he
cleaned
them
off
,
using
an
oiled
rag
he
found
on
a
nail
.
He
wiped
the
steering
wheel
and
all
the
places
he
might
have
touched
the
Jeep
.
He
replaced
the
flashlight
where
it
had
been
stowed
,
got
into
his
own
car
and
backed
it
out
of
the
garage
.
There
were
tire
marks
where
it
had
been
,
but
they
were
overlapped
by
others
and
on
the
dusty
floor
would
not
be
noticeable
except
under
close
scrutiny
.
Liz
Peabody
,
he
thought
,
might
spend
some
time
grieving
for
her
lost
lover
,
but
he
doubted
that
she
would
launch
an
investigation
.
He
judged
her
to
be
a
woman
of
some
pride
,
though
not
much
sense
.
Still
she
would
probably
have
sense
enough
not
to
call
in
the
local
sheriff
to
find
her
boy
friend
who
,
apparently
,
had
run
away
.
He
put
in
a
call
to
Cunningham
from
his
hotel
room
.
The
maid
answered
and
he
decided
Nancy
must
be
at
work
.
Jeb
cautioned
him
not
to
be
too
hopeful
and
then
,
ignoring
his
own
advice
,
said
excitedly
,
``
But
it
does
sound
good
.
A
woman
named
Lisa
who
tells
nobody
anything
about
herself
.
That
courtyard
picture
with
the
same
initials
''
.
``
I'm
not
exactly
jumping
up
and
down
with
enthusiasm
.
I'll
call
you
in
a
day
or
so
''
.
On
the
highway
he
relaxed
and
enjoyed
the
drive
over
Lake
Pontchartrain
and
along
the
coast
.
Gulf
Springs
was
ten
miles
inland
--
more
of
a
quaint
old
coast
town
than
those
along
the
beach
made
garish
by
tourist
attractions
.
He
checked
into
a
motel
and
drove
downtown
.
The
courthouse
was
a
white-stucco
building
minus
the
customary
dome
.
Instead
of
the
usual
straggling
privet
hedges
and
patches
of
bare
dirt
in
most
small-town
squares
,
the
building
was
hemmed
in
by
a
semitropical
growth
of
camellias
and
azaleas
and
a
smooth
lawn
the
improbably
bright-green
shade
of
florist's
grass
.
He
figured
his
best
bet
was
a
call
on
the
sheriff
.
A
clerk
in
the
outer
office
took
him
in
to
Sheriff
Carruthers
,
a
big
,
paunchy
man
with
thick
,
white
hair
and
a
voice
with
a
senatorial
resonance
which
suggested
he
should
be
running
for
higher
office
.
Seated
in
front
of
the
desk
,
Hank
said
,
``
I'm
looking
for
some
information
with
very
little
to
go
on
,
Sheriff
''
.
He
explained
the
background
of
the
case
,
ending
with
the
tenuous
clue
which
had
brought
him
to
Gulf
Springs
.
The
sheriff's
swivel
chair
tilted
back
.
``
So
you're
looking
for
a
woman
who
married
a
man
who
might
have
lived
here
a
year
ago
and
might
have
been
poisoned
.
If
there
was
such
a
person
,
I'm
afraid
she
got
away
with
it
.
Pity
we
don't
know
more
about
him
.
I
think
the
best
bet
is
to
go
through
the
society
columns
of
last
year
and
see
if
any
of
the
grooms
match
with
the
obituaries
a
little
later
.
It'll
be
a
tedious
job
,
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
,
the
old
newspaper
files
are
in
the
basement
here
in
the
county
supervisor's
office
''
.
``
Maybe
the
society
editor
would
remember
a
good-looking
out-of-town
bride
''
.
``
That's
an
idea
.
Mrs.
Calhoun
has
been
society
editor
here
for
twenty-five
years
.
The
editor
says
that
marriages
may
be
made
in
heaven
,
but
weddings
are
made
in
Mrs.
Calhoun's
columns
.
She's
the
one
who
decides
which
wedding
is
to
get
the
lead
space
in
the
Sunday
paper
and
all
that
''
.
He
smiled
.
``
Once
,
when
the
editor
was
just
out
of
the
hospital
from
a
gallstone
operation
,
Mrs.
Calhoun
and
the
mother
of
the
bride
went
out
to
his
house
and
fought
it
out
beside
his
bed
.
She'd
be
sure
to
remember
any
bride
who
was
vague
about
background
.
She'd
have
made
a
great
scientist
dedicated
to
tracking
down
heredity
and
environment
.
She'd
also
remember
if
the
groom
died
later
''
.
He
stood
up
.
``
I
wish
you
good
luck
,
but
please
don't
dig
up
too
tough
a
case
for
me
this
close
to
election
.
If
you
find
out
anything
,
come
on
back
here
and
we'll
get
started
on
it
''
.
Tracking
down
Mrs.
Calhoun
was
like
trying
to
catch
up
with
Paul
Revere
between
Lexington
and
Concord
.
It
turned
out
that
she
also
sold
real
estate
,
cosmetics
,
and
hospital
insurance
.
The
wearying
trek
stretched
into
the
afternoon
--
from
newspaper
plant
to
insurance
office
to
her
house
and
back
to
the
newspaper
,
where
he
found
her
at
five
o'clock
.
She
was
a
large
woman
with
a
frizzled
gray
poodle
cut
and
a
pencil
clamped
like
a
bit
between
her
teeth
while
she
hunted
and
pecked
on
an
old
typewriter
.
It
took
a
couple
of
minutes
to
run
through
her
various
businesses
and
get
down
to
the
one
he
wanted
.
``
Last
year
?
?
Well
,
I
do
remember
one
.
From
Baton
Rouge
.
Married
a
man
named
Vincent
Black
.
I
remember
her
because
she
didn't
want
her
picture
in
the
paper
.
First
bride
like
that
I've
seen
in
twenty-five
years
''
.
``
What
reason
did
she
give
''
?
?
``
Said
she
had
a
breaking-out
on
her
face
--
some
sort
of
allergy
--
and
none
of
her
old
pictures
was
good
enough
.
I
didn't
see
her
till
several
days
later
at
the
wedding
,
and
her
face
looked
like
it
had
never
had
a
blemish
on
it
.
But
,
of
course
,
you
couldn't
see
too
well
through
the
veil
''
.
``
Was
her
name
Lisa
Carmody
''
?
?
``
Now
how
in
hell
would
I
remember
that
''
?
?
``
Never
mind
.
I
can
look
it
up
.
Do
they
still
live
here
''
?
?
``
I
think
they
moved
away
shortly
after
they
were
married
.
He
was
a
salesman
for
something
or
other
and
must
have
been
transferred
.
I'm
sure
it'll
be
in
the
files
.
We
usually
run
a
social
note
when
somebody
moves
away
''
.
He
stood
up
and
thanked
her
.
``
Have
they
inherited
some
money
or
something
''
?
?
She
asked
with
a
reportorial
gleam
in
her
eye
.
He
said
vaguely
,
``
Well
,
it
is
a
little
legal
matter
,
but
nothing
like
that
''
.
He
hurried
across
to
the
courthouse
and
caught
the
sheriff
just
as
he
was
leaving
.
``
Sounds
like
what
you're
after
''
,
he
said
when
Hank
had
finished
.
``
Come
on
,
let's
hurry
down
before
they
lock
up
for
the
day
''
.
In
the
basement
the
sheriff
took
him
to
a
small
,
dingy
office
occupied
by
a
tall
,
thin
man
informal
in
rolled-up
shirt
sleeves
.
``
Mr.
Ferrell
Hirey
Lindsay
,
chairman
of
the
board
of
supervisors
.
Mr.
Ferrell
is
a
private
detective
,
Hirey
.
Wants
to
look
up
something
in
the
newspaper
files
,
so
don't
lock
him
in
here
''
.
``
Sure
''
,
said
Hirey
.
``
I'll
just
leave
the
door
open
.
It
latches
when
you
close
it
,
so
stay
as
long
as
you
like
''
.
Carruthers
crossed
the
room
to
a
metal
door
with
an
open
grillework
in
the
top
half
.
He
pulled
it
open
.
``
Now
don't
shut
this
door
.
It
won't
open
from
inside
.
Before
we
built
the
new
jail
,
we
used
to
keep
prisoners
in
here
overnight
sometimes
when
the
old
jail
got
too
crowded
.
Hirey
treats
himself
a
lot
better
than
we
do
prisoners
.
They
were
a
sight
more
comfortable
than
the
ones
in
the
jail
with
the
cold
air
from
Hirey's
air
conditioner
coming
through
the
grille
''
.
He
walked
past
the
sheriff
into
a
windowless
room
with
shelves
full
of
big
,
leather-bound
volumes
from
floor
to
ceiling
all
around
the
walls
.
A
metal
table
and
four
chairs
stood
in
the
center
.
``
They're
all
here
,
back
to
1865
''
,
Carruthers
told
him
.
``
It's
all
right
to
smoke
,
but
make
sure
your
cigarettes
are
out
before
you
leave
.
And
,
of
course
,
you
know
not
to
take
clippings
''
.
``
I'll
leave
the
air
conditioner
on
for
you
,
Mr.
Ferrell
''
,
said
Hirey
.
``
Don't
forget
to
turn
it
off
and
close
the
door
good
so
it'll
latch
''
.
Hank
thanked
them
and
promised
to
observe
the
rules
.
When
they
had
gone
,
he
stood
for
a
minute
breathing
in
the
mustiness
of
old
paper
and
leather
which
the
busily
thrumming
air
conditioner
couldn't
quite
dispel
.
Chapter
fourteen
In
a
tour
around
the
stacks
,
he
found
that
the
earliest
volumes
began
on
the
left
and
progressed
clockwise
around
the
room
.
An
old
weakness
for
burrowing
in
records
rose
up
to
tempt
him
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
all
here
--
almost
a
century
.
From
reconstruction
to
moon
rockets
.
But
he
pulled
away
from
the
irrelevant
old
volumes
and
walked
around
to
the
newer
ones
.
Last
year's
volume
was
at
the
top
a
couple
of
inches
below
the
ceiling
.
Near
it
was
a
metal
ladder
on
casters
attached
to
the
top
shelf
.
He
pulled
it
over
,
climbed
up
,
and
lifted
out
the
big
volume
,
almost
losing
his
balance
from
the
weight
of
it
.
He
staggered
over
and
dropped
it
on
the
table
.
Since
Mrs.
Calhoun
remembered
only
that
the
marriage
had
been
in
the
spring
,
he
started
to
plod
through
several
months
.
He
tried
to
turn
right
to
the
society
page
in
each
one
,
but
interesting
stories
kept
cropping
up
to
distract
him
.
At
last
he
found
it
in
the
paper
of
April
2
.
It
told
him
little
more
than
Mrs.
Calhoun
had
remembered
,
stating
that
it
had
been
a
small
,
modest
wedding
compared
to
some
of
the
others
.
There
was
a
marked
contrast
in
the
amount
of
information
on
bride
and
groom
.
Mr.
Black's
life
was
an
open
book
,
so
to
speak
,
from
his
birth
in
Jackson
,
Mississippi
,
through
his
basketball-playing
days
at
L.S.U.
and
his
attainment
of
a
B.A.
degree
,
which
had
presumably
prepared
him
for
his
career
as
district
sales
manager
for
Peerless
Business
Machines
.
The
one
line
on
the
bride
said
she
was
Miss
Lisa
Carmody
from
Baton
Rouge
.
No
mention
of
New
Orleans
.
Hank
was
beginning
to
feel
sharp
concern
for
Mr.
Black
.
If
Mrs.
Black
was
who
he
thought
she
was
,
Mr.
Black's
Peerless
selling
days
might
well
be
over
.
Now
for
their
exodus
from
Gulf
Springs
.
This
time
the
search
took
twice
as
long
,
cutting
down
on
his
extra
reading
,
for
he
had
to
pick
through
several
columns
of
one-
and
two-line
social
notes
in
each
issue
.
He
found
it
in
the
edition
of
May
15
.
The
item
said
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Black
had
moved
to
Jackson
,
his
home
town
--
so
the
lovely
Lisa
had
been
with
him
a
year
ago
.
Next
on
his
program
was
a
call
to
the
Jackson
office
of
Peerless
Business
Machines
to
find
out
if
Vincent
Black
was
still
with
them
--
or
,
more
specifically
,
still
with
us
.
He
glanced
at
his
watch
,
saw
it
was
only
seven
,
and
decided
to
indulge
his
weakness
now
.
For
the
next
hour
he
scrambled
happily
up
and
down
the
ladder
,
sharing
the
excitement
of
reporters
who
had
seen
McKinley's
assassination
,
the
Iroquois
Theater
fire
in
Chicago
,
and
the
Hall-Mills
trial
.
In
the
middle
of
the
stock
market
crash
,
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
outer
office
.
He
turned
around
,
saw
nothing
,
and
decided
it
must
be
a
mouse
.
Something
else
distracted
him
,
yet
there
was
no
sound
,
only
tomblike
silence
.
Then
he
knew
it
was
not
sound
,
but
lack
of
it
.
The
air
conditioner
was
no
longer
running
.
He
jumped
up
and
turned
around
to
see
the
metal
door
closing
.
It
clanged
shut
as
he
sprang
toward
it
.
He
pressed
his
face
against
the
grille
.
``
Who's
there
''
?
?
The
light
shining
through
the
grille
dimly
illumined
the
office
beyond
--
enough
for
him
to
see
there
was
no
one
there
.
Then
he
heard
the
outer
door
closing
.
``
Hey
,
come
back
''
,
he
shouted
.
He
thought
it
must
be
some
damn
janitor
or
cleaning
woman
puttering
around
,
figuring
that
Hirey
had
gone
off
and
forgotten
to
turn
off
everything
and
lock
up
.
Then
the
faint
beginnings
of
fear
stirred
in
his
mind
.
Unless
he
was
stone-blind
,
the
person
who'd
just
left
couldn't
have
missed
seeing
Hank
through
the
open
door
of
the
brightly
lighted
room
.
And
even
if
he'd
somehow
missed
seeing
him
,
he
wouldn't
have
gone
off
and
left
the
light
on
and
door
open
in
the
file
room
.
Whoever
it
was
had
meant
to
shut
him
up
in
here
,
had
followed
him
and
waited
till
the
courthouse
and
square
were
deserted
.
But
why
?
?
To
search
his
room
at
the
motel
?
?
To
come
back
later
and
kill
him
after
the
stores
had
closed
around
the
square
and
everybody
had
left
?
?
No
,
they
could
kill
him
just
as
easy
right
now
.
Nobody
could
hear
what
was
going
on
in
this
underground
vault
.
Then
he
heard
it
and
smelled
it
--
the
steady
hissing
,
the
dread
,
familiar
pungency
of
gas
escaping
.
It
must
be
coming
from
an
upright
heater
against
the
far
wall
in
the
supervisors'
office
.
Until
now
,
Lilac
Gaylor
and
Lila
Kingsley
had
been
like
an
anagram
which
he
could
unscramble
at
his
own
pace
and
choosing
.
Except
for
those
minutes
in
her
room
,
he
had
lost
touch
with
her
as
a
reality
.
Gaylor's
obsession
and
Cunningham's
chimera-chasing
reminiscences
had
mesmerized
him
into
thinking
of
Lila
and
Lilac
,
separately
or
together
,
as
a
legend
.
They
kept
drifting
apart
and
merging
again
in
his
mind
like
some
minute
form
of
life
on
a
microscope
slide
.
``
Well
''
--
said
Mr.
Skyros
.
``
I
take
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
''
.
It
was
awkward
:
very
awkward
.
There
would
be
all
the
nuisance
of
contacting
someone
else
to
take
over
.
Someone
reasonably
trustworthy
.
And
Angie
would
hear
about
it
.
And
Angie
knew
--
``
Time
''
,
said
Angie
,
and
he
smiled
very
sweet
and
slow
at
Mr.
Skyros
.
``
Not
too
much
time
,
because
I'll
be
needing
some
more
myself
pretty
much
right
away
.
And
I
done
favors
for
you
,
big
favor
not
so
long
back
,
didn't
I
,
and
I'm
right
here
to
take
on
where
Pretty
left
off
.
No
trouble
.
I
don't
want
no
trouble
,
you
don't
want
no
trouble
,
nobody
wants
trouble
,
Mr.
Skyros
''
.
Dear
heaven
,
no
,
thought
Mr.
Skyros
,
turning
away
as
another
man
came
in
.
He
straightened
his
tie
at
the
mirror
with
a
shaking
hand
;
;
the
genial
smile
seemed
painted
on
his
face
.
Angie
knew
--
Speak
of
dangerous
information
!
!
Angie
knew
too
much
entirely
already
.
Really
he
had
Mr.
Skyros
at
bay
``
Big
favor
I
done
you
.
Acourse
there's
this
deal
o'
Denny's
--
and
Jackie's
--
kinda
hangin'
fire
,
ain't
it
,
maybe
you've
been
kinda
worryin'
over
that
.
And
can't
say
I
blame
you
''
,
said
Angie
thoughtfully
.
``
This
deal
with
the
ace
o'
spades
.
Anything
to
do
with
an
ace
o'
spades
,
bad
luck
''
.
Ace
of
spades
--
a
widow
,
that
was
what
they
called
a
widow
,
these
low-class
crooks
remembered
Mr.
Skyros
distractedly
.
All
about
that
Angie
knew
,
too
.
When
things
got
a
little
out
of
hand
,
they
very
rapidly
got
a
lot
out
of
hand
--
it
seemed
to
be
a
general
rule
.
All
just
by
chance
,
and
in
a
way
tracing
back
to
poor
Frank
,
all
of
it
,
because
naturally
--
brothers
,
living
together
--
and
Angie
--
Mr.
Skyros
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
on
Angelo's
regular-featured
,
almost
girlishly
good-looking
face
--
or
indeed
anything
about
Angelo
.
Mr.
Skyros
was
not
a
man
who
thought
very
much
about
moral
principles
;
;
he
found
money
much
more
interesting
;
;
but
all
the
same
he
thought
now
,
uneasily
,
of
the
way
in
which
Angelo
earned
his
living
--
and
paid
for
his
own
stuff
--
and
eyed
the
soft
smile
,
and
the
spaniel-like
dark
eyes
,
and
he
felt
a
little
ill
.
``
Look
,
my
friend
''
,
he
said
,
``
in
my
life
I
learn
,
how
is
it
the
proverb
says
,
better
an
ounce
of
prevention
to
a
pound
of
cure
.
I
stay
in
business
so
long
because
I'm
careful
.
Two
weeks
,
a
month
,
we
talk
it
over
again
,
and
maybe
if
nothing
happens
meanwhile
to
say
the
cops
know
this
and
that
,
then
we
make
a
little
deal
,
isn't
it
''
?
?
``
That's
a
long
while
''
,
said
Angie
.
``
I
tell
you
,
you
want
to
leave
it
that
way
,
I
don't
fool
around
with
it
.
I
go
over
to
Castro
and
get
fixed
up
there
.
I
can't
wait
no
two
weeks
''
.
And
Mr.
Skyros
didn't
like
Angie
,
but
what
with
Prettyman
and
three
of
his
boys
inside
,
and
not
likely
to
come
out
--
And
Angie
such
a
valuable
salesman
,
Prettyman
said
--
All
the
nuisance
and
danger
of
getting
in
touch
with
practically
a
whole
new
bunch
of
boys
--
Why
did
everything
have
to
happen
at
once
?
?
Denny
said
stupidly
,
``
Why
,
you
ain't
turning
Angie
down
,
are
you
,
Mr.
Skyros
?
?
I
mean
,
we
all
figured
--
I
guess
anybody'd
figure
--
Angie
''
--
Angelo
gave
him
an
affectionate
smile
.
``
Mr.
Skyros
too
smart
a
fellow
want
to
get
rid
of
me
''
,
he
said
.
``
It's
O.K.
,
Denny
,
everything's
O.K.
Ain't
it
,
Mr.
Skyros
''
?
?
Oh
,
God
,
the
name
repeated
over
and
over
,
anybody
to
hear
--
Not
being
a
fool
,
Mr.
Skyros
knew
why
.
But
aside
from
everything
else
,
it
would
scarcely
be
pleasant
to
have
dealings
with
one
who
was
nominally
an
underling
and
actually
held
--
you
could
say
--
the
whip
hand
.
And
all
because
of
Domokous
!
!
If
Mr.
Skyros
had
dreamed
of
all
the
trouble
that
young
man
would
eventually
cause
--
Of
course
,
there
was
another
factor
.
Angie
worth
his
weight
in
gold
right
now
,
but
these
users
,
they
sometimes
went
down
fast
.
Who
knew
,
Angie
might
not
last
long
.
The
sweat
broke
out
on
Mr.
Skyros'
forehead
as
he
realized
he
had
been
actually
thinking
--
hoping
--
planning
--
perhaps
--
Good
God
above
,
had
not
Domokous
been
enough
?
?
He
patted
Angelo's
thin
shoulder
paternally
.
``
Now
you
don't
want
to
go
talking
that
way
''
,
he
said
.
``
Sure
,
sure
,
you're
the
one
take
over
for
Pretty
,
soon
as
I
get
the
supply
,
get
started
up
again
,
isn't
it
?
?
You
don't
need
worry
,
Angelo
.
I
tell
you
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
you
,
my
friend
,
I
sympathize
,
and
I'll
make
it
a
special
point
--
a
special
favor
--
get
in
touch
,
and
get
some
stuff
just
for
you
.
I
don't
know
if
I
can
manage
it
tonight
or
tomorrow
,
but
I'll
try
my
best
,
my
friend
.
You
see
,
you
got
to
remember
,
we
all
got
schedules
,
like
any
business
!
!
My
man
,
he
won't
be
around
a
little
while
,
he
just
fixed
me
up
with
this
stuff
they
took
out
of
the
Elite
.
It's
awkward
,
you
see
that
,
isn't
it
''
?
?
``
Well
,
that's
your
business
,
Mr.
Skyros
''
,
said
Angie
,
and
his
dreamy
eyes
moved
past
Mr.
Skyros'
shoulder
to
gaze
vaguely
out
the
ground-glass
window
.
``
I
appreciate
it
,
you
do
that
.
Sure
.
We
don't
none
of
us
want
no
trouble
.
I'm
in
a
room
over
the
Golden
Club
on
San
Pedro
,
you
just
ask
for
me
there
,
you
want
see
me
.
Or
maybe
I
call
you
--
tonight
?
?
About
nine
o'clock
,
I
call
and
see
if
you
got
any
.
A
couple
decks
for
me
,
Mr.
Skyros
--
and
ten-twelve
to
sell
,
see
,
I
like
to
have
a
little
ready
cash
''
.
``
Oh
,
now
,
I
don't
know
about
that
much
''
,
said
Mr.
Skyros
.
``
And
you
know
,
Angelo
,
Pretty
,
he
always
keeps
it
a
strict
cash
basis
,
like
they
say
''
--
``
Sure
''
,
said
Angie
.
``
Sure
,
Mr.
Skyros
.
Fifty
a
throw
,
that
the
deal
?
?
Sure
.
I
bring
you
the
cash
,
say
five
hundred
for
ten
decks
.
Never
mind
how
much
I
cut
it
,
how
much
I
get
''
,
and
he
smiled
his
sleepy
smile
again
.
``
Standard
deal
,
Mr.
Skyros
.
You
go
'n'
have
a
look
round
for
it
''
.
``
I
do
my
best
''
,
said
Mr.
Skyros
earnestly
,
``
just
for
you
,
my
friend
.
This
is
awkward
for
everybody
,
isn't
it
,
we
all
got
to
put
up
with
inconvenience
sometimes
.
But
I
do
my
best
for
you
''
.
He
got
out
of
there
in
a
hurry
,
brushing
past
another
man
in
the
door
,
mopping
his
brow
.
The
expedient
thing
--
yes
,
very
true
,
one
must
make
do
as
one
could
,
in
some
situations
.
It
could
all
be
straightened
out
later
.
Not
very
much
later
,
but
when
things
had
settled
down
a
little
.
After
this
deal
with
the
Bouvardier
woman
went
through
.
An
ace
of
spades
.
He
was
not
a
superstitious
man
,
but
he
felt
perhaps
there
was
a
little
something
in
that
,
indeed
.
He
rather
wished
he
had
never
got
into
the
business
,
and
still
--
scarcely
to
be
resisted
,
a
nice
little
profit
with
not
much
work
involved
,
easy
money
Katya
Roslev
,
who
would
be
Katharine
Ross
so
very
soon
now
,
rang
up
her
first
sale
of
the
day
and
counted
back
the
change
.
She
did
not
notice
that
the
customer
seized
her
purchase
and
turned
away
without
a
smile
or
a
word
of
thanks
.
Usually
she
marked
the
few
who
did
thank
you
,
you
didn't
get
that
kind
much
in
a
place
like
this
:
and
she
played
a
little
game
with
herself
,
seeing
how
downright
rude
she
could
act
to
the
others
,
before
they'd
take
offense
,
threaten
to
call
the
manager
.
Funny
how
seldom
they
did
:
used
to
it
,
probably
.
The
kind
who
came
into
a
cheap
store
like
this
!
!
Grab
,
snatch
,
I
saw
that
first
!
!
And
,
Here
,
I'll
take
this
,
I
was
before
her
,
you
wait
on
me
now
or
I
don't
bother
with
it
,
see
!
!
This
kind
of
place
She'd
be
through
here
,
just
no
time
at
all
--
leave
this
kind
of
thing
'way
behind
.
Off
at
noon
,
and
she'd
never
come
back
.
Never
have
to
.
Money
--
a
lot
of
money
,
enough
.
She'd
be
smart
about
it
,
get
him
to
give
it
to
her
in
little
bills
so's
nobody
would
suspect
--
maybe
couldn't
get
it
until
Monday
account
of
that
,
the
banks
--
But
that
wasn't
really
long
to
wait
.
Not
when
she'd
waited
so
long
already
.
No
need
say
anything
at
all
to
the
old
woman
.
She
had
it
all
planned
out
,
how
she'd
do
.
She'd
say
she
didn't
feel
good
on
Sunday
,
couldn't
go
to
church
--
there'd
be
a
little
argument
,
but
she
could
be
stubborn
--
and
when
the
old
woman
had
gone
,
quick
pack
the
things
she'd
need
to
take
,
all
but
the
dress
she'd
wear
Monday
,
and
take
the
bag
down
to
that
place
in
the
station
where
you
could
put
things
in
a
locker
overnight
,
for
a
dime
.
Then
on
Monday
morning
--
or
it
might
have
to
be
Tuesday
--
get
up
and
leave
just
the
usual
time
,
and
last
thing
,
put
the
money
in
an
envelope
under
the
old
woman's
purse
there
in
the
drawer
.
She
wouldn't
be
going
to
get
that
for
an
hour
or
so
after
Katya
had
left
,
go
do
the
daily
shopping
.
No
need
leave
a
note
with
it
,
either
--
or
maybe
just
something
like
,
Don't
worry
about
me
,
I'm
going
away
to
make
a
better
life
.
A
better
life
.
Escape
.
It
wasn't
as
if
she
wanted
much
.
She
didn't
mind
working
hard
,
not
as
if
she
figured
to
do
anything
wrong
to
live
easy
and
soft
--
all
she
wanted
was
a
chance
,
where
she
wasn't
marked
as
what
she
was
.
To
be
Katharine
Ross
,
and
work
in
a
nicer
shop
somewhere
,
at
a
little
more
money
so
she
could
have
prettier
clothes
,
and
learn
ladies'
manners
and
all
like
that
,
and
get
to
know
different
people
than
up
to
now
,
not
just
the
ones
like
her
here
,
with
foreign-sounding
names
,
the
ones
went
to
the
same
church
and
--
Different
place
,
different
job
,
different
people
,
she'd
be
all
different
too
.
Prettier
,
she'd
do
her
hair
another
way
;
;
smarter
,
and
wear
different
kinds
of
clothes
--
she'd
be
Katharine
Ross
,
just
what
that
sounded
like
.
``
You've
give
me
the
wrong
change
''
,
said
the
customer
sharply
.
``
Think
I
can't
count
''
?
?
Katya
made
up
the
amount
in
indifferent
silence
.
She
was
listening
to
other
voices
,
out
of
the
future
.
Some
of
those
vaguely-imagined
new
,
different
people
.
Oh
,
Katharine's
awfully
nice
,
and
pretty
too
,
I
like
Katharine
--
Let's
ask
Katharine
to
go
with
us
,
she's
always
lots
of
fun
--
Katharine
--
Soon
,
very
soon
now
sixteen
Mendoza
didn't
wake
until
nearly
nine-thirty
.
It
was
going
to
be
another
hot
day
;
;
already
the
thermometer
stood
close
to
ninety
.
Alison
was
still
sound
asleep
;
;
he
made
fresh
coffee
and
searched
through
all
the
desk
drawers
for
more
cigarettes
before
thinking
of
her
handbag
,
and
found
a
crumpled
stray
cigarette
at
its
bottom
,
which
tasted
peculiarly
of
face
powder
.
He
left
a
note
propped
on
the
desk
asking
her
to
call
him
sometime
today
,
and
drove
home
.
After
he'd
got
out
fresh
liver
for
Bast
,
he
paused
to
look
at
her
crouched
daintily
over
her
dish
.
Surely
she
was
just
a
trifle
fatter
around
the
middle
?
?
He
seemed
to
remember
reading
somewhere
that
Abyssinians
had
large
litters
,
and
suffered
a
dismaying
vision
of
the
apartment
overrun
with
a
dozen
kittens
.
``
Y
que
sigue
despues
?
?
--
What
then
''
?
?
He
asked
her
severely
.
``
A
lot
of
people
are
so
peculiar
that
they
don't
like
cats
,
it's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
good
homes
for
kittens
--
and
,
damn
it
,
you
know
very
well
if
I
have
them
around
long
,
impossible
to
give
them
away
!
!
And
I
suppose
now
that
you've
finally
grown
up
,
if
a
little
late
,
you'd
go
on
producing
kittens
every
six
months
or
so
.
Yes
,
well
,
it's
a
pity
to
spoil
your
girlish
figure
--
which
all
those
kittens
would
do
anyway
--
but
I
think
when
you've
raised
these
we'll
just
have
the
vet
fix
it
so
there
won't
be
any
more
.
I
wonder
if
the
Carters
would
take
one
.
And
it's
no
good
looking
at
me
like
that
''
,
as
she
wound
affectionately
around
his
ankles
.
Maude's
long
nose
unexpectedly
wrinkled
up
.
``
Happened
to
be
in
the
hall
!
!
Happened
to
hear
you
quarrel
about
her
!
!
Oh
,
well
,
you
can't
really
blame
Lolotte
.
She
lost
her
beau
to
you
''
.
But
she
was
talking
of
Emile
when
she
saw
the
black
line
of
the
open
door
;
;
Sarah
remembered
it
clearly
.
Maude
went
on
.
``
I've
got
to
get
busy
.
Miss
Celie's
taken
to
her
bed
,
with
the
door
locked
.
She
opened
it
an
inch
and
poked
out
the
keys
for
me
to
give
you
.
Here
''
--
She
thrust
a
bundle
of
keys
strung
on
a
thick
red
cord
into
Sarah's
hand
.
``
Not
that
there's
much
use
in
locking
up
the
smokehouse
and
the
storehouse
now
.
Drink
your
coffee
''
--
coffee
.
``
It's
--
cold
''
.
Maude
suddenly
looked
quite
capable
of
pouring
it
down
her
throat
.
``
I
don't
want
it
''
,
Sarah
said
,
firmly
.
``
Oh
.
Well
--
I'll
take
it
down
with
me
as
I
go
''
.
Maude
swooped
up
the
cup
and
hiked
up
her
top
hoop
as
if
about
to
take
off
with
a
racing
start
.
At
the
door
she
turned
back
,
her
Roman
nose
looking
very
long
now
and
satiric
.
``
I
forgot
.
Ben
and
Lucien
have
gone
after
them
.
It's
just
like
that
book
your
Northern
friend
wrote
--
except
there
aren't
any
ice
floes
to
cross
and
no
bloodhounds
''
.
``
I
don't
know
Mrs.
Stowe
.
What
can
they
do
if
they
find
them
''
?
?
``
They
can't
do
anything
.
It's
silly
,
childish
,
running
after
them
like
that
.
I
told
Ben
so
.
But
of
course
the
paterollers
won't
be
of
any
help
,
not
with
everything
so
upset
and
that
Yankee
cavalry
outfit
they
say
is
running
around
,
God
knows
where
''
.
She
had
swished
away
,
she
had
been
gone
for
a
long
time
probably
when
Sarah
suddenly
realized
that
she
ought
to
stop
her
,
pour
out
the
coffee
,
so
no
one
would
drink
it
.
But
then
the
so-called
coffee
was
bad
enough
at
best
,
cold
it
was
all
but
undrinkable
--
especially
that
cup
!
!
She
was
deeply
,
horribly
sure
that
Lucien
had
filled
it
with
opium
.
She
had
quarreled
with
Lucien
,
she
had
resisted
his
demands
for
money
--
and
if
she
died
,
by
the
provisions
of
her
marriage
contract
,
Lucien
would
inherit
legally
not
only
the
immediate
sum
of
gold
under
the
floorboards
in
the
office
,
but
later
,
when
the
war
was
over
,
her
father's
entire
estate
.
She
felt
cold
and
hot
,
sticky
and
chilly
at
the
same
time
.
Now
wait
a
minute
,
she
told
herself
,
think
about
it
;
;
Lucien
is
not
the
only
person
in
this
house
who
could
have
put
opium
in
that
coffee
.
She
had
lost
a
bottle
of
opium
--
but
that
was
on
the
trip
from
New
Orleans
.
Or
someone
had
taken
it
during
her
first
day
at
Honotassa
.
Yes
,
she
had
missed
it
after
her
talk
with
Emile
,
after
dinner
,
just
before
Emile
was
shot
.
Rilly
or
Glendora
had
entered
her
room
while
she
slept
,
bringing
back
her
washed
clothes
.
So
somebody
else
could
have
come
in
,
too
--
then
or
later
while
she
was
out
of
the
room
.
It
would
have
been
easy
to
identify
as
opium
by
its
odor
.
It
was
not
very
reasonable
to
believe
that
Lucien
had
procured
unprocurable
opium
and
come
back
to
Honotassa
with
a
formed
plan
to
murder
her
.
He
didn't
even
know
that
she
was
there
.
And
he
certainly
couldn't
have
guessed
that
she
would
resist
his
demand
for
the
gold
or
that
she
was
not
the
yielding
--
yes
,
and
credible
fool
he
had
every
right
to
expect
.
No
,
he
had
been
surprised
,
unpleasantly
surprised
,
but
surprised
.
Then
somebody
else
?
?
Don't
question
,
Rev
had
said
,
don't
invite
danger
.
Her
skin
crawled
:
Lolotte
had
told
Maude
that
she
was
in
the
hall
and
the
door
was
open
.
Sarah
had
begun
to
tell
Lucien
of
Emile
,
she
had
begun
to
question
and
a
little
draft
had
crept
across
the
room
from
the
bedroom
door
,
open
barely
enough
to
show
a
rim
of
blackness
in
the
hall
.
So
Lolotte
--
or
anybody
--
could
have
listened
,
and
that
somebody
could
have
already
been
supplied
with
the
missing
bottle
of
opium
.
That
was
not
reasonable
either
.
The
opium
had
disappeared
before
Emile's
death
and
whoever
shot
him
could
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
have
foreseen
Sarah's
own
doubts
and
suspicions
--
and
questions
.
She
began
to
doubt
whether
there
had
been
in
fact
a
lethal
dose
of
opium
in
the
cup
.
So
suppose
somebody
only
wished
to
frighten
her
,
so
she
would
leave
Honotassa
!
!
That
made
a
certain
amount
of
logic
.
Added
to
the
argument
was
the
fact
that
while
she
might
have
tasted
the
coffee
if
it
had
been
still
hot
,
she
might
even
have
drunk
some
of
it
,
she
wouldn't
have
taken
enough
to
kill
her
,
for
she
would
have
been
warned
by
its
taste
.
No
.
It
was
merely
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
.
She
wouldn't
go
back
to
New
York
as
Maude
suggested
;
;
she
wouldn't
run
like
a
scared
cat
.
But
--
well
,
she'd
be
very
careful
.
She
dressed
and
the
accustomed
routine
restored
to
her
a
sense
of
normal
everyday
life
.
But
before
she
left
her
room
she
dug
into
her
big
moire
bag
,
took
out
the
envelope
holding
her
marriage
contract
and
the
wax
seal
had
been
broken
.
So
somebody
else
knew
what
would
happen
to
her
father's
money
if
she
died
.
Rev
had
known
all
along
.
Rev
didn't
need
to
break
the
wax
seal
,
read
the
contract
and
find
out
.
He
could
conceivably
have
wished
to
make
sure
;
;
Rev
loved
Honotassa
,
it
was
like
a
part
of
his
breath
and
body
;
;
Rev
had
stressed
the
need
for
money
.
Rev
would
never
have
tried
to
give
her
poison
!
!
She
thrust
the
envelope
back
in
the
bag
;
;
there
was
no
point
in
locking
it
up
in
the
armoire
now
,
it
was
like
locking
the
barn
after
the
horse
was
stolen
.
And
in
all
likelihood
,
by
now
,
there
was
more
than
one
person
in
the
house
who
knew
the
terms
of
her
marriage
contract
.
There
was
no
point
either
in
telling
herself
again
what
a
fool
she'd
been
.
She
went
downstairs
and
received
another
curious
shock
,
for
when
Glendora
flapped
into
the
dining
room
in
her
homemade
moccasins
,
Sarah
asked
her
when
she
had
brought
coffee
to
her
room
and
Glendora
said
she
hadn't
.
``
Too
much
work
this
morning
,
Miss
Sarah
--
everybody
gone
like
that
''
--
Sarah
swallowed
past
another
kind
of
constriction
in
her
throat
.
``
Well
,
then
who
brought
it
''
?
?
``
Miss
Maude
.
She
come
to
the
kitchen
and
say
she
take
it
up
to
you
''
.
Glendora
put
down
a
dish
of
lukewarm
rice
.
``
Not
much
breakfast
this
morning
.
I
don't
know
what
we're
going
to
do
,
Miss
Sarah
''
.
``
We've
got
to
eat
''
,
Sarah
said
,
curtly
,
because
a
chill
crawled
over
her
again
.
Maude
?
?
Glendora
flapped
away
.
The
rice
wasn't
dosed
with
opium
,
indeed
it
had
no
taste
at
all
,
not
a
grain
of
salt
.
She
ate
what
she
could
and
went
out
along
the
covered
passageway
,
with
the
rain
dripping
from
the
vines
.
In
the
kitchen
Glendora
was
despairingly
picking
chickens
.
``
Get
a
basket
''
,
Sarah
told
her
.
``
We'll
go
to
the
storehouse
''
.
Glendora
dropped
a
chicken
and
a
flurry
of
feathers
,
and
went
with
her
through
the
drizzle
,
to
the
storehouse
.
Sarah
found
the
right
key
and
unlocked
the
door
.
It
was
a
long
,
low
room
,
like
a
root
cellar
,
for
it
was
banked
up
with
soil
,
and
vines
had
run
rampant
over
that
,
too
.
It
was
dark
but
dry
and
cool
.
She
doled
out
what
Glendora
vaguely
guessed
were
the
right
amounts
of
dried
peas
,
eggs
,
cornmeal
,
a
little
salt
.
The
shelves
looked
emptier
than
when
Miss
Celie
had
shown
her
the
storeroom
,
and
since
the
men
from
the
Commissary
had
called
;
;
there
were
certainly
now
fewer
mouths
to
feed
but
there
was
less
to
feed
them
with
.
She
took
Glendora
to
the
smokehouse
,
unlocked
it
and
saw
with
satisfaction
there
was
still
a
quantity
of
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
,
hanging
from
the
smoke-stained
rafters
.
They
wouldn't
go
hungry
,
not
yet
.
And
the
fields
were
green
and
growing
.
``
Can't
you
possibly
imagine
what
life
is
going
to
be
like
,
here
''
?
?
Maude
had
said
.
Maude
.
She
sent
Glendora
back
to
the
house
,
her
basket
and
her
apron
laden
.
She
stood
for
a
moment
,
rain
dripping
from
the
trees
over
her
head
,
thinking
of
Maude
.
Maude
had
the
opportunity
to
take
the
bottle
of
opium
from
Sarah's
room
.
Maude
had
the
cool
ruthlessness
to
do
whatever
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
.
She
couldn't
see
how
her
death
could
affect
Maude
.
She
couldn't
see
any
reason
why
Maude
would
attempt
to
frighten
her
.
Besides
,
there
was
something
hysterical
and
silly
,
something
almost
childish
about
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
.
Maude
was
neither
hysterical
nor
silly
and
Sarah
rather
doubted
if
she
had
ever
been
childish
.
Yet
Maude
had
suggested
that
Sarah
return
to
New
York
.
Maude
could
have
shot
Emile
--
if
she'd
had
a
reason
to
kill
him
.
There
was
no
use
in
standing
there
in
the
drizzle
,
trying
to
find
a
link
between
Emile's
murder
and
opium
in
a
cup
of
coffee
.
She
started
back
for
the
house
,
saw
a
light
in
the
office
,
opened
the
door
and
surprised
a
domestic
little
scene
which
was
far
outside
the
dark
realm
of
murder
or
attempted
murder
.
Rev
,
George
and
Lolotte
were
mending
shoes
.
A
lighted
lamp
stood
on
the
table
that
dusky
,
drizzling
day
.
They
were
all
three
bent
over
a
shabby
riding
boot
;
;
George
had
a
tack
hammer
.
Lolotte
held
a
patch
of
leather
,
Rev
steadied
something
,
a
tiny
brad
,
waiting
for
George's
poised
hammer
.
George
said
,
``
First
thing
I
do
when
I
get
to
Vicksburg
again
,
is
get
me
a
Yankee
''
--
``
With
boots
on
''
,
Lolotte
laughed
softly
.
Rev
looked
up
and
saw
her
.
Lolotte
looked
up
and
stiffened
.
George
didn't
look
up
at
all
.
There
was
no
way
to
know
,
no
way
to
guess
whether
any
one
of
them
was
surprised
at
Sarah's
appearance
,
believing
her
to
be
drugged
and
senseless
--
and
just
possibly
dead
.
Rev
said
,
``
Come
in
,
Sarah
.
Reckon
you
know
the
news
''
.
And
what
news
,
Sarah
thought
as
satirically
as
Maude
might
have
said
it
.
Rev's
face
was
suddenly
a
little
fixed
and
questioning
.
He
turned
to
George
and
Lolotte
.
``
Take
your
cobbler's
shop
somewhere
else
.
I
want
to
talk
to
Sarah
''
.
Everything
in
the
office
,
the
spreading
circle
of
lamplight
,
the
patch
of
leather
in
Lolotte's
hands
.
George
poised
with
the
tack
hammer
,
the
homely
,
everyday
atmosphere
,
all
denied
an
attempt
at
murder
.
A
rush
of
panic
caught
Sarah
.
``
No
.
Not
now
.
I
mean
I've
got
to
--
to
see
to
the
kitchen
.
Glendora
''
--
Her
words
jumbled
together
and
she
all
but
ran
from
the
office
and
from
the
question
in
Rev's
face
.
Now
why
did
I
do
that
?
?
She
thought
as
warm
,
drizzling
rain
touched
her
face
.
She
was
no
schoolgirl
,
refusing
to
bear
tales
.
As
she
reached
the
kitchen
door
the
answer
presented
itself
;
;
if
she
told
anyone
of
the
opium
it
must
be
Lucien
,
her
husband
.
It
might
be
,
indeed
it
had
already
proved
to
be
a
marriage
without
love
,
but
it
was
marriage
.
So
she
couldn't
choose
Rev
as
a
confidant
;
;
it
must
be
Lucien
.
Always
provided
that
Lucien
himself
had
not
dosed
her
coffee
with
opium
,
she
thought
,
as
coldly
and
sharply
,
again
,
as
Maude
might
have
said
it
.
She
paused
at
the
kitchen
door
,
caught
her
breath
,
told
herself
firmly
that
the
opium
was
only
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
and
went
into
the
kitchen
,
where
Glendora
was
eyeing
the
chickens
dismally
and
Maude
was
cleaning
lamp
chimneys
.
Glendora
gave
a
gulp
.
``
Miss
Sarah
,
I
can't
cut
up
no
chicken
.
Miss
Maude
say
she
won't
''
.
Again
the
homely
,
everyday
details
of
daily
living
refuted
a
vicious
attempt
to
frighten
her
--
or
to
murder
her
.
The
homely
everyday
details
of
living
and
domestic
requirements
also
pressed
upon
her
with
their
immediate
urgency
.
No
matter
what
had
happened
or
hadn't
happened
,
somebody
had
to
see
about
dinner
.
She
eyed
the
chickens
with
,
if
she
had
known
it
,
something
of
Glendora's
dismal
look
and
thought
with
a
certain
fury
of
the
time
she
had
spent
on
Latin
verbs
.
``
Not
since
last
night
.
I
didn't
think
there
was
any
reason
to
''
.
``
Maybe
there
isn't
.
Speak
to
him
again
anyway
.
Try
talking
to
some
of
the
fellows
he
works
with
,
friends
,
anyone
.
Try
to
find
out
how
happy
he
is
with
his
wife
,
whether
he
plays
around
with
women
.
You
might
try
looking
into
his
wife
too
.
She
might
have
been
talking
to
some
of
her
friends
about
her
husband
if
they've
been
having
any
trouble
''
.
``
You
think
Black's
the
one
we're
looking
for
''
?
?
``
Yeah
.
I
think
he
might
be
''
,
Conrad
said
grimly
.
``
Then
again
he
might
not
''
.
``
What
a
stinking
world
''
,
Rourke
said
.
``
Black
is
Gilborn's
best
friend
''
.
``
I
know
''
.
``
Will
you
be
coming
back
soon
''
?
?
``
I
think
so
.
I'm
on
my
way
to
see
the
Jacobs
woman
''
.
``
Gilborn's
secretary
?
?
What
for
?
?
You
don't
think
Gilborn
is
the
--
''
?
?
``
I
don't
think
anything
.
I
just
don't
want
to
go
off
half-cocked
before
picking
up
Black
,
that's
all
''
.
Conrad
interrupted
.
``
Gilborn
says
he
was
in
his
office
all
day
with
her
yesterday
.
I'd
like
to
make
sure
.
Also
,
it's
just
possible
she
might
know
something
about
Mrs.
Gilborn
''
.
``
Right
.
I'll
see
you
later
''
.
``
Aren't
you
ever
going
to
go
home
''
?
?
``
It
sure
as
hell
doesn't
look
like
it
,
does
it
?
?
I'm
telling
you
,
if
these
corpses
ever
knew
the
trouble
they
put
us
to
,
they'd
think
twice
before
letting
themselves
get
knocked
off
''
.
``
Remember
to
tell
that
to
the
next
corpse
you
meet
''
.
Conrad
hung
up
and
sat
on
the
small
telephone-booth
bench
,
massaging
his
right
leg
.
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
It
was
ten
minutes
before
eleven
.
He
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
had
a
signed
confession
from
Lionel
Black
.
Thirty
years'
experience
let
him
know
,
even
at
this
early
stage
,
that
Black
was
his
man
.
But
he
still
wanted
to
know
why
.
It
was
a
cold
,
windy
day
,
the
day
after
Kitti's
death
,
but
Stanley
Gilborn
paid
no
attention
to
the
blustery
October
wind
.
After
leaving
Conrad
,
Gilborn
had
no
destination
.
He
simply
walked
,
not
noticing
where
he
was
,
not
caring
.
He
stopped
automatically
at
the
street
corners
,
waiting
for
the
traffic
lights
to
change
,
unheeding
of
other
people
,
his
coat
open
and
flapping
.
As
he
walked
,
he
tried
to
think
.
Of
Kitti
.
Of
himself
.
Mainly
of
what
Conrad
had
tried
to
make
him
believe
.
There
was
nothing
coherent
about
his
thinking
.
It
was
a
succession
of
picture-images
passing
through
his
mind
:
the
same
ones
,
different
ones
,
in
no
apparent
sequence
,
in
no
logical
succession
.
The
enormity
of
what
Conrad
had
told
him
made
it
impossible
for
Gilborn
to
accept
,
with
any
degree
of
realism
,
the
actuality
of
it
.
Conrad's
words
had
intellectual
meaning
for
him
only
.
Emotionally
,
they
penetrated
him
not
at
all
.
Whoever
he
was
and
your
wife
were
intimate
.
Gilborn
remembered
Conrad's
exact
words
.
They
made
sense
and
yet
they
didn't
.
He
knew
Conrad
had
told
him
the
truth
.
It
was
so
.
Yet
it
wasn't
so
.
It
wasn't
so
because
it
couldn't
be
so
.
When
Kitti
was
alive
--
and
he
remembered
the
pressure
of
her
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
arm
--
she
had
been
the
center
of
his
life
.
She
was
the
sun
,
he
the
closest
planet
orbiting
around
her
,
the
rest
of
the
world
existing
and
visible
yet
removed
.
For
fifty-five
years
he
had
lived
,
progressing
towards
a
no-goal
,
eating
,
working
,
breathing
without
plan
,
without
reason
.
Kitti
had
come
along
to
justify
everything
.
She
was
his
goal
,
she
was
his
reason
.
He
had
lived
all
his
life
waiting
for
her
.
Not
once
,
in
the
time
that
he
had
known
her
,
had
he
ever
considered
the
possibility
,
not
once
,
not
for
one
one-thousandth
of
a
second
,
of
her
infidelity
.
He
could
not
consider
it
now
.
Not
really
.
And
so
he
walked
,
aimless
again
.
The
walk
ended
,
inevitably
,
right
in
front
of
his
hotel
building
.
The
doorman
began
to
nod
his
head
automatically
,
then
remembered
who
Gilborn
was
,
what
had
happened
to
him
the
night
before
.
He
looked
at
Gilborn
with
undisguised
curiosity
.
Gilborn
passed
by
him
without
seeing
him
.
He
crossed
the
lobby
and
rode
up
in
the
elevator
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
.
In
the
apartment
itself
,
all
was
still
.
The
police
were
no
longer
there
.
There
was
no
evidence
that
anything
was
different
than
it
had
been
.
Except
that
Kitti
wasn't
there
.
Without
taking
off
his
coat
,
he
sat
in
the
blue
chair
which
still
faced
the
closed
bedroom
door
.
At
last
,
sitting
there
,
in
the
familiar
surroundings
,
the
truth
began
to
sink
in
.
Who
?
?
He
felt
no
anger
towards
Kitti
,
no
sense
that
she
had
betrayed
him
.
Who
?
?
She
was
all
he
had
,
everything
he
had
,
everything
he
wanted
.
Someone
had
taken
her
away
from
him
.
Who
?
?
Where
there
is
a
left-hand
entry
in
the
ledger
,
there
is
a
right-hand
one
,
he
remembered
from
his
school
days
.
Where
there
is
a
victim
,
there
is
a
killer
.
Who
?
?
Whoever
he
was
and
your
wife
were
intimate
.
He
rose
from
the
chair
,
took
off
his
coat
.
Quickly
,
he
went
into
the
bedroom
.
The
bed
still
showed
signs
of
where
Kitti
had
lain
.
Gilborn
stood
there
for
a
long
time
.
He
looked
at
the
bed
unblinkingly
.
The
bed
was
empty
now
.
Kitti
would
lie
in
it
no
more
.
He
would
lie
in
it
no
more
.
Gilborn
wondered
whether
Kitti
had
lain
in
that
same
bed
with
Who
?
?
For
thirty
minutes
,
Stanley
Gilborn
stood
there
.
At
the
end
of
the
half-hour
,
racking
his
brains
,
thinking
over
and
over
again
of
Kitti
,
her
friends
,
her
past
,
he
left
the
bedroom
.
Who
?
?
He
could
think
of
no
answer
.
Gilborn
put
on
his
coat
again
.
Before
leaving
,
he
took
one
last
,
lingering
look
at
the
apartment
.
He
knew
he
would
never
see
it
again
.
In
the
street
,
walking
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
Stanley
Gilborn
was
a
lone
figure
.
On
Blanche
Jacobs
,
Kitti
Gilborn's
death
had
a
quite
different
effect
.
For
Blanche
,
Kitti's
death
was
a
source
of
guilty
,
but
nonetheless
soaring
,
happy
hope
.
In
Blanche's
defense
,
it
must
be
said
she
was
unaware
of
the
newborn
hope
.
If
anyone
had
asked
her
,
she
would
have
described
herself
only
as
nervous
and
worried
.
The
figures
on
the
worksheet
paper
in
front
of
her
were
jumping
and
waving
around
so
badly
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
make
them
out
clearly
enough
to
copy
them
with
the
typewriter
.
She
wondered
whether
Stanley
would
call
.
She
wanted
to
be
with
him
,
to
give
him
the
comfort
and
companionship
she
knew
he
needed
.
She
had
skipped
her
lunch
hour
in
the
fear
that
he
might
call
while
she
was
out
.
He
hadn't
.
And
now
she
was
feeling
sick
,
both
from
concern
about
Stanley
and
hunger
.
Why
hadn't
he
called
?
?
Men
,
she
reflected
,
even
men
like
Stanley
,
are
unpredictable
.
She
tried
to
think
of
his
unpredictable
actions
in
the
eleven
years
she
had
known
him
and
discovered
they
weren't
so
many
after
all
.
Stanley
really
was
quite
predictable
.
That
was
one
of
the
things
she
liked
about
Stanley
.
He
wasn't
like
so
many
other
men
.
The
dentist
last
night
,
for
instance
.
Dinner
and
the
movies
had
been
fine
.
He
had
taken
her
upstairs
to
say
good
night
.
She
had
invited
him
in
for
coffee
.
It
was
in
the
kitchen
,
as
she
was
watching
the
kettle
,
waiting
for
the
water
to
boil
,
that
he
had
grabbed
for
her
.
Without
warning
,
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
prepare
for
it
.
From
behind
,
he
had
put
his
arms
on
her
shoulders
,
turned
her
around
,
and
pressed
her
to
him
,
so
close
she
couldn't
breathe
.
Later
,
she
apologized
for
the
long
scratch
across
his
face
,
tried
to
explain
she
couldn't
help
herself
,
that
the
panic
arose
in
her
unwanted
.
But
he
hadn't
understood
.
When
he
left
,
she
knew
she
would
never
see
him
again
.
Stanley
wasn't
like
that
.
She
could
always
predict
what
Stanley
was
going
to
do
,
ever
since
she
first
met
him
.
Except
for
that
one
morning
.
The
morning
he
walked
in
to
announce
to
her
,
blushing
,
that
he
was
married
.
She
thought
she
was
going
to
die
.
She
had
assumed
before
then
that
one
day
he
would
ask
her
to
marry
him
.
Blanche
couldn't
remember
when
she
had
first
arrived
at
this
conclusion
.
She
thought
it
was
sometime
during
the
second
week
she
worked
for
Stanley
.
It
was
nothing
that
he
said
or
did
,
but
it
seemed
so
natural
to
her
that
she
should
be
working
for
him
,
looking
forward
to
his
eventual
proposal
.
She
was
thirty-one
years
old
then
.
Her
mother
was
already
considerably
concerned
over
her
daughter's
future
.
But
Blanche
had
been
able
to
maintain
a
serene
and
assured
composure
in
the
face
of
her
widowed
mother's
continued
carping
,
had
been
able
to
resist
her
urgings
to
date
anyone
who
offered
the
slightest
possibility
of
matrimony
.
For
Blanche
,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
Stanley
would
propose
.
It
was
to
be
expected
that
Stanley
would
be
shy
,
slow
in
taking
such
a
momentous
step
.
Stanley
went
along
in
life
,
she
knew
,
convinced
that
he
deserved
the
love
and
faith
of
no
woman
.
As
a
result
,
he
never
looked
for
it
.
But
one
day
,
she
expected
,
he
would
somehow
discover
,
without
her
having
to
tell
him
,
that
there
was
such
a
woman
in
the
world
;
;
a
woman
who
was
willing
to
give
him
love
,
faith
,
and
anything
else
a
woman
could
give
a
husband
.
Indeed
,
there
was
a
woman
who
,
unasked
,
had
already
given
him
love
.
Unquestionably
,
Blanche
loved
Stanley
.
And
then
,
unexpectedly
,
Stanley
made
his
announcement
.
On
that
first
day
,
Blanche
literally
thought
she
was
going
to
die
,
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
go
out
of
her
mind
.
It
might
have
been
easier
for
her
if
Kitti
Walker
hadn't
been
everything
that
Blanche
was
not
.
Kitti
was
thirty
years
younger
than
Stanley
,
taller
than
Stanley
,
prettier
than
Stanley
had
any
right
to
hope
for
,
much
less
expect
.
Kitti
could
have
married
a
score
of
men
.
There
was
no
reason
for
her
to
marry
someone
like
Stanley
Gilborn
,
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
marry
Stanley
.
Kitti
had
come
into
the
office
,
on
somebody's
recommendation
,
because
she
needed
help
in
preparing
her
income
tax
return
.
Stanley
had
filled
out
the
return
and
because
,
when
he
was
finished
,
it
was
close
to
the
lunch
hour
,
he
had
politely
asked
Kitti
to
join
him
,
never
expecting
her
to
accept
.
Blanche
knew
all
this
because
the
door
to
Stanley's
office
was
open
and
,
without
straining
too
hard
,
she
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
.
Stanley
had
gone
out
,
saying
he
would
be
back
in
an
hour
.
He
hadn't
come
back
for
over
two
.
After
that
day
,
Blanche
still
didn't
know
exactly
what
had
happened
.
There
were
mornings
when
Stanley
came
in
late
,
afternoons
when
he
left
early
,
days
when
he
didn't
come
in
at
all
.
Blanche
knew
something
must
be
causing
Stanley's
new
,
strange
behavior
but
she
never
once
connected
it
with
Kitti
Walker
.
It
was
too
unprecedented
.
Then
,
six
weeks
after
the
day
Kitti
first
came
into
the
office
,
Stanley
announced
he
and
Kitti
were
married
.
Somehow
,
Blanche
managed
to
cover
the
stunned
surprise
and
offer
her
congratulations
.
That
night
the
two
of
them
left
for
a
week's
honeymoon
in
Acapulco
.
While
they
were
away
Blanche
came
into
the
office
every
morning
,
running
things
as
she
had
always
run
them
for
Stanley
,
going
through
the
week
in
a
dazed
stupor
,
getting
things
done
automatically
,
out
of
habit
.
For
exactly
one
week
,
she
was
able
to
continue
in
this
manner
.
On
the
morning
of
Stanley's
return
,
however
,
her
strength
left
her
.
Two
hours
of
watching
his
serenely
happy
face
,
listening
to
his
soft
humming
as
he
bent
over
his
penciled
figures
,
and
Blanche
had
to
leave
.
She
stayed
away
for
ten
days
.
Those
ten
days
were
like
no
others
that
Blanche
had
known
.
Mostly
,
she
stayed
in
bed
.
She
didn't
tell
anyone
,
even
her
mother
,
what
was
wrong
.
She
refused
to
have
a
doctor
,
insisting
there
was
nothing
a
doctor
could
do
for
her
.
``
Right
''
,
said
the
fingerprint
man
.
``
Also
,
if
you're
going
to
believe
those
prints
,
you'll
have
to
look
for
a
killer
who's
a
top-grade
piano
player
''
.
He
demonstrated
by
playing
an
imaginary
piano
,
doing
a
staccato
passage
with
a
broadly
exaggerated
attack
.
To
make
it
clearer
he
shifted
to
acting
out
,
but
with
no
change
of
manner
,
the
killing
of
Rose
Mallory
.
His
hands
snatched
at
an
imaginary
bucket
,
swooping
down
hard
to
grab
it
and
coming
away
with
equal
snap
like
a
ball
that's
been
bounced
hard
.
In
the
same
way
he
pantomimed
grasping
a
mantel
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
,
pressing
his
hands
against
the
floor
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
.
He
was
moving
like
a
ballet
dancer
,
playing
for
laughs
.
If
Rose
Mallory's
killer
acted
this
way
,
catching
up
with
him
was
going
to
be
a
cinch
.
We'd
know
him
by
his
stretch
pants
and
the
flowers
he'd
wear
twined
in
his
hair
.
Perhaps
if
Felix
had
first
come
upon
us
when
this
boy
was
not
cavorting
so
gaily
up
and
down
the
hall
outside
the
murdered
woman's
apartment
,
we
might
have
had
less
trouble
convincing
Felix
of
our
seriousness
.
This
,
you
will
remember
,
was
still
New
Year's
Day
.
By
the
time
Felix
turned
up
it
was
early
afternoon
,
which
,
one
would
think
,
would
be
late
enough
so
that
by
then
,
except
for
small
children
and
a
few
hardy
souls
who
had
not
yet
sobered
up
,
it
could
have
been
expected
that
people
would
no
longer
be
having
any
sort
of
active
interest
in
the
previous
night's
noisemakers
and
paper
hats
.
Felix
was
the
exception
.
He
had
retained
his
hat
and
his
horn
,
and
,
whatever
fun
might
still
be
going
,
he
was
ready
to
join
it
.
That
,
incidentally
,
might
give
you
some
idea
of
what
Felix
was
like
.
After
all
,
he
hadn't
happened
upon
us
in
that
second-floor
hall
without
warning
.
The
M.E.'s
boys
had
finished
their
on-the-spot
examination
and
the
body
had
been
removed
for
autopsy
.
The
meat
wagon
,
therefore
,
was
not
out
in
front
of
the
house
any
more
,
but
the
cluster
of
squad
cars
was
still
there
and
there
was
a
cop
on
the
door
downstairs
to
screen
any
comings
and
goings
.
There
was
,
furthermore
,
the
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
gathered
in
the
street
and
a
couple
more
cops
to
hold
them
at
a
decent
distance
.
Just
put
yourself
in
Felix's
place
for
a
moment
.
You're
a
taxpayer
,
householder
,
landlord
.
You've
been
away
from
home
for
the
New
Year
festivities
,
but
now
the
party
is
over
and
you
come
home
.
Defining
sobriety
in
the
limited
sense
of
being
free
from
the
clinical
symptoms
of
the
effects
of
alcohol
ingested
and
not
yet
eliminated
from
the
system
,
you
are
sober
.
You
still
have
your
paper
hat
and
you're
wearing
it
,
but
then
,
it
is
an
extraordinary
paper
hat
and
,
in
addition
to
anything
else
you
may
be
,
you
are
also
the
sculptor
who
created
that
most
peculiar
dame
out
in
the
back
yard
.
It's
not
too
much
to
assume
that
you
will
have
a
more
lasting
interest
in
paper
hats
than
will
Mr.
Average
Citizen
.
You
have
your
paper
horn
clutched
in
your
big
,
craggy
fist
,
and
for
your
entrance
you
have
planned
a
noisy
,
colorful
and
exuberant
greeting
to
your
friends
and
tenants
.
You
find
your
house
a
focus
of
public
and
police
attention
.
Can
you
imagine
yourself
forgetting
under
the
circumstances
that
you
are
approaching
this
startling
and
unexpected
situation
so
unsuitably
hatted
and
armed
with
a
paper
horn
?
?
Maybe
one
could
be
startled
into
forgetfulness
.
You
shoulder
your
way
through
the
cluster
of
the
curious
and
you
barge
up
to
the
cop
on
the
door
.
You
identify
yourself
and
ask
him
what's
going
on
.
Instead
of
answering
you
,
he
sticks
his
head
in
the
door
and
shouts
up
the
stairs
.
``
Got
the
upstairs
guy
''
,
he
bellows
.
``
The
owner
.
Do
I
send
him
up
''
?
?
Then
he
turns
back
to
you
.
``
Go
on
in
''
,
he
says
.
``
They'll
tell
you
what's
cooking
''
.
Even
then
,
as
you
go
into
the
house
oppressed
by
the
knowledge
that
something
is
cooking
and
that
your
house
has
passed
under
this
unaccountable
,
official
control
,
could
you
go
on
forgetting
that
you
still
had
that
ridiculous
hat
on
your
head
and
you
were
still
carrying
that
childish
horn
in
your
hand
?
?
What
I'm
getting
at
is
that
we
were
fully
prepared
for
Felix's
being
an
odd
one
.
We'd
seen
his
handiwork
out
in
the
back
yard
,
and
the
little
his
tenants
had
told
us
of
him
did
make
him
sound
a
little
special
.
We
were
not
,
however
,
prepared
for
anything
like
the
apparition
that
confronted
us
as
Felix
came
up
the
stairs
.
He
,
of
course
,
must
have
been
equally
unprepared
for
what
confronted
him
,
but
,
nonetheless
,
I
did
find
his
reaction
startling
.
If
Felix
was
still
wearing
the
hat
and
carrying
the
horn
because
he'd
forgotten
about
them
,
he
now
remembered
.
He
came
bounding
up
the
stairs
and
joined
the
dance
.
He
adjusted
the
hat
,
lifted
the
horn
to
his
lips
as
though
it
were
a
flute
,
and
fell
in
alongside
our
fingerprint
expert
to
cavort
with
him
.
Our
man
stopped
dead
and
glowered
at
Felix
.
Felix
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
a
laugh
that
shook
the
timbers
of
even
that
solidly
built
old
house
.
This
was
a
bull
of
a
man
.
He
was
big-chested
,
big-shouldered
and
heavy-armed
.
His
face
was
ruddy
and
heavy
and
unlined
,
and
when
he
laughed
he
showed
his
teeth
,
which
were
big
and
white
and
strong
and
unquestionably
home-grown
.
I
don't
remember
ever
seeing
teeth
that
were
quite
so
white
and
at
the
same
time
quite
so
emphatically
not
dentures
.
His
hair
had
receded
most
of
the
way
to
the
back
of
his
neck
.
He
had
only
a
fringe
of
hair
and
he
wore
it
cropped
short
.
It
was
almost
as
white
as
his
teeth
.
For
a
man
of
his
mass
he
was
curiously
short
.
He
wasn't
a
dwarf
but
he
was
a
bit
of
a
comic
figure
.
A
man
with
so
big
and
so
staggeringly
developed
a
torso
and
such
long
and
powerful
arms
is
expected
to
stand
taller
than
five
feet
five
.
For
Felix
it
was
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
make
even
that
measurement
.
The
man
was
just
this
side
of
being
a
freak
.
We
waited
till
he
had
finished
laughing
,
and
that
gave
us
a
few
moments
for
taking
stock
of
him
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
manner
Esquire
might
suggest
for
the
outdoor
man's
country
weekend
.
Dark
gray
sports
jacket
,
lighter
gray
slacks
,
pink
flannel
shirt
,
black
silk
necktie
.
His
eyes
were
clear
.
He
was
freshly
shaved
,
and
if
there
had
been
any
alcohol
in
him
we
could
never
have
missed
detecting
some
scent
of
it
on
the
massive
gusts
of
his
laughter
.
Not
even
a
whiff
.
Eventually
he
subsided
.
``
Felix
''
?
?
Gibby
said
.
``
Me
''
,
he
said
merrily
.
``
Me
,
the
happy
one
''
.
``
That
much
Latin
we
remember
''
,
Gibby
said
dryly
.
``
You
always
live
up
to
your
name
,
always
like
this
,
always
making
happy
''
?
?
``
I
try
''
,
Felix
said
blithely
.
``
The
world
is
full
of
blokes
who
put
their
hearts
into
making
the
tragic
scene
.
I've
never
noticed
that
it
improves
things
any
''
.
``
Bully
for
you
''
,
Gibby
said
.
``
What's
the
rest
of
your
name
''
?
?
``
No
rest
of
it
.
Felix
is
all
there
is
''
.
``
All
there
ever
was
''
?
?
``
The
past
I
leave
to
historians
''
,
Felix
intoned
,
demonstrating
that
he
could
be
pompous
as
well
as
happy
.
``
You
live
in
the
present
''
?
?
``
In
the
present
''
,
Felix
proclaimed
.
``
For
the
future
.
Is
there
any
other
time
in
which
a
man
can
live
''
?
?
``
We
''
,
Gibby
announced
,
``
are
not
philosophers
.
We
are
Assistant
District
Attorneys

This
gentleman
is

officer

be
made
to
include
taking
us
upstairs
,
giving
us
a
bit
of
space
in
which
our
friend
can
work
,
and
making
available
to
him
your
finger
tips
''
?
?
The
happy
one
could
never
have
looked
happier
.
This
was
more
than
joy
.
It
was
ecstasy
.
``
Those
lovely
whorls
''
,
he
chortled
.
``
So
intricate
,
so
beautiful
.
Come
right
along
.
I
love
fingerprints
''
.
He
was
prancing
along
the
hall
,
heading
for
the
next
flight
of
stairs
.
Gibby
called
him
back
.
``
We're
here
because
of
what
happened
last
night
''
,
he
said
.
``
Past
,
yes
,
but
important
.
Since
it
is
important
,
for
the
record
let's
have
the
full
name
''
.
``
That
important
''
?
?
Felix
asked
.
``
That
important
''
.
``
Grubb
''
,
Felix
whispered
.
``
Felix
Grubb
''
?
?
Gibby
asked
,
not
bothering
to
whisper
.
``
Shh
''
,
Felix
implored
.
``
I
can't
see
what
would
make
it
necessary
for
you
to
know
.
Nothing
could
make
it
necessary
to
proclaim
it
to
the
whole
world
''
.
Obligingly
Gibby
lowered
his
voice
.
``
Felix
Grubb
''
?
?
He
repeated
.
``
No
.
Edmund
,
but
not
for
years
.
For
years
it's
been
just
Felix
.
First
thing
I
did
after
my
twenty-first
birthday
was
go
into
court
and
have
it
officially
changed
,
and
this
is
something
I
don't
tell
everybody
.
That
was
almost
forty
years
ago
''
.
Having
volunteered
that
he
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
,
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
and
with
each
leap
rendered
the
number
less
credible
.
This
was
a
broth
of
a
boy
,
our
Felix
,
and
nothing
was
more
obvious
than
the
joy
he
took
in
demonstrating
how
agile
he
was
and
how
full
of
juice
and
spirit
.
We
followed
him
up
the
stairs
.
The
cops
would
gather
up
Connor
and
the
foursome
on
the
third
floor
and
bring
us
those
of
them
who
would
voluntarily
submit
to
fingerprinting
.
You
may
think
we
didn't
need
Nancy
and
Jean
,
but
you
always
get
what
you
can
when
you
can
,
and
we
had
no
guarantee
that
a
fingerprint
record
on
them
couldn't
be
useful
before
we
were
through
with
this
case
.
Also
,
if
we
had
excluded
the
ladies
we
would
have
to
that
extent
let
the
whole
world
know
at
least
that
much
of
where
we
stood
.
The
killer
,
if
in
our
present
group
,
would
certainly
be
interested
in
knowing
that
much
,
and
even
though
with
the
fingerprint
evidence
what
it
was
I
could
see
no
way
he
could
use
this
bit
of
information
to
improve
on
his
situation
,
there
might
always
be
some
way
.
If
you
can
possibly
avoid
it
,
you
don't
hand
out
any
extra
chances
.
Felix
took
us
into
his
studio
.
It
was
that
oddly
shaped
space
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
,
where
ceiling
heights
had
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
varying
angles
of
roof
slope
.
At
each
angle
of
its
pitch
a
big
skylight
had
been
fitted
into
the
roof
and
all
these
skylights
were
fitted
with
systems
of
multiple
screens
and
shades
.
When
Felix
first
opened
the
door
on
it
,
all
these
shades
were
tightly
drawn
and
the
whole
studio
was
as
dark
as
night
.
He
quickly
fixed
that
,
rolling
back
the
shades
on
some
of
the
skylights
and
adjusting
screens
on
the
others
.
He
flew
about
the
place
making
these
adjustments
and
it
was
obvious
that
what
he
was
doing
was
the
fruit
of
long
experience
.
None
of
his
movements
was
tentative
.
There
was
no
process
of
trial
and
error
.
Starting
with
the
room
completely
blacked
out
,
as
it
was
when
we
came
in
,
he
unerringly
fixed
things
so
that
the
whole
place
was
bathed
in
the
maximum
of
light
without
at
any
point
admitting
even
so
much
as
a
crack
of
glare
.
Expecting
something
more-than-average
wacky
,
I
was
surprised
by
what
we
found
.
There
was
no
display
of
either
works
in
progress
or
of
finished
work
.
Here
and
there
on
work
table
or
pedestal
stood
a
shape
with
a
sheet
or
a
tarpaulin
draped
over
it
.
These
shapes
might
have
been
mad
,
but
there
was
no
telling
.
They
were
all
completely
shrouded
.
The
equipment
was
solid
and
heavy
and
in
good
condition
.
Everything
was
orderly
and
it
seemed
to
be
arranged
for
the
workman's
comfort
,
convenience
and
efficiency
.
There
were
tools
about
but
they
were
neatly
kept
.
There
was
no
confusion
and
no
litter
.
Supplies
of
sheet
metal
were
neatly
stacked
in
bins
.
Andy
did
not
see
the
newspapers
the
next
day
.
Someone
on
his
staff
--
he
suspected
it
was
Ed
Thornburg
--
intercepted
them
and
for
this
Andy
was
grateful
.
He
finally
fell
asleep
around
six
in
the
morning
with
the
aid
of
a
sleeping
capsule
,
a
crutch
he
rarely
used
,
and
didn't
awaken
until
early
afternoon
.
Memory
flooded
him
the
instant
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
sick
feeling
knotted
his
stomach
.
Outside
his
window
bloomed
a
beautiful
summer
day
.
Presumably
the
same
sun
was
shining
upon
little
Drew
also
,
and
those
who
had
kidnapped
him
.
But
where
?
?
It
was
still
a
very
big
world
,
despite
all
the
modern
cant
to
the
contrary
.
Hub
was
sitting
in
a
chair
that
blocked
the
hall
door
.
He
was
dozing
,
perhaps
the
only
sleep
he'd
gotten
.
He
snapped
to
alertness
at
Andy's
entrance
.
``
Sorry
,
Mr.
Paxton
.
Nothing
new
.
Lot
of
people
waiting
to
see
you
,
though
''
.
``
Reporters
''
?
?
``
Our
own
people
.
Questions
about
the
show
tonight
''
.
Hub
picked
up
the
telephone
.
``
Shall
I
let
them
know
you're
awake
''
?
?
``
I
suppose
.
How's
Lissa
,
do
you
know
''
?
?
Hub
considered
.
``
Some
better
.
She's
got
plenty
of
guts
,
Mr.
Paxton
.
You
want
me
to
call
her
''
?
?
``
She
expecting
me
to
''
?
?
Hub
shook
his
head
so
Andy
told
him
not
to
bother
.
The
only
reason
for
contacting
Lissa
was
to
comfort
or
to
be
comforted
.
He
could
not
manage
the
former
or
expect
the
latter
;
;
they
had
nothing
to
give
to
each
other
.
The
omission
might
look
peculiar
to
outsiders
,
but
Andy
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
through
the
motions
simply
for
the
sake
of
appearances
.
He
had
little
time
to
himself
,
anyway
.
As
the
afternoon
sped
toward
evening
,
the
suite
saw
a
steady
procession
of
Paxton
aides
pass
in
and
out
,
each
with
his
own
special
problem
.
Thornburg
arrived
with
the
writers
.
They
had
spent
the
morning
revising
the
act
,
eliminating
all
the
gay
songs
,
patter
and
dancing
with
a
view
of
the
best
public
relations
.
What
remained
lacked
the
original
verve
but
it
was
at
least
dignified
,
as
befitting
the
tragic
circumstances
.
Raymond
Fox
reported
that
the
orchestra
had
hastily
rehearsed
``
Cradle
Song
''
in
case
it
was
needed
.
Charlie
Marble
was
back
and
forth
on
several
occasions
,
first
to
confer
with
Andy
on
the
advisability
of
cancelling
the
Las
Vegas
engagement
--
they
decided
it
was
wise
--
and
later
to
announce
that
a
prominent
comedian
,
also
an
agency
client
,
had
agreed
to
fill
the
casino's
open
date
.
And
once
Bake
slipped
in
,
pale
and
drawn
,
last
night's
liquor
still
on
his
breath
with
some
of
today's
added
to
it
.
He
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
.
Andy
invented
a
job
to
keep
him
busy
,
sending
him
ahead
to
El
Dorado
to
supervise
last
minute
arrangements
.
But
from
Rocco
Vecchio
,
they
heard
nothing
.
At
last
it
was
time
to
depart
.
Hub
,
nosing
about
,
spotted
reporters
in
the
lobby
,
so
Andy
was
hustled
away
quietly
through
the
hotel's
service
entrance
in
a
strange
car
which
Hub
had
procured
somewhere
.
They
succeeded
in
eluding
the
curious
at
the
hotel
,
but
there
was
no
chance
of
avoiding
them
at
the
nightclub
.
El
Dorado
was
surrounded
by
a
mob
.
They
overflowed
the
parking
lot
,
making
progress
by
automobile
difficult
.
Long
before
he
reached
the
protection
of
the
stage
door
,
Andy
was
recognized
.
Word
of
his
arrival
spread
through
the
crowd
like
a
brushfire
.
They
surged
around
him
,
fingers
pointing
,
eyes
prying
.
It
was
not
a
hostile
gathering
but
Andy
sensed
the
difference
from
last
night's
hero-worshippers
.
They
had
come
not
to
admire
but
to
observe
.
``
It's
worse
inside
''
,
Thornburg
informed
Andy
.
``
Skolman's
jammed
in
every
table
he
could
find
.
Under
the
heading
of
it's
an
ill
wind
,
et
cetera
''
.
Backstage
was
tomblike
by
contrast
.
Andy's
co-workers
kept
their
distance
,
awed
by
the
tragedy
.
But
in
his
dressing
room
was
a
large
bouquet
and
a
card
that
read
,
``
We're
with
you
all
the
way
''
.
It
was
signed
by
everyone
in
the
troupe
.
Andy
couldn't
help
but
be
touched
.
He
instructed
Shirl
Winter
to
compose
a
note
of
thanks
to
be
posted
on
the
call
board
.
Bake
was
waiting
to
report
that
Lou
DuVol
had
been
sobered
up
to
the
point
where
he
could
function
efficiently
.
Andy
gathered
that
this
had
been
no
small
accomplishment
.
Bake
himself
looked
better
;
;
any
kind
of
job
was
better
than
brooding
.
Andy
told
him
,
``
Bake
,
I
wish
you'd
talk
to
Skolman
,
see
if
some
kind
of
p.
a.
system
can
be
rigged
up
outside
.
It's
just
barely
possible
with
this
crowd
that
the
kidnapper
wasn't
able
to
get
a
table
.
I
wouldn't
want
him
to
miss
the
message
''
.
``
I'll
try
.
Skolman
isn't
going
to
like
it
much
,
though
,
giving
away
what
he
should
be
selling
''
.
Skolman
wasn't
the
only
one
who
didn't
care
for
Andy's
scheme
.
A
short
time
later
,
Lieutenant
Bonner
stomped
into
the
dressing
room
.
``
I
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
,
Mr.
Paxton
.
It's
those
damn
loudspeakers
''
.
Andy
rolled
up
the
revised
script
he
had
been
studying
.
``
What
about
them
''
?
?
``
They're
going
to
louse
me
up
good
.
My
men
have
been
here
all
afternoon
,
setting
up
for
this
thing
''
.
Bonner
explained
that
,
with
the
nightclub's
cooperation
,
the
police
had
occupied
El
Dorado
like
a
battlefield
.
Motion
picture
cameras
had
been
installed
to
film
the
audience
,
the
reservation
list
was
being
checked
out
name
by
name
,
and
a
special
detail
was
already
at
work
in
the
parking
lot
scrutinizing
automobiles
for
a
possible
lead
.
However
,
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
screen
the
mob
outside
,
even
if
Bonner
had
manpower
available
for
the
purpose
.
``
I
want
you
to
have
the
speakers
taken
out
''
.
Andy
sighed
.
``
Seems
like
we're
never
going
to
see
eye
to
eye
,
Lieutenant
.
Didn't
they
tell
you
what
I
wanted
the
p.
a.
system
for
''
?
?
``
Sure
,
I
know
.
But
it's
such
a
long
shot
''
--
``
No
longer
than
yours
.
What
do
you
expect
to
get
tonight
,
anyway
?
?
You
think
somebody
is
going
to
stand
up
in
the
audience
and
make
guilty
faces
?
?
Or
have
a
sign
on
his
car
that
says
,
'
Here
Comes
the
Paxton
Kidnapper
'
''
?
?
Andy
crumbled
the
script
in
his
fist
.
``
I
can't
stop
you
from
doing
what
you
think
is
right
.
But
don't
try
to
stop
me
,
either
''
.
``
Someday
''
,
Bonner
said
,
``
you're
going
to
ask
us
for
help
.
I
can
hardly
wait
''
.
``
What
you
don't
understand
is
that
I'm
asking
for
it
now
''
.
But
Bonner
departed
,
still
full
of
ill
will
.
He
had
gotten
stuck
with
a
job
too
big
for
his
imagination
;
;
he
had
to
cling
to
routine
,
tested
procedures
.
To
act
otherwise
would
be
to
admit
his
helplessness
.
But
,
admit
or
not
,
Bonner
was
helpless
.
The
crime
showed
too
much
planning
,
the
kidnappers
appeared
too
proficient
to
be
caught
by
a
checklist
.
Andy's
performance
was
scheduled
for
eleven
o'clock
.
He
stalled
for
a
half-hour
longer
,
hoping
to
hear
something
from
Vecchio
about
the
ransom
money
.
Bake
and
Shirl
Winter
,
on
separate
telephones
,
could
not
reach
him
at
any
conceivable
location
in
Los
Angeles
,
nor
could
they
secure
any
clear-cut
information
regarding
his
efforts
.
Bake
cursed
.
``
The
sweaty
bastard's
probably
halfway
to
Peru
with
our
money
by
now
''
.
When
no
one
smiled
,
he
felt
constrained
to
add
,
``
Just
kidding
,
natch
''
.
Thornburg
popped
in
to
advise
,
``
Andy
,
Skolman's
sending
up
smoke
signals
.
You
about
ready
''
?
?
``
What's
he
complaining
about
''
?
?
Bake
asked
.
``
They're
drinking
,
aren't
they
''
?
?
``
No
.
We
got
a
bunch
of
sippers
out
there
tonight
.
I
guess
nobody
wants
to
pass
out
and
miss
anything
''
.
Thornburg
added
in
a
lower
voice
but
Andy
overheard
,
``
They
act
more
like
a
jury
than
an
audience
''
.
Andy
said
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
we
can't
wait
any
longer
.
Hub
,
you
stick
by
the
stage
door
.
If
Rock
shows
up
during
the
number
--
or
you
hear
anything
--
give
me
the
signal
''
.
Shirl
Winter
said
,
``
I'll
stay
on
the
phone
,
Mr.
Paxton
.
There's
a
couple
of
call-backs
I
can
work
on
''
.
``
You're
a
sweetheart
--
but
leave
one
line
open
.
He
may
try
to
phone
us
''
.
Andy
passed
into
the
corridor
,
their
``
good
lucks
''
!
!
Following
him
.
It
was
what
they
said
before
every
performance
but
tonight
it
sounded
different
,
as
if
he
really
needed
it
.
They
were
right
.
The
act
,
cut
to
shreds
and
hastily
patched
together
during
the
afternoon
,
had
not
been
rehearsed
sufficiently
by
anyone
.
The
result
had
nothing
of
the
polish
,
pace
or
cohesion
of
the
previous
night
.
Here's
where
luck
would
normally
step
in
.
But
this
was
no
ordinary
show
and
Andy
knew
it
.
Whether
he
sang
well
or
badly
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
The
audience
had
come
not
to
be
entertained
but
to
judge
.
Twenty-four
hours
had
changed
him
from
a
performer
to
a
freak
.
Within
this
framework
,
what
followed
was
strained
,
even
macabre
.
Eliminating
the
patter
and
the
upbeat
numbers
left
little
but
blues
and
other
songs
of
equal
melancholy
.
The
effect
was
as
depressing
as
a
gravestone
,
the
applause
irresolute
and
short-lived
.
Yet
Andy
plowed
ahead
,
mouthing
the
inconsequential
words
as
if
they
possessed
real
meaning
,
and
gradually
his
listeners
warmed
to
him
.
Their
clapping
grew
more
fervent
;
;
the
evening
was
still
not
beyond
salvaging
,
not
as
a
show
but
for
him
as
a
person
.
The
worst
was
yet
to
come
.
As
Andy
reached
the
finale
of
his
act
,
a
subdued
commotion
backstage
drew
his
attention
to
the
wings
.
Rocco
Vecchio
--
a
perspiring
,
haggard
Vecchio
--
was
standing
there
,
flanked
by
two
men
in
the
uniforms
of
armored
transport
guards
.
Vecchio
was
nodding
and
pointing
at
the
large
suitcase
he
held
.
Andy
felt
his
heart
thud
heavily
with
relief
.
He
waved
at
Fox
to
cut
off
the
finale
introduction
.
The
music
died
away
discordantly
.
He
drew
a
deep
breath
.
``
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
in
place
of
my
regular
closing
number
tonight
,
I'd
like
to
sing
something
of
a
different
nature
for
you
.
Ray
,
if
you
please
--
the
'
Cradle
Song
'
''
.
He
sensed
rather
than
heard
the
gasp
that
swept
across
the
audience
.
Nor
could
he
blame
them
.
This
particular
song
at
this
particular
time
could
only
be
interpreted
as
the
ultimate
in
bad
taste
,
callous
exploitation
beyond
the
bounds
of
decency
.
Having
no
choice
,
he
plunged
into
it
,
anyway
,
holding
onto
the
microphone
for
support
.
``
Lullaby
and
goodnight
.
''
His
voice
shook
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
forgot
the
lyrics
midway
through
and
had
to
cover
up
by
humming
the
rest
.
He
wondered
if
the
audience
would
let
him
finish
.
They
did
;
;
though
contemptuous
,
they
were
still
polite
.
But
when
he
was
finally
through
,
their
scorn
was
made
apparent
.
Someone
clapped
tentatively
then
quickly
stopped
.
Otherwise
,
the
silence
was
complete
.
As
the
lights
came
up
,
Andy
could
see
that
a
number
of
patrons
were
already
on
their
way
toward
the
exit
.
He
stumbled
off-stage
.
``
My
God
''
,
he
muttered
.
``
My
God
''
.
Hub
was
there
to
support
him
.
``
It's
okay
,
Mr.
Paxton
.
The
money's
here
,
all
of
it
''
.
At
this
moment
,
all
he
could
think
of
was
what
he'd
been
forced
to
undergo
.
``
Did
you
hear
them
?
?
Do
you
know
what
they
think
of
me
''
?
?
``
Bunch
of
damn
jerks
''
,
Hub
growled
.
``
Who
needs
them
''
?
?
Thornburg
patted
his
arm
.
``
Sure
,
Andy
,
it'll
be
all
right
.
Nothing
broken
that
can't
be
mended
''
.
The
words
were
hollow
.
Thornburg
knew
,
better
than
any
of
them
,
that
a
public
image
was
as
fragile
as
Humpty
Dumpty
.
All
the
king's
horses
and
all
the
king's
men
Vecchio
shouldered
in
.
``
I
got
it
,
Andy
.
God
knows
how
,
but
I
got
it
.
You'll
never
believe
the
places
I've
been
today
.
I
practically
had
to
sign
your
life
away
,
you'll
probably
fire
me
for
some
of
the
deals
I
had
to
go
for
,
but
''
--
Andy
nodded
dully
.
``
It
doesn't
matter
,
Rock
.
We've
done
our
part
''
.
He
clutched
that
knowledge
to
him
as
he
returned
to
his
dressing
room
.
The
usual
congratulatory
crowd
was
conspicuously
absent
;
;
the
place
had
the
air
of
a
morgue
.
Andy
had
no
desire
to
linger
himself
but
Hub
reported
that
the
mob
outside
was
still
large
despite
the
efforts
of
the
police
to
disperse
them
.
His
son
watched
until
he
got
as
far
as
the
hall
,
almost
out
of
sight
,
then
hurried
after
.
``
Dad
.
Dad
,
wait
''
.
He
caught
up
with
the
old
man
in
the
living
room
.
Old
man
Arthur
had
put
down
the
suitcase
to
open
the
front
door
.
``
Just
this
one
favor
,
Dad
.
Just
don't
tell
Ferguson
that
crazy
opinion
of
yours
''
.
``
Why
not
''
?
?
The
old
man
gave
the
room
a
stare
in
leaving
;
;
under
the
scraggly
brows
the
pale
old
eyes
burned
with
a
bitter
memory
.
``
It's
the
truth
''
.
``
The
Bartlett
girl
was
killed
by
Mr.
Dronk's
son
.
Rossi
and
Ferguson
have
been
across
the
street
,
talking
to
the
kid
.
They've
found
some
sort
of
new
evidence
,
a
bundle
of
clothes
or
something
,
and
it
must
link
the
kid
even
stronger
to
the
crime
.
Why
won't
you
accept
facts
?
?
The
two
kids
were
together
a
lot
,
they
were
having
some
kind
of
teen-age
affair
--
God
knows
how
far
that
had
gone
--
and
the
kid's
crippled
.
He
limps
,
and
the
man
who
hit
you
and
took
the
cane
,
he
limped
.
My
God
,
how
much
more
do
you
want
''
?
?
His
father
looked
him
over
closely
.
``
You
sound
like
an
old
woman
.
You
should
have
gone
to
work
today
,
'stead
of
sneaking
around
spying
on
the
Dronk
house
''
.
``
Now
,
see
here
''
--
``
The
trouble
with
you
''
,
old
man
Arthur
began
,
and
then
checked
himself
.
Young
Mrs.
Arthur
had
opened
the
oven
and
there
was
a
drifting
odor
of
hot
biscuits
.
The
old
man
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
.
``
Isn't
enough
time
to
go
into
it
''
,
he
finished
,
and
slammed
the
door
in
his
son's
face
.
Mrs.
Holden
turned
from
the
window
draperies
.
``
They
found
something
else
up
there
''
,
she
said
half-aloud
to
the
empty
room
.
``
They
took
it
away
,
overalls
or
something
''
.
She
walked
restlessly
across
the
room
,
then
back
to
the
windows
.
``
Now
they've
gone
,
they
didn't
come
back
,
and
they
didn't
arrest
that
Dronk
boy
''
.
She
stood
frowning
and
chewing
her
lip
.
She
was
wearing
a
brown
cotton
dress
,
cut
across
the
hips
in
a
way
that
was
supposed
to
make
her
look
slimmer
,
a
yoke
set
into
the
skirt
and
flaring
pleats
below
.
She
smoothed
the
skirt
,
sat
down
,
then
stood
up
and
went
back
to
the
windows
.
``
Why
on
earth
did
I
send
him
off
to
work
?
?
There
was
excuse
enough
to
keep
him
home
that
young
Mr.
Arthur's
still
over
there
''
.
With
sudden
energy
,
she
went
to
the
phone
and
rang
Holden's
office
and
asked
for
him
.
``
I
think
you
had
better
come
home
''
.
``
Mae
,
we're
so
busy
.
Mr.
Crosson's
been
on
everybody's
neck
,
an
order
he
expected
didn't
come
through
and
he's
''
--
``
I
don't
care
.
I
want
you
here
.
I'm
all
alone
and
certain
things
are
going
on
that
look
very
ominous
.
I
need
someone
to
go
out
and
find
out
what's
happening
''
.
``
But
I
couldn't
do
that
,
even
if
I
were
home
''
!
!
His
voice
grew
high
and
trembling
.
``
I
can't
be
underfoot
every
time
those
cops
turn
around
!
!
They'll
they'll
think
I
did
something
''
.
He
couldn't
see
the
grin
that
split
her
mouth
;
;
the
teeth
that
shone
into
the
phone
were
like
a
shark's
.
``
You'll
just
have
to
risk
it
.
You
can't
wander
along
in
the
dark
,
can
you
?
?
I'd
think
that
you
even
more
than
I
would
be
wondering
what
they're
up
to
.
They
found
some
clothes
''
,
she
tossed
in
.
``
What
''
?
?
Deliberately
,
she
ignored
the
yelp
.
``
Also
,
that
Mr.
Ferguson
was
here
.
I
guess
he
wants
to
ask
you
some
questions
.
I
stalled
him
off
.
He
doesn't
expect
you
until
five
''
.
``
Then
I'd
better
wait
until
five
''
.
``
No-o-o
.
Come
home
right
away
''
.
She
slapped
the
receiver
into
its
holder
and
stepped
away
.
Her
eyes
were
bright
with
anticipation
.
In
his
office
,
Mr.
Holden
replaced
the
phone
slowly
.
He
rose
from
his
chair
.
He
had
to
cough
then
;
;
he
went
to
the
window
and
choked
there
with
the
fresh
breeze
on
his
face
.
He
got
his
hat
out
of
the
closet
.
For
a
moment
he
thought
of
going
into
Crosson's
office
to
explain
that
he
had
to
leave
,
but
there
was
now
such
a
pain
in
his
chest
,
such
a
pounding
in
his
head
,
that
he
decided
to
let
it
go
.
He
passed
the
receptionist
in
the
outer
office
,
muttering
,
``
I've
got
to
go
out
for
a
little
while
''
.
Let
her
call
Crosson
if
she
wanted
to
,
let
Crosson
raise
the
roof
or
even
can
him
,
he
didn't
care
.
He
got
into
the
car
.
Putting
the
key
into
the
switch
,
pressing
the
accelerator
with
his
foot
,
putting
the
car
into
reverse
,
seemed
vast
endeavors
almost
beyond
the
ability
of
his
shaking
body
.
Once
out
in
the
street
,
the
traffic
was
a
gadfly
maze
in
which
he
wandered
stricken
.
When
he
turned
into
the
highway
that
led
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
then
rose
toward
home
,
he
had
to
pull
over
to
the
curb
and
wait
for
a
few
minutes
,
sucking
in
air
and
squinting
and
blinking
his
eyes
to
clear
them
of
tears
.
What
on
earth
was
in
Mae's
mind
,
that
she
wanted
him
up
there
spying
on
what
the
cops
were
doing
?
?
What
did
she
think
he
could
do
?
?
He
tried
to
ignore
what
his
own
common
sense
told
him
,
but
it
wasn't
possible
;
;
her
motives
were
too
blatant
.
She
wanted
him
to
get
into
trouble
.
She
wanted
the
police
to
notice
him
,
suspect
him
.
She
was
going
to
keep
on
scheming
,
poking
,
prodding
,
suggesting
,
and
dictating
until
the
cops
got
up
enough
interest
in
him
to
go
back
to
their
old
neighborhood
and
ask
questions
.
And
he
knew
in
that
moment
,
with
a
cold
sinking
of
despair
,
a
dying
of
old
hopes
,
that
Mae
had
spread
some
kind
of
word
there
among
the
neighbors
.
Nothing
bald
,
open
;
;
but
enough
.
They'd
have
some
suspicions
to
repeat
to
the
police
.
Though
his
inner
thoughts
cringed
at
it
,
he
forced
himself
to
think
back
,
recreating
the
scene
in
which
Mae
claimed
to
have
caught
him
molesting
the
child
.
It
hadn't
amounted
to
anything
.
There
had
been
nothing
evil
or
dirty
in
his
intentions
.
A
second
scene
flashed
before
his
mind
,
the
interior
of
the
garage
at
the
new
house
and
the
young
Bartlett
girl
turning
startled
to
meet
him
,
the
dim
dark
and
the
sudden
confusion
and
fear
and
then
the
brightness
as
Mae
had
clicked
on
the
light
.
Suppose
the
cops
somehow
got
hold
of
that
?
?
Well
,
it
hadn't
been
what
it
seemed
,
he'd
had
no
idea
the
girl
was
in
there
.
He
hadn't
touched
her
.
And
when
he
came
to
examine
the
scene
,
there
was
a
certain
staginess
to
it
,
it
had
the
smell
of
planning
,
and
a
swift
suspicion
darted
into
his
mind
.
Too
monstrous
,
of
course
.
Mae
wouldn't
have
plotted
a
thing
like
that
.
It
was
just
that
little
accidents
played
into
her
hands
.
Like
this
murder
.
He
leaned
on
the
wheel
,
clutching
it
,
staring
into
the
sunlight
,
and
tried
to
bring
order
into
his
thoughts
.
He
felt
light-headed
and
sick
.
There
was
no
use
wandering
off
into
a
territory
of
utter
nightmare
.
Mae
was
his
wife
.
She
was
married
to
him
for
better
or
for
worse
.
She
wouldn't
be
wilfully
planning
his
destruction
.
But
she
was
.
She
was
.
Even
as
the
conviction
of
truth
roared
through
him
,
shattering
his
last
hope
of
safety
,
he
was
reaching
to
release
the
hand
brake
,
to
head
up
the
road
for
home
,
doing
her
bidding
.
He
drove
,
and
the
road
wobbled
,
familiar
scenes
crept
past
on
either
side
.
He
came
to
a
stretch
of
old
orange
groves
,
the
trees
dead
,
some
of
them
uprooted
,
and
then
there
was
an
outlying
shopping
area
,
and
tract
houses
.
He
had
the
feeling
that
he
should
abandon
the
car
and
run
off
somewhere
to
hide
.
But
he
couldn't
imagine
where
.
There
was
really
no
place
to
go
,
finally
,
except
home
to
Mae
.
At
the
gate
he
slowed
,
looking
around
.
Cooper
was
beside
his
car
,
on
the
curb
at
the
right
,
just
standing
there
morosely
;
;
he
didn't
even
look
up
.
Behind
him
on
the
steps
of
the
little
office
sat
old
man
Arthur
;
;
he
was
straight
,
something
angry
in
his
attitude
,
as
if
he
might
be
waiting
to
report
something
.
Holden
stepped
on
the
gas
.
A
new
idea
drifted
in
from
nowhere
.
He
could
go
to
the
police
.
He
could
tell
them
his
fears
of
being
involved
,
he
could
explain
what
had
happened
in
the
old
neighborhood
and
how
Mae
had
misunderstood
and
how
she
had
held
it
over
him
--
the
scene
was
complete
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
,
even
to
his
own
jerkings
and
snivelings
,
and
Ferguson's
silent
patience
.
He
could
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
Police
Department
.
It
wasn't
what
Mae
would
want
him
to
do
,
though
.
He
was
sure
of
this
.
Once
he
had
abandoned
himself
to
the
very
worst
,
once
he
had
quieted
all
the
dragons
of
worry
and
suspense
,
there
wouldn't
be
very
much
for
Mae
to
do
.
At
that
moment
,
Holden
almost
slammed
on
the
brakes
to
go
back
to
Cooper
and
ask
if
Ferguson
was
about
.
It
would
be
such
a
relief
.
What
was
that
old
sign
,
supposed
to
be
painted
over
a
door
somewhere
,
Abandon
hope
,
all
ye
who
enter
here
?
?
Why
,
Holden
said
to
himself
,
surprised
at
his
own
sudden
insight
,
I'll
bet
some
of
those
people
who
enter
are
just
as
happy
as
can
be
.
They've
worried
,
they've
lain
awake
nights
,
they've
shook
at
the
slightest
footstep
,
they've
pictured
their
own
destruction
,
and
now
it's
all
over
and
they
can
give
up
.
Sure
,
they're
giving
up
hope
.
Hand
in
hand
with
hope
went
things
like
terror
and
apprehension
.
Good-bye
.
Holden
waved
a
hand
at
the
empty
street
.
Glad
to
see
you
go
.
He
drove
into
the
paved
space
before
the
garage
and
got
out
,
slamming
the
car
door
.
He
looked
up
and
down
the
street
.
If
Ferguson's
car
had
been
in
sight
,
Holden
would
have
walked
directly
to
it
.
He
went
to
the
front
door
and
opened
it
and
looked
in
.
Mae
entered
the
room
from
the
hallway
to
the
kitchen
.
She
had
a
cup
of
something
steaming
,
coffee
perhaps
,
in
one
hand
,
a
fresh
piece
of
toast
in
the
other
.
She
stood
there
,
watching
Holden
come
in
,
and
she
put
the
piece
of
toast
in
her
mouth
and
bit
off
one
corner
with
a
huge
chomp
of
her
white
teeth
.
``
Mae
''
--
``
I've
been
thinking
''
,
she
said
,
swallowing
the
toast
.
``
Didn't
you
have
an
old
pair
of
painting
overalls
in
the
garage
?
?
You
used
them
that
time
you
painted
the
porch
at
our
other
house
.
And
then
you
wiped
up
some
grease
''
.
She
had
caught
him
off
guard
,
no
preparation
,
nothing
certain
but
that
ahead
lay
some
kind
of
disaster
.
``
No
.
Wait
a
minute
.
What
do
you
''
--
``
I've
been
looking
for
them
,
and
they're
gone
.
I'm
sure
they
were
in
the
garage
up
until
a
couple
of
days
ago
.
Or
even
yesterday
.
You
used
to
paint
in
them
,
and
then
you
just
took
them
for
rags
.
The
police
have
them
now
''
.
``
I
don't
remember
any
overalls
at
all
''
.
``
They
were
all
faded
.
Worn
through
at
the
knees
''
.
She
stood
sipping
and
chewing
and
watching
.
``
Green
paint
,
wasn't
it
?
?
Well
,
I'm
not
sure
of
the
color
.
But
you
had
them
''
.
``
Mae
,
sit
down
.
Put
down
the
cup
of
coffee
.
Tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
''
.
She
shook
her
head
.
She
took
another
bite
of
toast
.
Holden
noticed
almost
absently
how
she
chewed
,
how
the
whole
side
of
her
cheek
moved
,
a
slab
of
fat
that
extended
down
into
her
neck
.
``
My
goodness
,
you
ought
to
remember
if
I
do
.
You're
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
police
and
explain
what
happened
.
Tell
them
the
truth
or
something
before
they
come
here
''
.
A
seeping
coldness
entered
Holden's
being
;
;
his
nerves
seemed
frost-bitten
down
to
the
tips
of
his
tingling
fingers
and
his
spine
felt
stiff
and
glass-like
,
liable
to
break
like
an
icicle
at
any
moment
.
``
I've
never
owned
any
painting
overalls
.
A
man
with
a
sketch
pad
in
hand
sat
with
a
large
pink
woman
in
a
small
office
at
the
end
of
a
long
,
dim
corridor
and
made
pencil
lines
on
paper
and
said
,
``
Is
this
more
like
it
,
Mrs.
MacReady
?
?
Or
are
the
eyebrows
more
like
this
''
?
?
When
he
had
finished
with
that
,
he
would
go
to
another
part
of
the
hotel
and
say
much
the
same
things
to
someone
else
,
most
probably
a
busboy
.
``
Begin
to
look
like
him
now
,
would
you
say
?
?
Different
about
the
mouth
,
huh
?
?
More
like
this
,
maybe
''
?
?
Men
blew
dust
on
objects
in
a
room
on
the
seventeenth
floor
of
the
Hotel
Dumont
and
blew
it
off
again
,
and
did
the
same
in
a
tiny
,
almost
airless
room
in
a
tenement
in
the
West
Forties
.
And
men
also
used
vacuum
cleaners
in
both
rooms
,
sucking
dust
up
once
more
.
Men
from
the
Third
Detective
District
,
Eighteenth
Precinct
,
had
the
longest
,
the
most
tedious
,
job
.
At
the
Hotel
Dumont
there
had
,
at
the
time
in
issue
,
been
twenty-three
overnighters
,
counting
couples
as
singular
.
These
included
,
as
one
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Anthony
Payne
,
who
had
checked
in
a
little
after
noon
the
day
before
,
and
had
not
checked
out
together
.
But
Gardner
Willings
was
not
included
;
;
he
had
been
at
the
Dumont
for
almost
a
week
.
There
was
,
of
course
,
no
special
reason
to
believe
that
the
man
or
woman
they
sought
had
stayed
only
overnight
at
the
hotel
.
The
twenty-three
(
or
twenty-two
with
the
Paynes
themselves
omitted
)
provided
merely
a
place
to
start
,
and
their
identification
was
the
barest
of
starts
.
With
names
and
addresses
listed
,
verification
came
next
.
It
would
take
time
;
;
it
would
,
almost
inevitably
,
trouble
some
water
.
(
``
I
certainly
was
not
at
the
Dumont
last
night
and
my
husband
couldn't
have
been
.
He's
in
Boston
.
Of
course
he's
in
''
--
)
The
Hotel
King
Arthur
across
the
street
provided
almost
twice
as
many
problems
.
The
King
Arthur
offered
respectable
and
convenient
lodgings
to
people
from
the
suburbs
who
wanted
to
see
a
show
and
didn't
want
--
heaven
knew
didn't
want
!
!
--
to
lunge
anxiously
through
crowded
streets
to
railroad
stations
and
,
at
odd
hours
of
night
,
drive
from
smaller
stations
to
distant
homes
,
probably
through
rain
or
,
in
November
,
something
worse
.
The
King
Arthur
was
less
expensive
than
the
Dumont
.
The
King
Arthur
had
fifty-four
overnighters
,
again
counting
rooms
rather
than
people
.
Check
the
overnighters
out
.
Failing
to
find
what
was
wanted
,
as
was
most
likely
,
check
out
other
guests
,
with
special
--
but
not
exclusive
--
attention
to
those
with
rooms
on
the
street
.
(
Anyone
active
enough
can
reach
a
roof
,
wherever
his
room
may
be
.
)
And
know
,
while
all
this
went
on
,
that
there
was
no
real
reason
to
suppose
that
the
murderer
had
been
a
guest
in
either
hotel
.
It
was
not
even
certain
the
shot
had
been
fired
from
either
hotel
.
There
were
other
roofs
,
less
convenient
but
not
impossible
.
It
is
dull
business
,
detecting
,
and
hard
on
feet
.
There
was
also
the
one
salient
question
to
ask
,
and
ask
widely
:
Did
you
notice
anything
out
of
the
way
?
?
Like
,
for
example
,
a
man
carrying
a
twenty-two
rifle
,
probably
with
a
telescopic
sight
attached
?
?
There
was
,
of
course
,
no
hope
it
really
would
be
that
simple
.
The
sniper
,
whether
psychopathic
marksman
or
murderer
by
intent
,
would
hardly
have
walked
to
his
vantage
point
with
rifle
over
shoulder
,
whistling
a
marching
tune
.
Anybody
carrying
anything
that
might
hide
a
rifle
?
?
Long
thin
suitcase
?
?
Or
long
fat
suitcase
,
for
that
matter
?
?
Shrugs
met
that
,
from
room
clerks
,
from
bellhops
.
Who
measures
?
?
But
nothing
,
it
appeared
,
long
enough
to
attract
attention
.
Cases
,
say
,
for
musical
instruments
?
?
None
noted
at
the
Dumont
.
Several
at
the
King
Arthur
.
A
combo
was
staying
there
.
And
had
been
for
a
week
.
Anything
else
?
?
Anything
at
all
?
?
Shrugs
met
that
.
(
Detective
Pearson
,
Eighteenth
Precinct
,
thought
for
a
time
he
might
be
on
to
something
.
A
refuse
bin
at
the
Dumont
turned
up
a
florist's
box
--
a
very
long
box
for
very
long-stemmed
flowers
.
Traces
of
oil
on
green
tissue
?
?
The
lab
to
check
.
The
lab
:
sorry
.
No
oil
.
)
Anything
at
all
strange
?
?
Well
,
a
man
had
tried
,
at
the
King
Arthur
,
to
register
with
an
ocelot
.
At
the
Dumont
,
a
guest
had
come
in
a
collapsible
wheel
chair
.
At
the
King
Arthur
one
guest
had
had
his
head
heavily
bandaged
,
and
another
had
a
bandaged
foot
and
had
walked
with
crutches
.
There
had
also
been
a
man
who
must
have
had
St.
Vitus
or
something
,
because
he
kept
jerking
his
head
.
As
reports
dribbled
in
,
William
Weigand
tossed
them
into
the
centrifuge
which
had
become
his
head
.
Mullins
came
in
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Mrs.
Lauren
Payne
at
her
house
on
Nod
Road
,
Ridgefield
,
Connecticut
.
The
house
was
modern
,
large
,
on
five
acres
.
Must
have
cost
plenty
.
The
State
cops
would
check
from
time
to
time
;
;
pass
word
when
there
was
word
to
pass
.
Weigand
tossed
this
news
into
the
centrifuge
.
Sort
things
out
,
damn
it
.
Sort
out
the
next
move
.
Try
to
forget
motive
for
the
moment
.
Consider
opportunity
.
Only
those
actually
with
Payne
when
he
was
shot
,
or
who
had
left
the
party
within
not
more
than
five
minutes
(
make
five
arbitrary
)
positively
had
none
.
The
Norths
;
;
Hathaway
,
Jerry's
publicity
director
;
;
Livingston
Birdwood
,
producer
of
Uprising
.
They
had
been
with
Payne
when
he
was
shot
,
could
not
therefore
have
shot
him
from
above
.
Take
Gardner
Willings
.
He
had
left
after
the
scuffle
;
;
had
been
seen
to
leave
.
He
would
have
had
ample
time
to
go
into
a
blind
somewhere
and
wait
his
prey
.
Consider
him
seriously
,
therefore
?
?
Intangibles
entered
,
then
--
hunches
which
felt
like
facts
.
Willings
would
ambush
,
certainly
;
;
Willings
undoubtedly
had
.
Willings
was
,
presumably
,
a
better
than
average
shot
.
But
--
hunch
,
now
--
Willings
would
not
ambush
anything
which
went
on
two
legs
instead
of
four
.
Because
,
if
for
no
other
reason
,
Willings
would
never
for
a
moment
suppose
he
was
not
bigger
,
tougher
,
than
anything
else
that
went
on
two
legs
.
Ambushes
are
laid
by
those
who
doubt
themselves
,
as
any
man
may
against
a
tiger
.
Faith
Constable
had
had
to
``
go
on
''
from
the
party
and
had
,
presumably
,
gone
on
.
To
be
checked
out
further
.
Forget
motive
?
?
No
,
motive
is
a
part
of
fact
.
Nobody
in
his
right
mind
punishes
a
quarter-century-old
dereliction
.
Grudges
simply
do
not
keep
that
well
in
a
sane
mind
.
Faith
Constable
had
accomplished
much
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
.
Jeopardize
it
now
to
correct
so
old
a
wrong
?
?
Bill
shook
his
head
.
Also
,
he
thought
,
I
doubt
if
she
could
hit
the
side
of
a
barn
with
a
shotgun
.
Lauren
herself
?
?
She
had
left
the
party
early
,
pleading
a
headache
.
No
lack
of
opportunity
,
presuming
she
had
a
gun
.
She
might
,
conceivably
,
have
brought
one
in
in
a
large-enough
suitcase
.
(
Check
on
the
Payne
luggage
.
)
She
might
now
have
taken
it
away
again
.
Motive
--
her
husband
wandering
?
?
Bitter
,
unreasoning
jealousy
?
?
Heaven
knew
it
happened
and
hell
knew
it
too
.
But
--
it
happened
,
almost
always
,
among
the
primitive
and
,
usually
,
among
the
very
young
.
(
Call
it
mentally
young
;
;
call
it
retarded
.
)
There
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
Lauren
Payne
was
primitive
.
She
did
not
move
in
primitive
circles
.
She
was
young
,
but
not
that
young
.
It
occurred
to
Bill
Weigand
that
he
was
,
on
a
hunch
basis
,
eliminating
a
good
many
.
He
reminded
himself
that
all
eliminations
were
tentative
.
He
also
reminded
himself
that
he
had
an
unusual
number
of
possibilities
.
The
Masons
,
mother
or
son
,
or
mother
and
son
?
?
Opportunity
was
obvious
.
Motive
.
Here
,
too
,
the
cause
to
hate
lay
well
back
in
the
years
.
But
bitterness
had
more
cause
to
remain
,
even
increasingly
to
corrode
.
With
the
boy
,
particularly
.
The
boy
had
,
apparently
--
if
Mrs.
MacReady
was
right
in
what
she
had
told
Mullins
--
only
in
recent
months
been
forced
to
give
up
college
,
to
work
as
a
busboy
.
Seeing
the
man
he
blamed
for
this
made
much
of
--
youth
and
bitterness
and
--
Bill
picked
up
the
telephone
;
;
got
Mullins
.
``
Send
out
a
pickup
on
Mrs.
Mason
and
the
boy
when
you've
got
enough
to
go
on
''
,
Bill
said
.
``
Right
''
?
?
Mullins
would
do
.
A
man
named
Lars
Simon
,
playwright-director
,
had
expressed
a
wish
that
Anthony
Payne
drop
dead
.
He
would
say
,
of
course
,
that
he
had
not
really
had
any
such
wish
;
;
that
what
he
had
said
was
no
more
than
one
of
those
things
one
does
say
,
lightly
,
meaning
nothing
.
Which
probably
would
turn
out
to
be
true
;
;
which
he
obviously
had
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
say
.
A
man
named
Blaine
Smythe
,
with
``
y
''
and
``
e
''
but
pronounced
without
them
,
had
been
fired
at
Payne's
insistence
.
He
was
also
,
if
Pam
North
was
right
,
a
closer
acquaintance
of
Lauren
Payne's
than
she
,
now
,
was
inclined
to
admit
.
He
might
deny
the
latter
;
;
would
certainly
deny
any
connection
between
the
two
things
,
or
any
connection
of
either
with
murder
.
He
would
have
to
be
given
the
opportunity
.
Mullins
?
?
It
was
evident
that
Mullins
was
the
man
to
go
.
It
was
evident
that
a
captain
should
remain
at
his
desk
,
directing
with
a
firm
hand
and
keeping
a
firm
seat
.
Bill
Weigand
was
good
and
tired
of
the
wall
opposite
,
and
the
crack
in
the
plaster
.
Let
Mullins
keep
the
firm
seat
;
;
let
Stein
.
When
Siamese
cats
are
intertwined
it
is
difficult
to
tell
where
one
leaves
off
and
another
begins
.
Stilts
and
Shadow
,
on
Pam's
bed
,
appeared
to
be
one
cat
--
rather
large
,
as
Siamese
cats
go
,
and
,
to
be
sure
,
having
two
heads
and
two
tails
.
On
the
other
hand
,
they
,
or
it
,
seemed
to
have
no
legs
whatever
.
Pamela
North
said
,
``
Hi
''
,
to
her
cats
,
and
added
that
proper
cats
met
their
humans
at
the
door
.
Of
four
dark
brown
ears
,
one
twitched
slightly
at
this
.
``
All
right
''
,
Pam
said
.
``
I
know
it
isn't
dinnertime
''
.
But
at
this
the
one
too-large
cat
suddenly
became
two
cats
,
stretching
.
Shadow
,
the
more
talkative
,
began
at
once
to
talk
,
her
voice
piteous
.
Stilts
,
a
more
direct
cat
,
leaped
from
the
bed
and
trotted
briskly
toward
the
kitchen
.
Shadow
looked
surprised
,
wailed
,
and
trotted
after
her
.
The
hell
it
isn't
dinnertime
,
two
waving
tails
told
Pam
North
.
It
was
not
,
whatever
tale
was
told
by
tails
.
Martha
presumably
would
cope
.
She
might
be
firm
.
It
was
most
unlikely
that
she
would
be
firm
.
They
want
to
be
fat
cats
,
Pam
thought
,
and
lighted
a
cigarette
and
leaned
back
on
a
chaise
and
considered
pulling
her
thoughts
together
.
After
a
time
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
thoughts
were
not
worth
the
trouble
.
A
vague
feeling
that
Anthony
Payne
had
had
it
coming
was
hardly
a
thought
and
was
,
in
any
event
,
reprehensible
.
Had
Faith
Constable's
explanation
of
her
confidence
,
so
uninvited
,
been
a
little
thin
?
?
That
was
more
like
a
thought
,
but
not
a
great
deal
more
.
Had
that
tall
dark
boy
,
carrying
trays
too
heavy
for
him
,
found
what
he
might
have
considered
adulation
of
a
man
he
probably
hated
more
than
he
could
bear
?
?
And
possessed
himself
--
how
?
?
--
of
a
rifle
and
killed
?
?
Pam
found
she
had
no
answers
;
;
had
only
a
hope
.
The
poor
kid
--
the
poor
,
frail
kid
.
Some
people
have
luck
and
some
have
no
luck
and
that
,
whatever
people
who
prefer
order
say
,
is
the
size
of
it
.
The
poor
,
unlucky
--
The
telephone
rang
.
Pam
realized
,
to
her
surprise
,
that
she
had
been
almost
dozing
.
At
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
Two
martinis
for
lunch
--
that
was
the
trouble
.
I
ought
to
remember
.
Don't
pretend
.
You
do
remember
.
You
just
--
``
Hello
?
?
Yes
,
this
is
she
?
?
What
''
?
?
The
voice
had
music
in
it
.
Even
with
words
coming
too
fast
,
they
came
on
the
music
of
the
voice
.
``
I
said
I
would
''
,
Pam
said
.
``
They
won't
talk
about
who
gave
the
information
.
Not
unless
they
have
to
.
They
don't
,
Mrs.
Constable
.
Not
unless
they
have
''
--
She
was
interrupted
.
``
Call
this
a
cry
for
help
''
,
Faith
Constable
said
.
``
Through
a
door
conveniently
unlocked
''
,
Madden
supplemented
.
``
That
damn
door
''
,
said
the
police
chief
.
``
A
gift
horse
to
be
viewed
with
suspicion
''
.
Madden's
dark
face
wore
a
meditative
look
.
``
If
there
was
collusion
between
an
outside
murderer
and
a
member
of
the
household
it
would
be
an
elementary
precaution
to
check
on
the
door
later
.
And
it
makes
a
very
poor
red
herring
for
an
inside
job
.
Much
better
to
break
a
cellar
window
''
.
``
Don't
forget
,
there
was
the
hope
it
would
pass
for
a
natural
death
''
,
Pauling
reminded
him
.
``
Well
,
with
a
house
as
big
as
that
there
must
be
at
least
one
cellar
window
that
wouldn't
be
noticed
right
away
unless
there
was
a
police
investigation
''
.
``
Yeah
.
And
a
pane
of
glass
isn't
hard
to
''
--
The
telephone
interrupted
him
.
He
scooped
up
the
receiver
and
said
,
``
Police
chief
''
,
into
the
mouthpiece
,
and
then
,
``
Oh
yes
,
Mr.
Benson
.
I
was
hoping
I'd
hear
from
you
today
''
.
With
his
free
hand
he
pulled
a
pad
and
pencil
toward
him
and
began
to
make
notes
as
he
listened
,
saying
,
``
Uh-huh
''
and
``
I
see
''
at
intervals
.
At
last
he
said
,
``
Well
,
thank
you
for
calling
,
Mr.
Benson
.
Although
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
we've
been
handling
it
as
one
I'm
glad
to
have
it
made
official
''
.
He
hung
up
.
``
Coroner
''
,
he
said
to
Madden
.
``
He's
just
heard
from
the
pathologist
who
says
Mrs.
Meeker
apparently
died
from
suffocation
''
.
Pauling
looked
at
his
notes
.
``
Many
minute
hemorrhages
in
the
lungs
;
;
particles
of
lint
and
thread
in
the
mouth
and
nostrils
.
Scrapings
from
the
bed
linen
identical
with
the
lint
and
thread
found
in
the
nasal
and
oral
cavities
.
No
other
cause
of
death
apparent
.
Trachea
clear
of
mucus
and
foreign
objects
.
Brain
examined
for
thrombosis
,
clot
or
hemorrhage
.
No
signs
of
these
,
no
gross
hemorrhage
of
lungs
,
heart
,
brain
or
stomach
''
.
He
paused
.
``
That's
about
it
.
Oh
,
the
time
of
death
.
The
duration
of
the
digestive
process
varies
,
the
pathologist
says
,
but
the
empty
stomach
and
the
findings
in
the
upper
gastrointestinal
tract
indicate
that
Mrs.
Meeker
died
several
hours
after
her
seven-o'clock
dinner
.
Probably
around
midnight
,
give
or
take
an
hour
either
way
''
.
Pauling
paused
again
.
``
So
there
it
is
''
,
he
said
.
``
Not
your
problem
,
of
course
,
unless
Johnston
and
the
murderer
are
one
and
the
same
''
.
They
discussed
this
possibility
.
However
likely
it
was
,
Pauling
said
,
he
couldn't
limit
himself
to
it
.
He
had
to
look
for
other
prospects
,
other
motives
until
more
conclusive
evidence
pointing
to
Johnston
came
to
light
.
Madden
,
with
his
investigation
centered
on
the
fraud
,
said
that
tomorrow
he
would
go
to
the
Bronx
bank
through
which
Mrs.
Meeker's
checks
to
Johnston
had
cleared
.
Arthur
Williams
had
to
be
located
,
they
agreed
.
He
might
have
been
in
collusion
with
Johnston
on
the
fraud
;
;
he
might
be
Mrs.
Meeker's
murderer
or
have
played
some
part
in
her
death
.
This
was
Madden's
suggestion
;
;
the
police
chief
shook
his
head
over
it
.
If
Arthur
Williams
was
involved
in
the
fraud
or
the
murder
,
then
he
too
had
another
identity
.
No
one
the
Medfield
police
had
questioned
professed
to
know
any
more
about
him
than
about
Johnston
.
Scholarship
applicant
?
?
Pauling
looked
doubtful
.
Madden
explained
that
he
was
thinking
of
an
application
sent
directly
to
Mrs.
Meeker
.
Then
he
asked
to
use
the
phone
and
called
Brian
Thayer
,
who
said
that
he
was
just
leaving
to
keep
a
lunch
date
but
would
be
home
by
two
o'clock
.
Madden
said
that
he
would
see
him
at
two
and
made
another
call
,
this
one
to
Mrs.
Meeker's
lawyers
.
Mr.
Hohlbein
was
out
for
the
day
,
but
Mr.
Garth
would
be
free
at
one-thirty
.
The
secretary's
tone
indicated
that
an
appointment
at
such
short
notice
was
a
concession
for
which
Madden
should
be
duly
grateful
.
He
inferred
that
Hohlbein
and
Garth
were
high-priced
lawyers
.
He
had
lunch
with
Pauling
.
Promptly
at
one-thirty
he
entered
Hohlbein
and
Garth's
elegant
suite
of
offices
in
Medfield's
newest
professional
building
.
He
disliked
Garth
on
sight
,
conservative
clothes
and
haircut
,
smile
a
shade
too
earnestly
boyish
for
a
man
who
must
be
well
into
his
thirties
,
handclasp
too
consciously
quick
and
firm
.
Youngish
man
on
the
make
,
Madden
labeled
him
,
and
was
ready
to
guess
that
in
a
correct
,
not
too
pushing
fashion
,
the
junior
partner
of
the
firm
had
political
ambitions
;
;
that
Mrs.
Garth
would
be
impeccably
suitable
as
the
wife
of
a
rising
young
lawyer
;
;
that
there
were
three
children
,
two
boys
and
a
girl
;
;
that
she
was
active
in
the
Woman's
Club
and
he
in
Lions
,
Rotary
,
and
Jaycee
;
;
and
finally
,
that
neither
of
them
had
harbored
an
unorthodox
opinion
since
their
wedding
day
.
Madden
knew
that
he
could
be
completely
wrong
about
all
this
,
but
also
knew
that
he
would
go
right
on
disliking
Garth
.
Garth
was
prepared
to
be
helpful
in
what
he
referred
to
with
fastidious
distaste
as
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
,
which
would
not
,
he
said
more
than
once
,
have
ever
come
about
if
Mrs.
Meeker
had
only
seen
fit
to
consult
Mr.
Hohlbein
or
him
about
it
.
Madden
regretted
not
being
able
to
find
fault
with
so
true
a
statement
.
He
asked
to
see
a
copy
of
Mrs.
Meeker's
will
.
Garth
brought
one
out
.
The
date
,
October
8
,
1957
,
immediately
caught
the
inspector's
eye
.
``
Fairly
recent
''
,
he
remarked
.
``
Was
she
in
the
habit
of
making
new
wills
''
?
?
``
Oh
no
.
She
had
reason
to
change
the
one
she
made
right
after
Mr.
Meeker's
death
.
Her
estate
had
grown
considerably
.
She
wanted
to
make
a
more
equitable
distribution
of
it
among
the
groups
that
would
benefit
the
most
;
;
particularly
the
scholarship
fund
.
At
the
time
the
will
was
drawn
Mr.
Hohlbein
mentioned
to
me
how
mentally
alert
she
seemed
for
her
age
,
knowing
just
what
changes
she
wanted
made
and
so
forth
''
.
Garth
hesitated
.
``
Mr.
Hohlbein
and
I
have
noticed
some
lapses
since
,
though
.
Most
of
them
this
past
year
,
I'd
say
.
Even
two
or
three
years
ago
I
doubt
that
she'd
have
become
involved
in
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.
She'd
have
consulted
us
,
you
see
.
She
always
did
before
,
and
showed
the
utmost
confidence
in
whatever
we
advised
''
.
The
inspector
nodded
,
doubting
this
.
Mrs.
Meeker
hadn't
struck
him
as
ready
to
seek
anyone's
advice
,
least
of
all
Garth's
.
With
her
sharp
tongue
she'd
have
cut
his
pompousness
to
ribbons
.
It
would
have
been
Hohlbein
who
handled
her
affairs
.
Madden
settled
back
to
read
the
will
.
He
skimmed
over
the
millions
that
went
to
Meeker
Park
,
Medfield
Hospital
,
the
civic
center
,
the
Public
Health
Nursing
Association
,
the
library
,
and
so
on
,
pausing
when
he
came
to
the
scholarship
fund
.
Two
millions
were
added
to
what
had
been
set
aside
for
it
in
Mrs.
Meeker's
lifetime
,
and
the
proviso
made
that
as
long
as
Brian
Thayer
continued
to
discharge
his
duties
as
administrator
of
the
fund
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
board
of
trustees
(
hereinafter
appointed
by
the
bank
administering
the
estate
)
he
was
to
be
retained
in
his
present
capacity
at
a
salary
commensurate
with
the
increased
responsibilities
enlargement
of
the
fund
would
entail
.
A
splendid
vote
of
confidence
in
Thayer
,
Madden
reflected
.
Tenure
,
too
.
Very
nice
for
him
.
He
went
on
to
personal
bequests
,
a
list
of
names
largely
unknown
to
him
.
Twenty-five
thousand
to
each
of
the
great-nieces
in
Oregon
(
not
much
to
blood
relatives
out
of
millions
)
ten
thousand
to
this
friend
and
that
,
five
thousand
to
another
;
;
to
Brian
Thayer
,
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
;
;
to
the
Pecks
,
ten
thousand
each
;
;
to
Joan
Sheldon
the
conditional
bequest
of
ten
thousand
to
be
paid
to
her
in
the
event
that
she
was
still
in
Mrs.
Meeker's
employ
at
the
time
of
the
latter's
death
.
(
No
additional
five
thousand
for
each
year
after
Joan's
twenty-first
birthday
;
;
Mrs.
Meeker
hadn't
got
around
to
taking
care
of
that
.
)
Too
bad
,
Madden
thought
.
Joan
Sheldon
had
earned
the
larger
bequest
.
Mr.
Hohlbein
was
left
twenty
thousand
,
Garth
ten
.
There
were
no
other
names
Madden
recognized
.
Arthur
Williams's
might
well
have
been
included
,
he
felt
.
Mrs.
Meeker
had
spent
a
small
fortune
on
a
search
for
him
but
had
made
no
provision
for
him
in
her
will
if
he
should
be
found
after
her
death
,
and
had
never
mentioned
his
name
to
her
lawyers
.
Madden
took
up
this
point
with
Garth
,
who
shrugged
it
off
.
``
Old
people
have
their
idiosyncrasies
''
.
``
This
one
came
a
bit
high
at
thirty
thousand
or
more
.
``
Well
,
she
had
a
number
of
them
where
money
was
concerned
''
,
Garth
said
.
``
Sometimes
we'd
have
trouble
persuading
her
to
make
tax-exempt
charitable
contributions
,
and
I've
known
her
to
quarrel
with
a
plumber
over
a
bill
for
fixing
a
faucet
;
;
the
next
moment
she'd
put
another
half
million
into
the
scholarship
fund
or
thirty
thousand
into
something
as
impractical
as
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.
There
was
no
telling
how
she'd
react
to
spending
money
''
.
Madden
inquired
next
about
the
audit
of
the
scholarship
fund
.
There
was
an
annual
audit
,
Garth
informed
him
.
No
discrepancies
or
shortages
had
ever
been
found
.
Brian
Thayer
was
a
thoroughly
honest
and
competent
administrator
.
His
salary
had
reached
the
ten
thousand
mark
.
His
expenses
ran
another
four
or
five
thousand
.
The
lawyer
didn't
know
him
very
well
although
he
saw
him
occasionally
at
some
dinner
party
--
Thayer
,
like
himself
,
Madden
reflected
,
was
the
extra
man
so
prized
by
hostesses
--
and
found
him
easy
enough
to
talk
to
.
But
he
didn't
play
golf
,
didn't
seem
to
belong
to
any
local
clubs
--
his
work
took
him
away
a
lot
,
of
course
--
which
probably
accounted
for
his
tendency
to
keep
to
himself
.
Garth's
glance
began
to
flicker
to
his
watch
.
He
said
that
he
had
already
told
the
police
chief
that
he
didn't
know
what
insurance
man
had
recommended
Johnston
to
Mrs.
Meeker
.
He
would
offer
no
theory
to
account
for
her
murder
.
The
whole
thing
,
his
manner
conveyed
,
was
so
far
outside
the
normal
routine
of
Hohlbein
and
Garth
that
it
practically
demanded
being
swept
under
the
rug
.
No
doubt
Mrs.
Meeker
had
snubbed
him
many
a
time
and
he
felt
no
grief
over
her
passing
.
Even
so
,
Madden's
dislike
of
the
suave
,
correct
lawyer
deepened
.
It
would
be
all
right
with
him
,
he
decided
,
if
his
investigation
of
the
fraud
,
with
its
probable
by-product
of
murder
,
led
to
Garth's
door
.
Motive
?
?
Ten-thousand-dollar
bequest
.
At
first
glance
,
not
much
of
a
motive
for
a
man
of
his
standing
;
;
but
for
all
his
air
of
affluence
,
who
could
tell
what
his
private
financial
picture
was
?
?
The
inspector
knew
as
he
left
that
this
was
wishful
thinking
.
Nevertheless
,
he
made
a
mental
note
to
look
into
Garth's
financial
background
.
Brian
Thayer
had
a
downtown
address
.
He
lived
in
an
apartment
house
not
over
three
or
four
years
old
,
a
reclaimed
island
of
landscaped
brick
and
glass
on
the
fringe
of
the
business
district
.
He
occupied
a
two-bedroom
apartment
on
the
fourth
floor
,
using
the
second
bedroom
as
his
office
.
Airy
and
bright
,
the
apartment
was
furnished
with
good
modern
furniture
,
rugs
,
and
draperies
.
Done
by
a
professional
decorator
,
Madden
thought
,
and
somehow
as
impersonal
,
as
unremarkable
as
its
occupant
.
In
Dunston
the
rent
would
run
close
to
two
hundred
a
month
;
;
in
Medfield
,
perhaps
twenty-five
less
,
not
all
of
it
paid
by
Thayer
,
who
could
charge
off
one
room
on
his
expense
account
.
He
took
Madden
into
the
room
he
used
as
an
office
.
It
contained
a
desk
,
files
,
a
typewriter
on
a
stand
,
and
two
big
leather
armchairs
.
A
newspaper
open
at
stock-market
reports
lay
on
one
of
them
.
Thayer
folded
it
up
and
offered
a
drink
.
The
inspector
declined
.
To
begin
the
interview
,
he
asked
if
Thayer
,
with
more
time
to
think
it
over
,
could
add
to
what
he
had
said
the
other
day
about
Johnston
.
Thayer
shook
his
head
.
``
It's
all
I
think
about
,
too
.
That
and
her
death
.
It's
still
unbelievable
that
it
was
murder
.
For
all
her
domineering
ways
,
I
can't
conceive
of
her
having
had
a
deadly
enemy
''
.
``
Dammit
,
Phil
,
are
you
trying
to
wreck
my
career
?
?
Because
that's
what
you're
doing
--
wrecking
it
,
wrecking
it
,
wrecking
it
''
!
!
Griffith
had
confronted
Hoag
on
the
building's
front
steps
--
Hoag
had
been
permitted
no
further
--
and
backed
him
against
a
wrought-iron
railing
.
His
rage
had
built
up
as
he
made
his
way
here
from
the
second
floor
,
helped
by
the
quantity
of
champagne
he
had
consumed
.
Hoag
said
,
``
I
didn't
send
for
you
,
Leigh
.
I
want
the
captain
in
charge
.
Where
is
he

?

``

,
for
God's
sake
,
go
away
.
The
undersecretary's
in
there
.
I
told
you
there's
nothing
between
Midge
and
me
,
nothing
.
It's
all
in
your
mind
''
.
A
couple
of
sobs
escaped
him
,
followed
by
a
sentiment
that
revealed
his
emotional
state
.
``
Why
,
I'm
not
fit
to
touch
the
hem
of
her
garment
''
.
``
Leigh
,
get
a
grip
on
yourself
.
It's
not
about
you
or
Midge
.
I
have
some
security
information
about
the
prime
minister
''
.
Griffith
looked
at
him
suspiciously
through
red-rimmed
eyes
.
``
Not
about
me
?
?
You
mean
it
,
Phil
?
?
You
wouldn't
pull
my
leg
,
old
man
?
?
I
did
get
you
on
the
platform
this
morning
''
.
``
I'm
not
pulling
your
leg
.
Will
you
call
that
captain
''
?
?
``
No
use
,
he
won't
come
''
.
He
peered
closely
at
Hoag
in
the
gathering
darkness
.
``
What
happened
to
your
head
''
?
?
``
I
was
hit
--
knocked
out
.
Now
will
you
get
him
''
?
?
``
He
says
I'm
to
take
the
message
''
.
He
stared
at
Hoag
drunkenly
.
``
Who'd
hit
you
in
the
head
''
?
?
``
It
doesn't
matter
.
You
get
back
to
the
captain
and
tell
him
this
:
Somebody's
going
to
take
a
shot
at
the
prime
minister
,
and
Mahzeer
is
in
on
the
plot
.
Tell
him
under
no
circumstances
to
trust
the
prime
minister
with
Mahzeer
''
.
Griffith
said
,
``
That's
impossible
.
Mahzeer's
the
ambassador
''
.
``
Nevertheless
it's
true
''
.
``
Impossible
''
.
Griffith
was
trying
to
clear
his
head
of
the
champagne
fuzz
that
encased
it
.
``
I'll
show
you
how
wrong
you
are
.
Mahzeer
and
the
prime
minister
are
alone
right
now
''
.
He
nodded
triumphantly
.
``
So
that
proves
it
''
!
!
Hoag
looked
terrified
.
``
Where
are
they
''
?
?
``
Where'd
you
expect
,
the
john
?
?
Mahzeer's
office
''
.
``
Where
is
that
''
?
?
``
Facing
us
,
two
flights
up
.
Look
,
old
man
,
you
can't
go
up
.
They
won't
even
let
you
in
the
front
door
.
So
why
don't
you
be
a
good
boy
and
''
--
Hoag
grabbed
him
by
the
shoulders
.
``
Listen
to
me
,
Leigh
.
If
you
want
to
spend
another
day
in
the
State
Department
--
another
day
--
you
get
in
there
and
tell
that
captain
what
I
told
you
''
.
He
bit
out
the
words
.
``
And
you
know
I
can
do
it
''
.
Griffith
raised
placating
hands
.
``
Easy
does
it
,
Phil
.
I
was
just
going
.
I'm
on
my
way
''
.
He
turned
and
fled
into
the
house
and
made
his
way
up
the
marble
stairs
without
once
looking
back
.
On
the
second
landing
he
paused
to
look
for
Docherty
,
didn't
see
him
,
and
accepted
a
glass
of
champagne
.
He
took
several
large
swallows
,
recollected
that
Docherty
had
gone
up
another
flight
,
and
decided
he
would
be
wise
to
cover
himself
by
finding
him
.
The
way
Hoag
was
,
no
telling
what
he
might
say
or
do
.
He
finished
his
champagne
and
climbed
uncertainly
to
the
next
landing
.
At
the
top
a
uniformed
officer
blocked
further
progress
.
``
Yes
,
what
is
it
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
I
want
Captain
Docherty
''
.
He
spotted
Docherty
coming
out
of
a
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
called
to
him
.
Docherty
said
,
``
It's
okay
,
Bonfiglio
,
let
him
by
''
.
They
walked
toward
each
other
.
``
Well
''
?
?
Griffith
said
,
``
Hoag
told
me
to
tell
you
''
--
he
waited
until
they
were
close
;
;
it
was
hideously
embarrassing
--
``
not
to
let
the
prime
minister
be
alone
with
Mahzeer
''
.
Griffith
looked
half-crocked
to
the
captain
;
;
it
would
be
just
like
him
.
``
Why
not
''
?
?
``
He
claims
Mahzeer's
in
a
plot
to
kill
the
P.M.
''
.
Docherty
went
taut
:
was
it
possible
?
?
Could
the
ambassador
himself
be
the
man
on
this
side
the
prime
minister
feared
?
?
Not
possible
,
he
thought
;
;
the
prime
minister
knew
who
his
enemy
was
here
;
;
he
wasn't
going
to
allow
himself
to
be
led
meekly
to
the
slaughter
.
And
if
by
some
wild
chance
Mahzeer
was
the
man
,
he
wouldn't
dare
try
anything
now
--
not
after
Docherty
had
looked
in
on
the
two
of
them
to
see
that
all
was
well
.
Docherty
was
damned
if
he
would
make
a
fool
of
himself
again
the
way
he
had
earlier
over
the
laundry
truck
.
One
more
muddleheaded
play
like
that
one
and
they'd
be
leading
him
away
.
Still
,
this
had
to
be
checked
out
.
``
Where'd
your
friend
Hoag
get
his
information
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
Haven't
the
faintest
,
Captain
''
.
``
Would
you
mind
sending
him
up
here
?
?
I'd
like
to
talk
to
him
''
.
Troubled
,
he
continued
along
the
corridor
,
poking
his
head
into
the
next
office
for
a
careful
look
around
.
But
Hoag
had
not
stayed
on
the
front
steps
when
Griffith
disappeared
into
the
building
.
He
was
unwilling
to
rely
on
Griffith's
carrying
his
message
,
and
he
had
no
confidence
the
police
would
act
on
it
.
If
Mahzeer
was
alone
with
the
prime
minister
he
could
be
arranging
his
execution
while
Hoag
stood
out
here
shivering
in
the
darkening
street
.
He
would
have
to
do
something
on
his
own
.
But
what
?
?
The
door
opened
and
three
men
and
a
woman
in
a
sari
swept
past
him
and
down
the
stairs
.
In
the
lighted
interior
he
saw
other
men
and
women
struggling
into
their
wraps
.
These
were
the
early
departures
;
;
in
half
an
hour
the
reception
would
be
over
.
If
Mahzeer
was
planning
to
set
up
the
prime
minister
for
Muller
he
would
have
to
do
it
in
the
next
few
minutes
.
Hoag
descended
the
stone
steps
to
the
street
and
looked
up
at
the
building
.
Wide
windows
with
many
small
leaded
panes
swept
across
the
upper
stories
.
On
the
second
floor
he
saw
the
animated
faces
of
the
party
guests
;
;
the
scene
looked
like
a
Christmas
card
.
On
the
third
floor
one
of
the
two
windows
was
lighted
;
;
it
was
framed
in
maroon
drapes
,
and
no
faces
were
visible
.
This
would
be
Mahzeer's
office
.
He
and
the
prime
minister
would
be
back
from
the
window
,
seated
at
Mahzeer's
desk
;
;
they
would
be
going
over
papers
Mahzeer
had
saved
as
excuse
for
just
such
a
meeting
.
In
a
minute
,
or
five
minutes
,
the
business
would
be
done
;
;
Mahzeer
would
stand
up
,
the
prime
minister
would
follow
.
Mahzeer
would
direct
the
prime
minister's
attention
to
something
out
the
window
and
would
guide
him
forward
and
then
step
to
one
side
.
The
single
shot
would
come
;
;
Hoag
would
carry
its
sound
to
his
grave
.
Mahzeer
,
of
course
,
would
be
desolate
.
How
was
he
to
suspect
that
an
assassin
had
been
lurking
somewhere
across
the
street
waiting
for
just
such
a
chance
?
?
Hoag
turned
.
Where
across
the
street
?
?
Where
was
Muller
waiting
with
the
rifle
?
?
Narrow
four-story
buildings
ran
the
length
of
the
block
like
books
tightly
packed
on
a
shelf
.
Most
of
them
could
be
eliminated
;
;
Muller's
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
half
dozen
almost
directly
opposite
.
The
legation
was
generously
set
back
from
the
building
line
;
;
if
the
angle
of
fire
were
too
great
the
jutting
buildings
on
either
side
would
interfere
.
Would
the
shot
come
from
a
roof
?
?
He
ran
his
eye
along
the
roof
copings
;
;
almost
at
once
a
figure
bulked
up
.
But
dully
glinting
on
the
dark
form
were
the
buttons
and
badge
of
a
policeman
.
With
a
cop
patrolling
the
road
Muller
would
have
to
be
inside
a
building
--
if
he
was
here
at
all
,
and
not
waiting
for
the
prime
minister
somewhere
between
this
street
and
the
terminal
building
at
La
Guardia
Airport
.
Hoag
crossed
the
narrow
street
,
squeezing
between
parked
cars
to
reach
the
sidewalk
.
From
this
side
he
could
see
farther
into
the
legation's
third-story
window
,
but
he
saw
no
faces
;
;
the
room's
occupants
were
still
seated
or
they
had
been
called
into
the
hallway
by
an
alarmed
police
captain
.
If
only
the
latter
were
true
.
He
walked
rapidly
along
the
buildings
scanning
their
facades
:
one
was
a
club
--
that
was
out
;
;
two
others
he
ruled
out
because
all
their
windows
were
lighted
.
That
left
three
,
possibly
four
,
one
looking
much
like
the
next
.
He
climbed
the
steps
of
the
first
and
opened
the
door
to
the
vestibule
.
He
quickly
closed
it
again
.
He
had
assumed
that
all
these
buildings
had
been
divided
into
apartments
,
but
this
one
,
from
a
glance
at
the
hall
furnishings
,
was
obviously
still
a
functioning
town
house
,
and
its
owners
were
in
residence
;
;
that
made
it
doubtful
as
the
hiding
place
of
a
man
whose
plans
had
to
be
made
in
advance
.
He
went
on
to
the
next
building
and
found
what
he
expected
--
the
mingled
cooking
aromas
of
a
public
vestibule
.
On
one
wall
was
the
brass
front
of
a
row
of
mailboxes
;
;
there
were
six
apartments
.
Now
what
?
?
The
names
on
the
mailboxes
meant
nothing
to
him
.
This
was
senseless
--
he
had
no
idea
what
to
look
for
.
He
peered
in
the
boxes
themselves
;
;
all
were
empty
except
one
,
and
that
one
was
jammed
with
letters
and
magazines
.
The
occupants
of
Apartment
Number
3
were
probably
away
for
a
few
days
,
and
not
likely
to
return
on
a
Friday
.
Had
Muller
made
the
same
deduction
?
?
Muller
was
attracted
to
the
lore
of
mailboxes
.
He
opened
the
inner
door
;
;
the
cooking
odors
were
stronger
--
all
over
the
city
,
at
this
hour
,
housewives
would
be
fussing
over
stoves
.
He
climbed
,
as
quickly
as
he
could
urge
his
body
,
up
the
two
unbroken
flights
to
the
third
floor
,
pulling
himself
along
on
a
delicate
balustrade
,
all
that
remained
of
the
building's
beauty
.
He
paused
on
the
landing
to
steady
his
breathing
and
then
bent
to
examine
the
single
door
by
the
light
of
the
weak
bulb
overhead
.
Now
he
was
certain
:
the
lock
had
not
yielded
to
Muller's
collection
of
keys
;
;
fresh
scars
showed
that
the
door
had
been
prized
open
.
It
had
been
shut
again
,
but
the
lock
was
broken
;
;
he
noted
with
a
thrill
of
fear
that
the
door
moved
under
his
touch
.
What
was
he
to
do
now
?
?
He
had
thought
no
further
than
finding
Muller
.
He
realized
now
he
had
more
than
half
hoped
he
wouldn't
find
him
--
that
Muller
would
not
be
here
,
that
the
attempt
would
be
scheduled
for
somewhere
beyond
Hoag's
control
.
He
could
not
break
in
on
an
armed
man
.
He
would
have
to
climb
back
down
to
the
street
and
signal
a
cop
.
Was
there
time
?
?
His
thoughts
were
scattered
by
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
.
Hoag
pushed
open
the
door
:
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
dark
room
Muller
was
faintly
silhouetted
against
the
window
,
the
rifle
still
raised
;
;
he
stood
with
his
feet
apart
on
a
kitchen
table
he
had
dragged
to
the
sill
.
He
turned
his
head
to
the
source
of
the
disturbance
and
instantly
back
to
the
window
and
his
rifle
sight
,
dismissing
Hoag
for
the
moment
with
the
same
contempt
he
had
shown
in
their
encounter
at
Hoag's
apartment
.
Hoag
stretched
his
left
hand
to
the
wall
and
fumbled
for
the
switch
:
evil
flourishes
in
the
dark
.
The
room
was
bathed
in
light
at
the
instant
Muller's
second
shot
came
.
Muller
,
nakedly
exposed
at
the
bright
window
like
a
deer
pinned
in
a
car's
headlights
,
threw
down
the
rifle
and
turned
to
jump
from
the
table
;
;
his
face
wore
a
look
of
outrage
.
A
shot
caught
him
and
straightened
him
up
in
screaming
pain
;
;
a
following
volley
of
shots
shattered
glass
,
ripped
the
ceiling
,
and
sent
him
lurching
heavily
from
the
table
.
He
was
dead
before
his
body
made
contact
with
the
floor
.
Hoag
stumbled
back
into
the
hall
,
leaned
against
the
wall
,
and
started
to
retch
.
After
Captain
Docherty
sent
Arleigh
Griffith
for
Hoag
he
was
able
to
complete
his
detailed
inspection
of
the
third
floor
and
to
receive
a
report
from
his
man
covering
the
floors
above
before
Griffith
returned
,
buoyed
up
by
a
brief
stop
for
another
glass
of
champagne
.
The
safe
at
Ingleside
District
Station
stands
next
to
the
gum
machine
in
a
narrow
passageway
that
leads
to
Captain
Harris's
office
(
to
the
left
)
,
the
lieutenant's
office
(
farther
along
and
to
the
left
)
and
the
janitor's
supply
closet
(
straight
ahead
)
.
The
safe
is
a
repository
for
three
dead
flashlight
batteries
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
unused
left-hand
fingerprint
cards
,
a
stack
of
unsold
Policemen's
Ball
tickets
from
last
year
,
and
thirty-seven
cents
in
coins
and
stamps
.
Gun
set
the
captain's
fifth
of
Hiram
Walker
inside
the
safe
before
he
reported
to
Lt.
Killpath
,
though
he
knew
that
Killpath's
ulcer
prevented
him
from
making
any
untoward
incursion
on
Herman
Wolff's
gift
.
It
was
more
a
matter
of
tact
,
and
also
it
was
none
of
Killpath's
goddam
business
.
He
walked
up
to
the
lieutenant's
office
,
leaned
wearily
against
the
gun
rack
that
housed
four
rifles
and
a
gas
gun
nobody
remembered
having
used
and
a
submachine
gun
that
was
occasionally
tried
out
on
the
Academy
Range
.
He
stared
at
the
clerk
who
sat
at
a
scarred
and
ancient
fumed-oak
desk
stuffing
envelopes
.
``
Where's
the
Lieut
''
?
?
The
clerk
wagged
his
head
toward
the
captain's
office
.
Gun
went
to
the
connecting
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
stood
at
attention
while
Orville
Torrence
Killpath
,
in
full
uniform
,
finished
combing
his
hair
.
The
lieutenant's
sparse
brown
hair
was
heavily
pomaded
,
and
as
Killpath
raked
the
comb
through
it
,
it
stuck
together
in
thatches
so
that
it
looked
like
umbrella
ribs
clinging
to
his
pink
skull
.
The
lieutenant
eyed
Gun's
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
washbowl
and
then
glanced
back
at
his
own
face
,
moving
the
comb
methodically
around
his
head
.
Leave
me
alone
,
Gun
thought
.
Fight
with
Sam
Schaeffer
,
fight
with
the
whole
damned
Bureau
.
But
leave
me
alone
.
Because
I'm
looking
for
the
son
of
a
bitch
that
killed
that
old
man
,
and
I'm
going
to
get
him
.
If
you
just
leave
me
to
hell
alone
,
Lieutenant
.
Killpath
peered
through
half-closed
lids
at
his
reflection
,
thrust
up
his
chin
in
a
gesture
of
satisfaction
and
about-faced
.
Gun
waited
for
Killpath
to
sit
down
behind
the
desk
near
the
window
.
He
sat
stiff-backed
in
a
chair
that
did
not
swivel
,
though
it
was
obvious
to
Gun
that
Killpath
felt
his
position
as
acting
captain
plainly
merited
a
swivel
chair
.
The
desk
before
him
was
in
no
better
repair
than
the
rest
of
the
furniture
crowded
into
the
room
,
including
wooden
file
cabinets
with
some
of
their
pulls
yanked
off
and
a
wardrobe
stained
with
the
roof
seepage
of
countless
seasons
.
Killpath
pulled
one
thin
leg
up
,
clamping
his
arms
around
the
shinbone
to
press
his
knee
into
an
incredibly
scrawny
gut
.
It
was
the
posture
which
the
men
had
come
to
recognize
as
that
of
Killpath
defying
his
ulcer
.
He
put
his
chin
on
his
kneecap
,
stretching
his
neck
like
that
of
a
turkey
on
a
chopping
block
,
and
stared
wordlessly
at
his
sergeant
.
Gun
waited
.
The
7:45
bell
rang
and
he
could
hear
the
outside
doors
bang
shut
,
closing
in
the
assembled
day
watch
.
Finally
,
Orville
intoned
through
his
hawk
nose
,
``
We
can't
have
people
running
in
any
time
they
please
,
Sergeant
''
.
``
No
,
sir
''
.
``
Running
in
,
running
out
.
Can't
have
it
.
Makes
for
confusion
and
congestion
''
.
He
rocked
back
in
the
chair
,
knee
locked
against
stomach
,
his
beady
eyes
fixed
on
Matson
.
He
was
silent
again
,
possibly
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
squadroom
.
Roll
was
being
called
.
Gun
cleared
his
throat
.
Killpath
said
,
``
You
were
expected
to
report
to
my
office
twenty
minutes
ago
,
Sergeant
.
That's
not
getting
all
the
juice
out
of
the
orange
,
now
is
it
''
?
?
``
No
,
sir
''
.
Then
Killpath
smiled
.
Gun
knew
that
nothing
but
aces
back
to
back
would
give
the
lieutenant
an
ulcer
and
a
smile
at
the
same
time
.
The
day-watch
platoon
commander
,
Lt.
Rinker
,
was
calling
out
the
beat
assignments
,
but
Matson
couldn't
make
the
names
mean
anything
.
``
I
called
the
station
at
three
this
morning
''
,
Killpath's
nasal
voice
pronounced
.
``
Do
you
have
any
idea
who
might
have
been
in
charge
at
the
time
''
?
?
``
Sergeant
Vaughn
,
sir
''
.
``
Now
,
now
,
you're
just
guessing
,
Sergeant
''
.
He
smiled
thinly
,
savoring
his
joke
.
``
What
if
I
said
nobody
was
here
but
a
couple
of
patrolmen
''
?
?
``
Sir
,
Vaughn
knows
better
than
to
leave
the
station
without
a
relief
.
He
must
have
''
--
``
He
let
a
patrolman
take
over
the
duties
of
the
station
keeper
.
Now
that's
not
regulation
,
is
it
''
?
?
``
No
,
sir
''
.
``
But
you
didn't
know
a
thing
about
it
,
did
you
''
?
?
Killpath
leaned
forward
;
;
his
foot
slipped
off
the
chair
and
he
put
it
back
again
,
frowning
now
.
``
That's
not
taking
one's
command
with
a
responsible
attitude
,
Matson
''
.
Gun
told
himself
that
the
old
bastard
was
a
fool
.
But
stupidity
was
no
consolation
when
it
had
rank
.
``
I
was
out
in
the
district
,
sir
''
.
``
Oh
,
yes
.
So
I
have
heard
''
.
He
stretched
a
pale
hand
out
to
the
scattered
papers
on
his
desk
.
``
I
might
point
out
that
your
inability
to
report
to
my
office
this
morning
when
you
were
instructed
to
do
so
has
not
ah
limited
my
knowledge
of
your
activities
as
you
may
have
hoped
''
.
He
took
up
a
white
sheet
of
paper
,
dark
with
single-spaced
data
.
A
car
pulled
into
the
driveway
outside
the
window
.
Gun
knew
it
was
Car
12
,
the
wagon
,
returned
from
delivering
Ingleside's
drunk-and-disorderlies
to
the
City
Jail
.
But
for
some
fool
reason
he
couldn't
remember
which
men
he'd
put
on
the
transfer
detail
.
He
stared
at
the
report
in
Killpath's
hand
,
sure
it
was
written
by
Accacia
--
just
as
sure
as
if
he'd
submitted
it
in
his
scrawled
longhand
.
He
sucked
in
his
breath
and
kept
quiet
while
Killpath
laid
down
the
sheet
again
,
wound
the
gold-wire
stems
of
his
glasses
around
his
ears
and
then
,
eying
the
report
as
it
lay
before
him
on
the
desk
,
intoned
,
``

he
leaned
back
and
peeled
off
his
glasses
``

to
co-operate

Acting
Captain

returning
promptly
when
so

What
have
you
to
say
to
that
,
Sergeant
''
?
?
Killpath
sailed
the
paper
across
the
desk
,
but
Matson
didn't
pick
it
up
or
even
glance
at
it
.
``
Well
''
?
?
``
I
didn't
think
Accacia
knew
so
many
big
words
,
Lieutenant
''
.
Killpath
licked
his
lips
.
``
Patrolman
Accacia
is
an
alert
and
conscientious
law-enforcement
officer
.
I
don't
think
his
diligence
mitigates
your
negligence

Matson
''
.
``
Negligence
,
hell
''
!
!
Gun
held
his
breath
a
moment
,
pushing
the
volume
and
pitch
of
his
voice
down
under
the
trapdoor
in
his
throat
.
``
Sir
.
I
would
have
been
negligent
and
a
goddam
lousy
cop
to
boot
,
if
I'd
sat
around
this
station
all
night
when
somebody
got
away
with
murder
in
my
district
.
It's
too
bad
I
didn't
call
you
,
and
it's
too
bad
I
let
Schaeffer
use
Accacia
when
he
could
have
had
a
boy
who'd
be
glad
to
learn
something
of
Homicide
procedure
.
But
I'm
not
one
damned
bit
sorry
I
went
out
to
question
the
people
I
know
in
the
places
they
hang
around
,
and
''
--
``
Let's
not
push
our
patience
beyond
the
danger
line
,
Sergeant
''
,
Killpath
nasaled
.
``
I
shouldn't
like
to
have
to
write
you
up
for
insubordination
as
well
as
dereliction
of
duty
''
.
Gun
stiffened
,
his
hands
balling
into
fists
at
his
sides
.
He
clamped
his
jaws
to
keep
the
fury
from
spilling
out
.
An
argument
with
Orville
Torrence
Killpath
was
as
frustrating
and
as
futile
as
a
cap
pistol
on
a
firing
range
.
Killpath
leaned
forward
again
,
rocked
comfortably
with
his
arms
still
wrapped
around
one
knee
.
``
Let's
just
remember
,
Sergeant
,
that
we
must
all
carry
our
own
umbrella
.
A
district
station
can't
run
smoothly
,
unless
''
--
He
interrupted
himself
,
looking
around
Gun
at
the
doorway
.
``
Morning
,
Lieutenant
Rinker
''
.
``
Sorry
,
Orville
.
I
thought
you
hadn't
come
in
yet
''
.
``
I've
been
here
for
some
time
''
.
He
stood
up
,
cocked
his
head
and
eyed
Gun
coldly
.
``
The
sergeant
is
just
leaving
''
.
It
had
come
as
no
great
surprise
to
Matson
that
the
hot
water
in
the
showers
didn't
work
,
that
Loren
Severe
had
thrown
up
all
over
the
stairs
,
or
that
some
thieving
bastard
of
a
cop
had
walked
off
with
his
cigarettes
.
It
was
the
best
he
could
hope
for
on
a
watch
that
had
ended
with
a
session
in
Killpath's
office
.
Now
,
as
he
passed
the
open
counter
that
divided
the
assembly
room
from
the
business
office
,
he
nodded
and
said
good
night
to
the
station
keeper
and
his
clerks
,
not
stopping
to
hear
the
day-watch
playback
of
his
chewing
out
.
Not
that
he
gave
a
damn
what
the
grapevine
sent
out
about
Killpath's
little
speech
on
the
comportment
of
platoon
commanders
.
He
just
didn't
want
to
talk
about
it
.
If
the
acting
captain
wanted
his
acting
lieutenant
to
sit
on
his
ass
around
the
station
all
night
,
Killpath
would
just
have
to
go
out
and
drag
Gun
back
by
the
heels
once
an
hour
;
;
because
he'd
be
damned
if
he
was
going
to
be
a
mid-watch
pencil-pusher
just
to
please
his
ulcerated
pro-tem
captain
.
At
the
doorway
he
squinted
up
at
the
gray
morning
overcast
and
patted
his
jacket
pockets
for
the
cigarettes
,
remembering
then
that
he'd
left
them
at
the
Doughnuttery
.
He
could
pick
up
another
pack
on
his
way
home
,
if
he
were
going
home
.
But
even
before
he
started
across
the
oiled
road
to
his
Plymouth
,
parked
in
the
lot
under
the
cypress
trees
across
from
the
station
,
he
knew
that
he
wasn't
going
home
.
Not
yet
.
It
was
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
:
the
hour
which
,
like
a
spade
turning
clods
of
earth
,
exposed
to
the
day
a
myriad
of
busy
creatures
that
had
lain
dormant
in
the
quiet
night
.
Mission
Street
at
this
hour
was
populated
by
a
whole
community
that
Gun
could
not
have
seen
on
his
tour
of
duty
--
the
neighborhood
that
had
known
Urbano
Quintana
by
day
.
Then
Sol
Phillips
had
purchased
the
Alliance
Furniture
Mart
seventeen
years
ago
.
It
was
professedly
worth
three
thousand
dollars
in
stock
and
good
will
,
and
the
name
was
written
in
gold
in
foot-high
letters
across
each
of
the
two
display
windows
.
On
the
right
window
,
at
eye
level
,
in
smaller
print
but
also
in
gold
,
was
Gonzalez
,
Prop.
,
and
under
that
,
Se
Habla
Espanol
.
Mr.
Phillips
took
a
razor
to
Gonzalez
,
Prop.
,
but
left
the
promise
that
Spanish
would
be
understood
because
he
thought
it
meant
that
Spanish
clientele
would
be
welcome
.
Language
was
no
problem
anyway
;
;
Mr.
Phillips
had
only
to
signal
from
his
doorway
to
summon
aid
from
the
ubiquitous
bilingual
children
who
played
on
the
sidewalks
of
Mission
Street
.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
business
was
slow
this
time
of
year
and
his
one
salesgirl
was
not
the
most
enterprising
,
Mr.
Phillips
had
no
worries
at
all
,
and
he
said
as
much
to
Gun
Matson
,
who
sat
across
from
him
in
civilian
clothes
,
on
a
Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed
,
mauve
velour
,
$79.89
nothing-down
special
!
!
``
She's
honest
as
the
day
''
,
Mr.
Phillips
said
,
and
added
,
``
Mr.
Gunnar
,
I
can
say
this
to
you
:
Beebe
is
a
little
too
honest
.
You
can't
tell
a
customer
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
him
to
refinance
his
payments
before
he
even
signs
for
a
loan
on
the
money
down
!
!
A
time
plan
is
a
mere
convenience
,
you
understand
,
and
when
''
--
He
interrupted
himself
,
smiling
.
``
I
put
her
in
lamps
.
That
way
I
don't
lose
so
much
''
.
``
Why
don't
you
just
hire
somebody
else
''
?
?
``
She
says
she
has
to
finish
a
story
''
.
He
shrugged
.
``
I
asked
her
why
she
couldn't
do
it
tomorrow
,
but
it
seems
the
muse
is
working
good
tonight
and
she's
afraid
to
let
it
go
''
.
Casey
made
some
comment
,
but
his
mind
was
busy
as
he
considered
the
man
.
His
name
was
George
Needham
and
he
,
too
,
had
come
from
a
good
family
.
He
was
perhaps
thirty-two
,
nicely
set
up
,
with
light
brown
hair
that
had
a
pronounced
wave
.
He
was
always
well
groomed
and
well
tailored
,
and
he
had
that
rich
man's
look
which
was
authentic
enough
and
came
from
two
good
prep
schools
and
a
proper
university
.
An
only
child
,
he
had
done
all
the
things
that
young
men
do
who
have
been
born
to
money
and
social
position
until
his
father
double-crossed
him
by
dying
broke
.
Since
then
he
had
worked
at
this
and
that
,
though
some
said
his
main
interest
was
gambling
.
All
this
went
through
Casey's
mind
in
the
first
instant
,
but
what
held
his
interest
was
the
fact
that
these
two
should
be
together
at
all
.
For
he
had
understood
that
Betty
had
been
engaged
to
a
boy
named
Barry
Jenkins
.
She
had
grown
up
with
young
Jenkins
,
and
he
had
heard
that
they
had
been
at
the
point
of
getting
married
at
least
twice
.
He
wanted
to
ask
her
about
Jenkins
now
,
but
he
knew
he
couldn't
do
so
in
Needham's
presence
.
And
so
,
still
wondering
and
a
little
perplexed
,
he
grinned
at
the
girl
and
spoke
lightly
to
make
sure
that
she
would
know
he
was
kidding
.
``
Where
did
you
pick
him
up
''
?
?
``
Oh
,
I've
known
him
quite
a
while
''
.
She
glanced
at
her
companion
fondly
.
``
Haven't
I
,
George
''
?
?
``
I've
been
after
her
for
years
''
,
Needham
said
,
``
but
I've
never
been
able
to
get
anywhere
until
the
last
few
days
''
.
The
girl's
eyes
were
softly
shining
as
she
reached
out
and
touched
Casey's
hand
.
``
Can
I
tell
you
a
secret
?
?
We're
going
to
get
married
.
Do
you
approve
''
?
?
Casey
kept
his
smile
fixed
,
but
some
small
inner
disturbance
was
working
on
him
as
he
thought
again
about
Needham
,
who
was
eight
or
ten
years
older
than
the
girl
.
He
wondered
whether
Needham
was
going
to
swear
off
gambling
and
get
a
steady
job
or
whether
he
was
counting
on
the
income
from
Betty's
estate
to
subsidize
him
.
None
of
this
showed
in
his
face
,
and
he
tried
to
keep
his
skepticism
in
hand
.
He
made
a
point
of
frowning
,
of
acting
out
the
part
of
the
fond
father-confessor
.
``
I'll
have
to
give
it
some
thought
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
wouldn't
want
me
to
say
yes
without
making
sure
his
intentions
are
honorable
,
would
you
''
?
?
She
made
a
face
at
him
and
then
she
laughed
.
``
Of
course
not
''
.
``
I'll
get
my
references
in
order
''
,
Needham
said
,
and
though
he
spoke
with
a
smile
,
Casey
somehow
got
the
idea
that
he
was
not
particularly
amused
.
``
Stop
by
any
time
,
Casey
''
.
He
stood
up
and
touched
the
girl's
arm
.
``
Come
on
,
darling
.
If
you're
really
serious
about
working
on
that
story
,
I'd
better
take
you
home
''
.
Casey
watched
them
go
,
still
frowning
absently
and
then
dismissing
the
matter
as
he
called
for
his
check
.
As
he
went
out
he
told
Freddie
the
dinner
was
perfect
,
and
when
he
got
his
hat
and
coat
from
Nancy
Parks
and
put
a
fifty-cent
piece
in
the
slot
,
he
told
her
to
be
sure
that
it
went
toward
her
dowry
.
A
taxi
took
him
back
to
the
bar
and
grill
where
he
had
left
his
car
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
a
parking
place
across
the
street
from
his
apartment
.
Because
his
mind
had
been
otherwise
occupied
for
the
past
couple
of
hours
,
he
did
not
think
to
look
and
see
if
Jerry
Burton's
car
was
still
there
.
In
fact
,
he
did
not
think
about
Jerry
Burton
at
all
until
he
entered
his
living
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
Only
then
,
when
his
glance
focused
on
the
divan
and
saw
that
it
was
empty
,
did
he
remember
his
earlier
problem
.
Even
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
neatly
folded
blanket
that
he
had
spread
over
Burton
,
the
pillow
,
the
sheet
of
paper
on
top
of
it
.
Then
he
was
striding
across
the
room
,
his
thoughts
confused
but
the
worry
building
swiftly
inside
him
as
he
snatched
up
the
note
.
Jack
:
Look
in
the
wastebasket
.
I
knew
the
only
way
I
could
beat
you
was
to
play
possum
,
but
it
was
a
good
try
,
kid
,
and
I
appreciate
it
.
The
wastebasket
stood
near
the
wall
next
to
the
divan
,
and
the
instant
Casey
picked
it
up
he
knew
what
had
happened
.
The
discarded
papers
inside
were
sodden
,
there
was
a
glint
of
liquid
at
the
bottom
,
and
the
smell
of
whisky
was
strong
and
distinct
.
He
put
the
basket
down
distastefully
,
muttering
softly
and
thoroughly
disgusted
with
himself
and
his
plan
that
had
seemed
so
foolproof
.
For
he
remembered
too
well
how
he
had
brought
back
the
loaded
drinks
to
Burton
and
then
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
get
weaker
drinks
for
himself
.
For
another
second
or
two
he
gave
in
to
the
annoyance
that
was
directed
at
himself
;
;
then
his
mind
moved
on
to
be
confronted
by
something
far
more
serious
,
and
as
the
thought
expanded
,
the
implications
jarred
him
.
It
no
longer
mattered
that
Burton
had
outsmarted
him
.
The
important
thing
was
that
Burton
had
gone
somewhere
to
meet
a
blackmailer
with
a
gun
in
his
pocket
.
And
that
gun
was
empty
.
Even
before
his
mind
had
rounded
out
the
idea
,
he
thrust
one
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
six
slugs
he
had
taken
from
the
revolver
.
He
considered
them
with
brooding
eyes
,
brows
bunched
as
his
brain
grappled
with
the
problem
and
tried
to
find
some
solution
.
He
said
:
``
The
crazy
fool
''
,
half
aloud
.
He
put
the
shells
on
the
table
,
as
though
he
could
no
longer
bear
to
hold
them
.
He
thought
:
Where
the
hell
could
he
have
gone
?
?
How
can
I
find
him
?
?
There
was
no
answer
to
this
and
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
across
the
room
,
his
imagination
out
of
control
.
He
tried
to
tell
himself
that
maybe
Burton
had
sobered
up
enough
to
get
some
sense
.
Maybe
he
only
intended
to
scare
the
blackmailer
,
whoever
he
was
,
in
which
case
an
unloaded
gun
would
be
good
enough
.
He
thought
of
other
possibilities
,
none
of
them
satisfactory
,
and
finally
he
began
to
think
,
to
wonder
if
there
was
some
way
he
could
reach
Burton
.
Then
,
as
he
turned
toward
the
telephone
,
it
rang
shrilly
to
shatter
the
stillness
in
the
room
and
he
reached
for
it
eagerly
.
``
Yeah
''
,
he
said
.
``
Casey
''
?
?
``
Yeah
''
.
``
Tony
Calenda
''
.
Casey
heard
the
voice
distinctly
and
he
knew
who
it
was
,
but
it
took
him
a
while
to
make
the
mental
readjustment
and
control
the
disturbance
inside
his
head
.
When
he
heard
Calenda
say
:
``
What
about
that
picture
you
took
this
afternoon
''
?
?
It
still
took
him
another
few
seconds
to
remember
the
job
he
had
done
for
Frank
Ackerly
.
``
What
picture
''
?
?
He
demanded
.
``
You
took
a
picture
of
me
at
the
corner
of
Washington
and
Blake
about
three
thirty
this
afternoon
''
.
``
Who
says
so
''
?
?
``
One
of
my
boys
''
.
Casey
believed
that
much
.
Calenda
was
not
the
sort
who
walked
around
without
one
of
his
``
boys
''
close
at
hand
.
``
So
''
?
?
``
With
my
trial
coming
up
in
Federal
Court
next
week
I
wouldn't
want
that
picture
published
''
.
``
Who
says
it's
going
to
be
published
''
?
?
``
I
wouldn't
even
want
it
to
get
around
''
.
Under
normal
circumstances
Casey
was
a
little
fussy
when
people
told
him
what
to
do
with
pictures
he
had
taken
.
Even
so
,
he
generally
listened
and
was
usually
reasonable
to
those
who
voiced
their
objections
properly
.
Right
now
,
however
,
he
was
still
too
worried
about
Jerry
Burton
,
and
the
gun
that
had
no
bullets
,
and
the
story
Burton
had
told
him
,
to
care
too
much
about
Tony
Calenda
.
His
nerves
were
getting
a
little
ragged
and
his
impatience
put
an
edge
in
his
voice
.
``
Look
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
was
hired
to
take
a
picture
.
I
took
it
.
That's
all
I
know
about
it
and
that's
all
I
care
''
.
``
Maybe
you'd
better
tell
the
guy
who
hired
you
what
I
said
''
.
``
You
tell
him
''
.
``
All
right
''
,
Calenda
said
,
his
voice
still
quiet
.
``
But
I
meant
what
I
said
,
Casey
.
If
that
picture
gets
around
and
I
find
out
you
had
anything
to
do
with
it
,
I'm
going
to
send
a
couple
of
my
boys
around
to
see
you
''
.
``
You
do
that
''
,
Casey
said
.
``
Just
be
sure
to
send
your
two
best
boys
,
Tony
''
.
He
hung
up
with
a
bang
,
annoyed
at
himself
for
running
off
at
the
mouth
like
that
but
still
terribly
concerned
with
the
situation
he
had
helped
to
create
.
As
soon
as
he
could
think
logically
again
he
reached
for
the
telephone
directory
and
found
Jerry
Burton's
home
number
.
He
dialed
it
and
listened
to
it
ring
ten
times
before
he
hung
up
.
He
called
the
bar
and
grill
where
he
had
picked
Burton
up
that
afternoon
.
When
he
was
told
that
no
one
had
seen
Burton
since
then
,
he
thought
of
three
other
places
that
were
possibilities
.
Each
time
he
got
the
same
answer
and
in
the
end
he
gave
up
.
By
the
time
he
had
smoked
three
cigarettes
he
had
calmed
down
.
He
had
done
all
he
could
and
that
was
that
.
And
anyway
Burton
was
not
the
kind
of
guy
who
would
be
likely
to
get
in
trouble
even
when
he
was
drunk
.
He
,
Casey
,
had
been
scared
for
a
while
,
but
that
had
come
mostly
from
the
fact
that
he
felt
responsible
.
He
should
have
stayed
here
and
watched
Burton
.
He
didn't
.
So
he
made
a
mistake
.
So
what
?
?
He
kept
telling
himself
this
as
he
went
out
to
the
kitchen
to
make
a
drink
.
Only
then
did
he
decide
he
didn't
want
one
.
He
considered
opening
a
can
of
beer
but
vetoed
that
idea
too
.
Finally
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
sat
down
to
take
off
his
shoes
.
He
had
just
finished
unlacing
the
right
one
when
the
telephone
rang
again
.
When
he
snatched
it
up
the
voice
that
came
to
him
was
quick
and
urgent
.
``
Casey
?
?
You
don't
know
me
but
I
know
you
.
If
you
want
a
picture
get
to
the
corner
of
Adams
and
Clark
just
as
fast
as
you
can
.
If
you
hurry
you
might
beat
the
headquarters
boys
''
.
Casey
heard
the
click
of
the
distant
receiver
before
he
could
open
his
mouth
,
and
it
took
him
no
more
than
three
seconds
to
make
his
decision
.
For
over
the
years
he
had
received
many
such
calls
.
Some
of
them
came
from
people
who
identified
themselves
.
Some
telephoned
because
he
had
done
them
a
favor
in
the
past
.
Others
because
they
expected
some
sort
of
reward
for
the
information
.
A
few
passed
along
a
tip
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
liked
him
and
wanted
to
give
him
a
break
.
Only
an
occasional
tip
turned
out
to
be
a
phony
,
and
,
like
the
police
,
Casey
had
made
a
point
of
running
down
all
such
suggestions
and
he
did
not
hesitate
this
time
.
He
was
in
his
car
with
his
camera
and
equipment
bag
in
less
than
two
minutes
,
and
it
took
him
only
three
more
to
reach
the
corner
,
a
block
from
Columbus
Avenue
.
It
was
a
district
of
small
factories
and
loft
buildings
and
occasional
tenements
,
and
he
could
see
the
police
radio
car
as
he
rounded
the
corner
and
slammed
on
the
brakes
.
He
did
not
bother
with
his
radio
--
there
would
be
time
for
that
later
--
but
as
he
scrambled
out
on
the
pavement
he
saw
the
filling
station
and
the
public
telephone
booth
and
knew
instantly
how
he
had
been
summoned
.
The
police
car
had
pulled
up
behind
a
small
sedan
,
its
headlights
still
on
.
Slowly
he
pulled
out
the
hand
throttle
until
the
boat
was
moving
at
little
more
than
a
crawl
,
and
watched
Elaine
rapidly
spin
from
one
station
to
another
,
tune
in
the
null
,
then
draw
in
a
line
on
the
chart
.
``
We're
out
just
a
little
too
far
.
Make
a
90
degree
straight
for
shore
''
.
Poet
came
in
,
raising
his
eyebrows
appreciatively
as
he
saw
Elaine
.
``
Now
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
Pretty
quick
''
,
she
replied
.
``
Will
you
drop
the
anchor
''
?
?
Poet
nodded
,
swung
below
and
a
moment
later
emerged
from
the
forward
hatch
where
he
picked
up
the
anchor
.
The
rock
and
roll
music
coming
from
the
radio
station
suddenly
faded
as
the
boat
coasted
into
the
null
on
the
Aj
.
``
Reverse
''
,
Elaine
said
,
then
peered
through
the
loop
of
the
RDF
and
waved
to
Poet
.
A
second
later
she
came
behind
the
wheel
and
backed
off
the
anchor
line
until
it
was
set
in
the
ocean
floor
.
She
cut
the
engines
and
slowly
the
cruiser
swung
around
on
the
end
of
its
lines
until
its
bow
was
pointing
into
the
wind
and
the
cockpit
faced
toward
the
shore
.
Nick
watched
her
somewhat
enviously
as
she
efficiently
cut
the
engines
,
and
started
the
auxiliary
motor
.
Poet
came
up
from
below
,
wearing
new
bathing
trunks
.
The
price
tag
hung
from
the
belt
and
he
pulled
it
off
as
he
entered
the
chartroom
and
looked
at
it
curiously
.
Nick
wondered
if
Elaine
had
bought
them
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
Nobody
,
he
suddenly
realized
,
was
saying
anything
.
It
seemed
as
if
they
were
all
under
a
spell
.
There
should
be
an
excited
conversation
,
for
somewhere
,
directly
below
them
,
was
a
treasure
lost
for
more
than
four
hundred
years
.
But
instead
of
chatter
there
was
a
null
,
like
on
the
radio
direction
finder
.
Once
,
in
New
York
,
he
had
gone
flying
with
some
friends
in
a
small
private
airplane
with
a
single
engine
.
They
had
all
been
laughing
,
joking
,
when
suddenly
the
engine
had
failed
.
No
one
had
screamed
.
No
one
had
prayed
.
All
had
fallen
into
a
complete
silence
,
listening
to
the
wind
whistle
over
the
wings
.
The
pilot
had
been
good
.
He'd
landed
the
plane
on
a
small
airstrip
in
Connecticut
and
as
soon
as
the
aircraft
had
coasted
to
a
stop
,
everyone
had
burst
into
chatter
at
the
same
moment
.
There
had
been
tension
in
the
plane
during
the
silent
descent
;
;
a
tension
similar
to
the
one
now
.
But
in
the
plane
there
was
a
concrete
reason
for
it
.
Now
,
at
this
moment
,
there
should
be
none
unless
skin
diving
was
much
more
dangerous
than
he
had
been
led
to
believe
.
Yet
tension
existed
.
The
same
taut-nerved
relationship
as
there
had
been
between
the
passengers
on
the
plane
now
strained
at
the
three
of
them
here
on
the
boat
.
It
hung
over
them
like
a
cloud
,
its
arrival
as
sudden
as
a
cloud
skidding
over
the
sun
.
Silently
,
Elaine
picked
up
her
keys
from
the
table
and
went
out
into
the
cockpit
,
Poet
behind
her
,
Nick
trailing
behind
him
.
She
threw
back
a
cushion
over
one
of
the
seats
,
unlocked
a
padlock
on
the
chest
beneath
it
,
then
presently
straightened
,
holding
a
long
knife
and
a
wicked
looking
spear
gun
in
her
hand
.
Poet
whistled
softly
as
he
looked
at
the
gun
.
``
Hydraulic
''
?
?
He
asked
.
Elaine
nodded
.
``
They
are
the
best
''
.
She
kicked
the
locker
lid
shut
and
replaced
the
cushion
.
``
They
are
the
most
efficient
''
.
``
And
the
deadliest
''
,
Poet
commented
as
he
buckled
on
his
tank
harness
.
``
Why
do
you
need
an
arsenal
''
?
?
Nick
asked
,
apprehensively
,
staring
at
the
weapon
.
``
It's
quite
possible
there's
more
than
codfish
down
there
,
man
''
,
Poet
replied
with
a
short
,
nervous
laugh
as
he
held
the
harness
for
Elaine
.
A
moment
later
,
moving
awkwardly
because
of
the
swimming
fins
,
she
picked
up
the
gun
,
handed
the
knife
to
Poet
,
then
rolled
off
the
transom
of
the
boat
,
back
first
.
Poet
nodded
to
Nick
and
entered
the
water
in
a
similar
fashion
.
Another
moment
and
they
were
out
of
sight
,
leaving
behind
only
a
string
of
bubbles
as
a
clue
to
their
whereabouts
.
For
a
while
Nick
followed
the
twisting
course
of
the
bubbles
,
wondering
which
set
came
from
Elaine
.
They
remained
close
together
,
their
air
trail
wiggling
like
serpents
traveling
side
by
side
.
Eventually
the
bubbles
became
lost
in
the
sparkle
of
the
ocean
surface
,
and
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
.
Clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
he
stared
at
the
blue
sky
.
There
was
nothing
quite
like
being
alone
on
a
boat
on
the
ocean
.
Alfredo
certainly
must
have
enjoyed
being
alone
.
Next
to
the
ocean
,
probably
the
loneliest
spot
was
the
desert
.
If
Elaine's
uncle
had
stuck
to
this
desire
for
aloneness
,
he
probably
would
still
be
alive
.
Yet
Alfredo
wanted
money
wanted
money
to
roam
through
the
deserts
.
And
Graham
wanted
money
probably
to
roam
among
the
dice
tables
in
Las
Vegas
.
It
was
an
odd
combination
a
strange
pair
to
stumble
upon
the
wreck
of
the
Trinidad
.
But
Graham
hadn't
stumbled
on
it
.
Two
to
three
weeks
prior
to
the
charter
of
the
Virginia
,
Graham
had
been
snooping
around
the
San
Luis
Rey
Mission
.
The
small
helicopter
with
its
two
steel
skids
churned
offshore
and
Nick
raised
up
to
watch
it
heading
south
.
That
was
a
hell
of
a
note
,
he
thought
.
A
couple
couldn't
even
find
a
secluded
spot
anywhere
on
a
beach
to
neck
nowadays
without
someone
swooping
down
upon
them
.
If
the
character
flying
that
thing
had
gone
over
San
Clemente
Island
yesterday
he
would
have
had
an
eyeful
.
Off
to
the
west
a
beautiful
schooner
slowly
beat
its
way
into
the
wind
,
headed
on
a
tack
toward
San
Clemente
.
Behind
it
a
cabin
cruiser
drifted
crossways
in
the
small
ground-swell
,
a
lone
fisherman
in
the
chair
aft
.
The
fisherman
was
right
in
the
middle
of
the
Deep
.
Nick
recalled
stories
that
the
two
best
fishing
spots
in
Southern
California
were
over
the
La
Jolla
Deep
and
the
Redondo
Deep
,
two
spots
where
the
ocean
dropped
off
to
fantastic
depths
almost
from
the
shoreline
.
Someday
,
geologists
had
warned
,
the
land
on
both
sides
of
these
deeps
would
fall
into
the
ocean
and
no
more
La
Jolla
or
Redondo
Beach
.
Meanwhile
,
fishermen
took
advantage
of
them
to
pull
up
whoppers
.
Sometimes
the
fish
exploded
as
they
neared
the
surface
because
of
the
difference
in
pressure
.
Why
,
he
wondered
,
had
Elaine
wanted
him
along
on
this
trip
?
?
He
couldn't
skindive
,
he
couldn't
run
a
boat
,
except
on
the
open
sea
.
He
stood
up
,
stretched
,
looked
around
for
the
bubbles
,
but
could
see
none
.
Strolling
down
to
the
galley
,
he
lit
the
butane
under
the
coffee
pot
and
when
the
brew
was
heated
,
poured
himself
a
cup
and
went
up
to
the
chartroom
.
Turning
on
the
hi-fi
,
he
went
back
to
the
cockpit
,
stretched
out
on
the
cushions
and
listened
to
the
music
.
Elaine
and
Poet
returned
together
,
popping
up
over
the
transom
almost
like
dolphins
breaking
water
.
He
sat
up
and
watched
as
they
pulled
themselves
over
the
stern
.
``
Any
luck
''
?
?
He
asked
.
Poet
shook
his
head
,
sliding
his
face
mask
up
on
his
forehead
.
``
We're
right
on
the
edge
of
the
Deep
''
,
Elaine
said
.
Pulling
off
her
face
mask
,
she
carefully
placed
the
spear
gun
across
the
stern
,
then
lifted
her
wet
hair
from
her
back
and
squeezed
out
the
water
.
``
Which
is
a
break
as
the
area
to
search
is
less
than
a
square
mile
''
,
she
added
as
she
swung
her
legs
over
the
transom
.
``
Any
news
''
?
?
``
Not
a
thing
''
.
He
tossed
her
a
towel
,
then
repeated
the
service
for
Poet
.
``
Cigarette
''
?
?
Elaine
shook
her
head
as
she
slipped
out
of
her
harness
,
but
Poet
nodded
.
His
feet
still
hung
over
the
stern
of
the
transom
,
but
as
he
reached
for
the
smoke
he
raised
them
to
swing
them
in
.
The
fin
on
his
foot
caught
on
the
moulding
,
throwing
him
off
balance
.
His
forearm
smashed
painfully
into
the
narrow
washboard
and
he
grimaced
as
he
grabbed
his
bruised
limb
with
his
other
hand
and
rolled
into
the
boat
.
``
Kee-reist
''
!
!
The
word
hissed
distinctly
from
Poet's
lips
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
.
Nick's
body
became
rigid
.
Turning
slowly
he
saw
Poet
in
a
brilliant
glare
of
horror
.
Poet
!
!
His
face
was
still
creased
in
pain
as
he
studied
the
underside
of
his
arm
.
Poet
a
murderer
?
?
Turning
quickly
toward
Elaine
,
Nick
saw
that
she
,
too
,
stood
in
shocked
surprise
.
The
sudden
silence
was
too
silent
.
Instinctively
aware
of
the
charged
atmosphere
,
Poet
raised
his
head
slowly
,
looking
first
at
Elaine
.
She
had
caught
the
implication
of
the
oath
.
Her
face
was
frozen
into
the
mask
of
a
mannequin
,
her
body
absolutely
motionless
.
And
then
Nick
knew
that
all
of
them
knew
Elaine
,
himself
and
Poet
.
Elaine
recovered
first
,
so
quickly
that
Nick
thought
he
might
have
imagined
her
sudden
reaction
.
``
Do
you
need
a
bandage
''
?
?
She
asked
steadily
.
Poet
rubbed
his
arm
.
``
It's
like
banging
a
shin
''
,
he
said
,
his
eyes
lingered
on
Nick's
face
,
then
moved
back
to
Elaine
.
``
Hurts
like
hell
for
a
second
,
then
it
disappears
''
.
``
I'll
get
some
ointment
''
.
Elaine
turned
and
started
toward
the
companionway
.
But
her
walk
was
too
steady
,
too
slow
,
telegraphing
her
fear
.
Nick
sensed
it
.
So
did
Poet
.
Springing
like
a
cat
,
he
leaped
back
,
swooped
up
the
spring
gun
and
,
whirling
,
pointed
it
toward
the
cabin
.
At
the
same
instant
,
Nick
hit
the
barrel
and
threw
himself
upon
the
smaller
man
.
The
gun
fired
next
to
his
ear
with
a
vicious
whoosh
like
the
first
stroke
of
an
old
steam
engine
.
At
the
same
instant
,
Elaine
screamed
wildly
,
the
sound
ending
abruptly
as
Nick
went
off
the
boat
and
into
the
water
on
top
of
the
frantic
,
struggling
Poet
.
The
moment
the
sea
closed
over
Nick
,
some
atavistic
sense
warned
him
that
he
would
survive
in
this
alien
element
only
if
he
did
not
panic
.
But
the
murderer
to
whom
he
clung
had
a
tremendous
advantage
.
The
wide
flippers
on
Poet's
feet
gave
his
legs
incredible
power
,
driving
the
two
of
them
down
into
the
water
as
they
rolled
over
and
over
.
Poet
was
the
captured
,
arms
pinioned
to
his
side
,
and
he
twisted
convulsively
trying
to
escape
.
Poet
would
escape
,
Nick
thought
grimly
,
because
he
wore
the
apparatus
which
would
keep
him
alive
under
water
.
But
Nick
would
not
let
go
.
The
rubber
and
glass
face
mask
slipped
from
Poet's
forehead
,
bounced
painlessly
off
Nick's
chin
,
then
disappeared
.
Poet
twisted
again
and
Nick's
knuckles
scraped
on
the
air
tank
,
ripping
off
the
skin
.
For
a
split
second
,
Nick
relaxed
his
grip
and
Poet's
slippery
body
spun
completely
around
before
Nick
could
stop
him
,
holding
him
now
from
the
rear
.
Something
flailed
at
the
side
of
Nick's
head
as
they
rolled
around
and
around
.
Suddenly
Poet
stopped
struggling
and
the
two
of
them
hung
suspended
in
the
water
,
not
rising
,
not
sinking
.
A
sharp
pain
lanced
across
Nick's
chest
and
a
bubble
of
air
escaped
from
his
tortured
lungs
,
joining
dozens
of
others
that
sailed
lazily
toward
the
surface
like
helium
balloons
rising
into
the
sky
.
A
black
,
snake-like
object
swayed
eerily
in
front
of
him
,
spewing
bubbles
from
its
flat
cobra
head
.
The
air
hose
was
free
!
!
The
discovery
struck
Nick
like
a
blow
.
Desperately
,
Nick
flashed
one
hand
up
,
catching
Poet's
neck
in
the
bend
of
his
elbow
.
At
the
same
instant
,
he
grabbed
the
loose
,
writhing
hose
with
his
other
hand
and
bit
down
on
the
hard
rubber
mouthpiece
.
Instinctively
he
exhaled
through
his
nose
then
sucked
in
the
air
from
the
hose
.
At
once
the
excruciating
pain
in
his
chest
stopped
and
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
,
wild
exultation
.
As
if
this
was
a
signal
,
Poet
abruptly
began
to
thrash
the
water
and
the
quick
movement
slowly
made
them
sink
through
the
water
.
Relentlessly
,
Nick
held
on
,
sucking
on
the
hose
,
inhaling
the
air
that
belonged
to
Poet
.
Poet
was
not
fighting
Nick
now
.
Harbor
Point
sticks
out
into
the
ocean
like
the
fat
neck
of
a
steamer
clam
.
It's
a
rich
village
but
not
much
for
action
--
too
many
solid
residents
,
not
enough
tourists
or
working
stiffs
.
It's
at
the
far
end
of
the
county
and
the
last
time
I
came
here
was
for
a
hit
and
run
manslaughter
--
about
seven
months
ago
.
Chief
Bob
Moore
looked
his
same
hick-self
;
;
a
man
mountain
running
to
lard
in
his
middle-age
.
Seeing
me
he
said
with
real
surprise
,
``
Well
,
well
,
ain't
we
honored
!
!
Hardly
expected
the
head
of
County
Homicide
up
for
this
murder
.
You
sure
climbed
fast

Jed

Rookie
investigator
last
summer
and
now
it's

Took
me
19
years
to
become
Chief
of
our
three
man
police
force
.
Proves
a
college
education
pays
off
''
.
His
sarcasm
was
followed
by
a
stupid
grin
of
his
thick
mouth
and
bad
teeth
.
``
I
guess
it
helps
''
,
I
said
,
paying
no
attention
to
his
ribbing
.
``
Never
could
figure
out
why
you
ever
wanted
to
be
a
cop
,
Jed
.
You're
not
only
young
but
well
,
you
don't
even
look
like
a
police
officer
.
A
runt
with
narrow
shoulders
and
that
brush
haircut
hell
,
you'd
pass
for
a
juvenile
delinquent
of
the
hotrod
set
.
In
my
day
the
first
requirement
for
a
cop
was
to
look
like
the
law
,
big
and
tough
.
Man
,
when
my
275
pounds
and
six-four
comes
along
,
why
it's
the
same
as
another
badge
.
When
I
say
move
,
a
guy
moves
''
!
!
``
Don't
worry
about
my
being
tough

Moore

Also
,
it's
far
too
early
in
the
day
for
corny
lines
like
the
bigger
they

your
gassy

get
to
work

Who
was
the
murdered
woman
Mrs.
Buck

?
?
``
Widow

nice
sort
of

a
fair-sized

Came
to
the
Harbor

a
bride

Don't

.
``
Yeah
,
passed
your
road
block
as
I
drove
in
''
,
I
said
,
sitting
on
his
polished
desk
.
Although
Bob
dressed
like
a
slob
,
he
kept
a
neat
office
.
``
Okay
,
what
happened
''
?
?
``
About
nine
this
morning
Mrs.
Buck
phones
me
she's

trouble
with
one
of
her
farm
hands

money
trouble

Colored
fellow
named
Tim
Williams

working
for
her
now

Tim
come
with
the
migratory
workers
that
follow
the
crops
up
from
the
South
last
year
,
but
Tim
and
his
wife
settled
here
.
Never
had
no
trouble
with
him
before
,
thought
he
was
a
hard
worker
,
hustling
around
to
get
a
full
week's
work
.
Anyway
,
Julia
asks
me
to

``
Julia
''
?
?
``
Come
on
,
Inspector
,
look
alive
.
Julia
Buck
,
the
deceased
''
,
Moore
said
,
slipping
me
his
smug
,
idiot-grin
again
.
``
Julia
asks
me
to
come
out
at
once
.
But
she
didn't
sound
real
alarmed
you
know
,
like
there
was
any
immediate
danger
.
I
got
there
at
9:47
A.M.
,
found
her
strangled
.
I
would
have
come
sooner
if
I'd
known
.
No
doubt
about
Tim
being
the
killer
--
I
have
a
witness
.
Don't
know
why
the
County
had
to
send
anybody
up
here

Told

I
can
handle
this

.
``
Yeah
,
seems
you
have
a
nice
package

with
all
the
strings
tied

Who's

?
?
``
I'll
collar
Tim
before
night
''
.
``
Who's
your
witness
''
?
?
``
Julia
had
--
has
--
an
old
Indian
woman
cooking
for
her
--
Nellie
Harris
.
Probably
the
last
of
the
original
Island
Indians
.
Nellie
was
in
the
kitchen
,
had
just
come
to
work
,
when
she
heard
Tim
arguing
with
Julia
in
the
living
room
.
Swears
she
recognized
his
voice
,
that
Tim
yelled
,
'
It's
my
money
and
I
want
it
'
!
!
And
then
rushed
out
of
the
house
.
Then
she
heard
Julia
phone
me
.
Nellie
went
on
with
her
house
work
--
until
I
found
Julia
dead
.
And
before
you
say
it
,
Nellie
ain't
near
strong
enough
to
have
strangled
Julia
.
There's
no
doubt
this
Tim
sneaked
back
and
killed
Mrs.
Buck
.
Another
fact
:
Tim's
disappeared
--
on
the
run
.
But
there's
no
way
off
the
Point
except
through
my
road
block
.
Guess
you
want
to
see
the
body
--
have
her
up
the
street
in
Doc
Abel's
office
''
.
``
Let's
see
it
''
.
We
walked
up
Main
Street
to
this
big
white
house
,
then
around
to
the
back
.
Being
the
Harbor's
sole
doctor
,
Abel
was
also
its
Medical
Examiner
.
The
corpse
was
on
a
table
,
covered
by
a
sheet
.
Doc
Abel
was
busy
up
front
with
some
of
his
live
patients
.
Pulling
back
the
sheet
,
I
examined
the
bruises
around
Julia
Buck's
once
slender
throat
.
Powerful
hands
had
killed
her
.
``
Find
any
prints
''
?
?
Chief
Moore
shook
his
big
head
,
seemed
lost
in
thought
as
he
stared
at
the
nude
body
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Never
noticed
it
before
I
mean
,
when
she
was
dressed
but
for
a
woman
her
age
,
Julia
had
a
real
fine
figure
''
.
I
dropped
the
sheet
,
glanced
at
my
watch
.
It
was
almost
one
and
I
hadn't
had
lunch
.
Still
,
I
wanted
to
get
this
over
with
,
had
a
lot
of
paper
work
waiting
in
my
own
office
.
I
told
him
,
``
I
want
to
go
see
the
Buck
house
''
.
``
Sure
''
.
Walking
back
down
Main
Street
,
I
said
,
``
I
saw
the
Harbor's
one
squad
car
at
the
road
block
,
we'll
ride
out
in
my
car
''
.
``
Naw
,
we'll
use
mine
''
,
Moore
said
,
opening
the
door
of
a
sleek
white
Jaguar
roadster
.
As
I
slid
in
beside
him
he
said
,
``
Some
heap
,
hey
?
?
Got
a
heck
of
a
buy
on
this
,
dirt
cheap
''
.
``
Yeah
,
it's
a
real
load
''
,
I
told
him
,
looking
up
the
street
at
my
battered
Ford
.
Five
racing
minutes
later
we
pulled
into
the
driveway
of
this
typical
two-story
house
,
and
when
the
Jaguar
stopped
I
managed
to
swallow
.
There
was
a
garage
and
a
modern
barn
in
the
rear
,
all
of
it
standing
between
two
large
flat
fields
planted
in
early
potatoes
.
Everything
shouted
gentleman
farming
,
the
kind
of
grandfather-father-to-son
folding
money
the
Point
is
known
for
.
The
fins
of
a
Caddy
were
sticking
out
of
the
garage
,
while
the
inside
of
the
house
was
a
comfortable
mixture
of
old
and
expensive
contemporary
furniture
.
Nellie
Harris
wasn't
old
,
she
was
ancient
--
a
tiny
shriveled
woman
with
a
face
like
a
tan
prune
.
She
was
also
stone
deaf
in
her
right
ear
.
She
calmly
repeated
what
Moore
had
told
me
.
When
I
asked
,
``
Why
didn't
you
go
into
the
living
room
to
see
how
Mrs.
Buck
was
''
?
?
The
old
gal
stared
at
me
with
her
hard
eyes
,
said
,
``
She
didn't
call
.
I
do
the
living
room
last
.
I
went
up
stairs
and
did
the
bath
and
her
bedroom
--
way
I
always
do
in
the
morning
''
.
``
Have
you
any
idea
what
this
Tim
and
Mrs.
Buck
were
arguing
about
''
?
?
``
Probably
wages
.
Miss
Julia
was
a
hard
woman
with
a
dollar
.
Years
ago
when
I
asked
her
to
put
me
in
Social
Security
,
so's
I
wouldn't
have
to
be
working
now
,
Miss
Julia
threatened
to
fire
me
--
all
because
it
would
mean
a
few
more
dollars
a
year
to
her
''
.
``
Did
you
hear
Tim
return
''
?
?
``
No
sir
.
Nobody
came
until
Chief
Moore
''
.
I
drummed
on
the
kitchen
table
with
my
pencil
.
``
Mrs.
Buck
have
any
men
friends
''
?
?
``
Her
''
?
?
The
wrinkled
mouth
laughed
,
revealing
astonishingly
strong
,
white
,
teeth
.
``
I
never
see
none
.
But
then
I
wasn't
her
social
secretary
''
.
``
Was
she
on
friendly
terms
with
other
members
of
her
family
''
?
?
``
Didn't
have
no
family
--
around
here
.
They
had
a
son
--
killed
in
the
war
''
.
I
walked
into
the
living
room
.
There
didn't
seem
to
be
any
signs
of
a
struggle
.
I
told
Moore
,
``
Where
does
Tim's
wife
live
''
?
?
``
I'll
take
you
there
.
Look
Jed
,
this
is
an
open
and
shut
case
and
I
have
to
relieve
my
men
at
the
road
block
soon
.
Okay
,
come
on
''
.
We
did
80
miles
an
hour
across
a
hard
dirt
road
to
a
cluster
of
shacks
.
In
late
summer
migratory
workers
lived
five
and
six
to
a
room
in
these
.
Now
they
were
empty
,
except
for
a
cottage
across
the
road
.
Mrs.
Tim
Williams
was
about
21
,
with
skin
the
color
of
bitter
chocolate
,
and
if
you
discounted
the
plain
dress
and
worn
slippers
,
she
was
startlingly
pretty
.
The
inside
of
their
place
was
full
of
new
furniture
,
five
bucks
down
and
a
buck
a
week
stuff
,
but
all
of
it
clean
and
full
of
the
warmth
of
a
home
.
Mrs.
Williams
was
both
sullen
and
frightened
.
She
said
she
didn't
know
a
thing
--
Tim
had
left
the
house
at
six
in
the
morning
,
as
usual
.
She
hadn't
seen
him
since
.
``
Did
Mrs.
Buck
owe
him
any
wages
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
Well
,
for
this
week
,
but
they
wasn't
due
'till
Saturday
.
Listen
,
Mr.
Inspector
,
no
matter
what
anybody
say
,
my
Tim
didn't
kill
that
woman
!
!
Tim
is
a
good
man
,
hard
working
.
He
strong
as
a
bull
but
gentle
as
a
baby
.
Even
if
he
angry
,
Tim
wouldn't
hurt
a
woman
.
He
never
in
his
life
took
a
hand
to
a
woman
or
''
``
We'll
get
him
soon
,
see
what
he
says
''
,
Chief
Moore
cut
in
.
``
Does
your
husband
have
a
car
''
?
?
I
asked
.
``
Got
us
an
old
station
wagon
.
Need
it
for
the
job
''
.
I
asked
a
silly
question
:
``
You've
no
idea
where
your
husband
could
be
,
now
''
?
?
She
shook
her
head
.
I
knew
she
was
lying
.
I
stood
there
,
staring
at
her
for
a
moment
--
thinking
mostly
of
her
beauty
and
her
poverty
.
Moore
said
,
``
Come
on
,
Jed
,
I
have
to
get
to
my
men
''
.
On
my
way
out
I
told
her
,
``
If
you
should
eh
just
happen
to
see
your
husband
,
get
him
to
give
himself
up
.
He'll
get
a
fair
trial
.
Hiding
out
like
this
won't
get
him
anything
,
except
more
trouble
,
or
a
bullet
''
.
``
Yes
.
I'll
tell
him
--
if
I
see
him
''
.
We
made
it
back
to
the
Harbor
in
less
than
four
minutes
.
I
tried
not
to
act
scared
.
That
Jaguar
could
really
barrel
along
.
I
told
Moore
I
was
going
to
eat
,
get
some
forms
filled
out
by
Doc
Abel
.
Chief
Moore
said
,
``
If
I
don't
see
you
when
I
return
,
see
you
for
certain
at
my
road
block
,
Inspector
''
.
I
had
a
bowl
of
decent
chowder
,
phoned
the
Doc
and
he
said
he'd
leave
the
death
statements
with
his
girl
--
in
a
half
hour
.
Lighting
my
pipe
,
I
took
a
walk
.
The
Harbor
is
a
big
yachting
basin
in
the
summer
.
Even
now
,
there
were
several
slick
cruisers
tied
to
the
dock
,
an
ocean-going
yawl
anchored
inside
the
breakwater
.
There
was
a
34
foot
Wheeler
with
Chief
Bob's
in
big
gold
letters
on
its
stern
also
tied
up
at
the
dock
.
It
wasn't
a
new
boat
,
about
five
years
old
,
but
fitted
with
fishing
outriggers
and
chairs
.
I
asked
an
old
guy
running
a
fishing
station
if
the
boat
was
Moore's
.
He
said
,
``
You
bet
.
Bob
Moore
is
plumb
crazy
about
blue
fishing
''
.
I
dropped
into
the
doctor's
office
,
picked
up
my
forms
.
As
I
was
walking
back
to
the
Police
Station
,
which
was
in
the
same
building
with
the
City
Hall
and
Post
Office
,
I
saw
Mrs.
Tim
Williams
sneaking
into
the
back
of
my
car
.
If
she
moved
gracefully
,
she
was
clumsy
at
it
.
I
got
into
the
front
seat
.
She
was
'
hiding
'
on
the
floor
of
the
back
seat
,
the
soft
curves
of
her
back
and
hips
--
rousing
lines
.
I
drove
out
of
the
Harbor
,
turned
off
into
a
dirt
road
among
the
scrub
pine
trees
and
stopped
.
I
waited
a
few
minutes
and
she
sat
up
.
For
another
moment
we
didn't
talk
,
then
she
began
to
weep
.
She
mumbled
,
``
I
just
know
that
Chief
Moore
is
out
to
kill
my
Tim
''
!
!
``
Maybe
.
I
never
saw
him
so
anxious
before
''
,
I
said
,
lighting
my
pipe
and
offering
her
a
cigarette
.
``
Of
course
,
it
could
be
because
this
is
his
first
murder
case
.
You
know
where
Tim
is
,
don't
you
,
Mrs.
Williams
''
?
?
She
puffed
on
the
cigarette
slowly
,
sitting
slumped
against
the
back
seat
;
;
didn't
answer
.
But
the
police
have
dropped
the
case
.
I
want
you
to
go
to
Pearson
City
and
find
out
why
--
first-hand
stuff
for
your
modern
crime
series
.
Take
the
same
train
Diana
Beauclerk
took
and
get
there
at
the
same
time
.
Go
to
the
same
hotel
and
occupy
the
same
suite
--
1105
''
.
``
Will
the
hotel
rent
it
so
soon
after
the
crime
''
?
?
``
Why
not
?
?
The
police
have
finished
with
it
.
Besides
,
the
number
of
the
suite
hasn't
been
published
in
any
newspaper
.
To
the
hotel
people
,
you'll
just
be
an
innocent
tourist
who
happens
to
ask
for
that
particular
suite
''
.
``
Still
,
they
may
not
want
to
rent
it
''
.
``
That's
your
headache
.
Once
inside
,
keep
your
eyes
open
''
!
!
``
For
what
''
!
!
Alec
was
growing
more
and
more
skeptical
.
``
The
police
will
have
gone
over
every
square
inch
of
the
place
with
a
fine-tooth
comb
.
The
hotel
people
will
have
scoured
and
vacuumed
it
.
Ten
to
one
,
it's
even
been
redecorated
''
!
!
``
There's
always
a
chance
they
may
have
overlooked
something
''
,
returned
the
chief
.
``
I'm
betting
on
that
chance
.
Interview
the
bellboy
and
chambermaid
who
waited
on
Beauclerk
.
Study
the
topography
of
the
suite
.
Soak
up
local
color
.
Reenact
everything
Beauclerk
did
.
Try
to
imagine
you're
going
to
be
murdered
yourself
--
between
eleven
p.m.
and
one
a.m.
the
night
you
arrive
''
.
Alec
smirked
.
``
Cheerful
way
to
spend
an
evening
''
!
!
A
sudden
thought
wiped
the
smirk
from
his
face
.
``
Suppose
the
murderer
should
return
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
''
!
!
The
chief's
eyes
gleamed
.
He
spoke
softly
.
``
That
is
exactly
what
I'm
hoping
for
.
After
all
,
the
murderer
is
still
at
large
.
And
the
key
to
the
suite
is
still
missing
''
.
On
the
train
Alec
refreshed
his
memory
of
the
Beauclerk
case
by
reading
teletype
flimsies
--
spot-news
stories
about
the
crime
sent
out
by
the
Pearson
City
Star
,
a
member
of
the
Syndicate
Press
.
Diana
Beauclerk
was
a
second-rate
actress
living
in
New
York
.
Two
weeks
ago
she
had
gone
west
to
Pearson
City
.
Daniel
Forbes
,
her
divorced
husband
,
lived
there
.
So
did
the
firm
of
lawyers
who
had
got
her
the
divorce
,
Kimball
and
Stacy
.
She
reached
Pearson
City
at
nine
p.m.
and
went
straight
to
the
Hotel
Westmore
.
She
telephoned
the
junior
partner
of
her
law
firm
,
Martin
Stacy
,
and
asked
him
to
call
at
her
hotel
that
evening
.
At
the
time
of
her
divorce
Forbes
had
promised
to
pay
her
a
lump
sum
in
lieu
of
further
alimony
if
she
remarried
.
According
to
Stacy
,
she
told
him
she
was
planning
to
remarry
and
she
wanted
him
to
ask
Forbes
for
the
lump
sum
.
Stacy
replied
that
it
would
bankrupt
Forbes
,
who
had
just
sunk
all
his
money
in
a
real
estate
venture
.
Stacy
said
he
left
her
suite
at
nine
forty-five
p.m.
.
She
was
in
good
health
and
spirits
,
but
still
determined
to
get
the
money
from
Forbes
.
No
one
saw
Stacy
leave
.
No
other
visitor
inquired
for
her
that
evening
.
Next
morning
she
was
found
dead
in
her
suite
with
a
bullet
from
a
Colt
revolver
in
her
brain
.
According
to
the
medical
examiner
,
she
was
shot
between
eleven
p.m.
and
one
a.m.
.
Her
door
was
locked
and
the
key
was
missing
.
So
was
the
gun
.
When
Alec
finished
reading
he
was
sure
that
either
Forbes
or
Stacy
had
killed
Diana
Beauclerk
.
Forbes
had
motive
and
Stacy
had
opportunity
.
Find
a
motive
for
Stacy
or
an
opportunity
for
Forbes
and
the
case
would
be
solved
.
The
Hotel
Westmore
proved
to
be
one
of
the
older
hotels
in
Pearson
City
,
and
definitely
second-rate
.
Alec's
first
impression
of
the
lobby
was
gloomy
,
Victorian
dignity
--
black
walnut
and
red
plush
,
a
black
and
white
tiled
floor
,
and
Persian
rugs
.
He
studied
the
night
clerk
as
a
man
measures
an
adversary
.
``
I'd
like
the
room
I
had
the
last
time
''
.
``
Certainly
,
sir
''
.
The
clerk
was
young
and
limp
,
with
a
tired
smile
.
``
Do
you
recall
the
number
''
?
?
``
It
was
1105
''
.
The
clerk's
smile
congealed
.
``
That
suite
is
taken
''
.
Alec's
glance
went
to
a
chart
of
guest
names
and
room
numbers
hanging
on
the
wall
behind
the
clerk
.
Opposite
the
number
1105
stood
one
word
:
Unoccupied
.
The
clerk's
glance
followed
Alec's
.
``
We
have
better
rooms
vacant
now
''
,
he
babbled
.
``
Larger
and
more
comfortable
.
At
the
same
rate
''
.
Alec's
face
was
dark
,
blunt
,
and
sulky
.
He
always
looked
impertinent
and
he
could
look
dangerous
.
He
was
looking
dangerous
now
.
He
raised
his
voice
.
``
Anything
wrong
with
the
plumbing
in
1105
''
?
?
There
was
a
sudden
stillness
in
the
lobby
.
Two
women
,
who
had
been
chattering
like
parrots
,
were
struck
dumb
.
A
man
,
lighting
a
match
for
his
cigar
,
paused
until
the
flame
burned
his
fingers
.
Even
the
bellboys
on
their
bench
were
listening
.
The
clerk's
eyes
flickered
.
``
Of
course
not
''
!
!
``
Anybody
with
a
contagious
disease
been
in
there
''
?
?
``
No
''
!
!
The
clerk
was
almost
hysterical
.
``
It's
just
that
--
well
,
1105
is
being
redecorated
''
.
``
I
don't
believe
it
''
.
Alec
leaned
on
the
desk
,
holding
the
clerk's
eyes
with
his
.
``
Suppose
you
tell
me
the
real
reason
''
,
he
drawled
.
``
There
might
be
a
story
in
it
''
.
``
St-story
''
?
?
``
I'm
with
the
Syndicated
Press
,
Feature
Service
.
Either
I
get
the
story
--
or
I
get
the
suite
''
.
It
was
blackmail
and
the
clerk
knew
it
.
``
There
is
no
story
''
,
he
piped
tremulously
.
``
Front
!
!
Show
this
gentleman
to
1105
''
!
!
The
stillness
persisted
as
Alec
followed
a
bellboy
across
the
lobby
to
the
elevator
.
He
could
feel
eyes
on
his
back
.
He
wished
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
announce
the
number
of
his
suite
quite
so
publicly
.
The
corridor
on
the
eleventh
floor
was
dimly
lighted
by
electric
globes
at
intervals
of
thirty
feet
.
A
thick
,
crimson
carpet
muffled
every
footfall
.
At
the
end
of
the
corridor
Alec
noticed
a
door
marked
:
Fire
Stairs
.
It
was
a
neat
setup
for
murder
.
The
bellboy
unlocked
a
white
door
numbered
1105
.
The
room
was
dark
but
a
neon
sign
flashed
and
faded
beyond
the
window
.
A
few
snowflakes
sifted
down
through
that
theatrical
red
glow
,
languid
as
falling
feathers
.
Hastily
the
boy
switched
on
a
ceiling
light
.
The
room
looked
normal
and
even
commonplace
.
There
was
no
hint
of
a
violent
struggle
now
.
Deal
furniture
with
a
mahogany
finish
was
neatly
arranged
as
if
it
stood
in
the
window
of
a
department
store
.
The
blue
rug
was
suspiciously
bright
and
new
.
It
had
never
been
stained
with
blood
.
Table
covers
and
towels
were
clean
,
ashtrays
empty
and
supplied
with
fresh
matches
.
The
mirror
over
the
bureau
was
a
blank
eye
,
round
and
innocent
.
Alec
played
the
part
of
an
innocent
tourist
.
``
Is
there
anything
wrong
with
this
room
''
?
?
``
N-no
''
.
The
boy
dropped
his
eyes
.
``
Afraid
you'll
lose
your
job
if
you
don't
keep
your
mouth
shut
''
?
?
The
boy
raised
his
eyes
.
``
Listen
,
mister
.
If
you
want
my
advice
,
pack
up
and
take
the
next
train
back
to
New
York
''
.
``
Were
you
on
duty
here
two
weeks
ago
''
?
?
The
boy
hesitated
.
Then
,
``
I'm
not
talking
.
But
I
wouldn't
spend
a
night
in
here
for
a
million
bucks
''
!
!
He
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
room
.
Alec
gave
him
a
tip
and
let
him
go
.
Alone
,
Alec
examined
the
doors
.
There
were
three
--
one
leading
to
a
bathroom
,
one
to
the
hall
,
and
one
to
the
room
next
door
which
was
immovable
--
locked
or
bolted
on
the
other
side
.
Alec
locked
the
hall
door
and
put
the
key
with
his
watch
on
the
bedside
table
.
It
was
just
quarter
of
nine
.
As
he
ranged
his
belongings
on
the
bureau
he
noticed
a
film
of
white
dust
on
the
dark
surface
of
the
wood
beyond
the
linen
cover
.
Not
gray
like
the
dust
that
collects
in
an
unused
room
,
but
white
.
Women
didn't
use
white
face
powder
nowadays
,
he
recalled
.
They
used
pink
,
tan
,
or
cream
powder
.
Alec
glanced
into
the
bathroom
.
Blood
in
the
bathtub
where
the
murderer
appears
to
have
washed
his
hands
.
It
seemed
clean
now
,
but
Alec
decided
against
a
bath
.
He
crawled
into
bed
and
switched
off
the
light
.
In
the
darkness
he
could
see
the
rosy
reflection
of
the
neon
sign
on
the
wall
opposite
the
window
.
It
winked
as
steadily
as
a
metronome
--
on
,
off
--
on
,
off
.
In
less
than
five
minutes
Alec
was
asleep
.
He
never
knew
just
what
woke
him
.
Yet
suddenly
he
was
wide-awake
.
There
was
no
sound
and
apparently
no
movement
in
the
room
except
the
noiseless
pulsation
of
the
red
light
on
the
wall
.
He
lay
still
,
listening
to
the
silence
,
watching
the
light
.
