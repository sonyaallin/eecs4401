After
that
,
we
began
to
get
``
visitors
''
to
class
.
This
experimental
class
represented
quite
a
variety
of
students
.
It
ranged
from
a
freshman
woman
,
just
married
,
through
the
various
academic
growth
stages
,
including
one
senior-graduate
student
,
to
a
young
faculty
member
recently
married
to
a
senior
man
who
also
attended
.
It
ranged
from
those
with
no
children
,
through
students
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
,
to
one
44-year-old
male
with
four
children
,
three
of
whom
were
teenagers
.
It
ranged
from
two
women
members
who
had
experienced
premarital
pregnancy
to
one
couple
twelve
years
married
and
seemingly
unable
to
conceive
.
One
might
digress
at
this
point
and
speculate
that
if
it
is
``
wise
''
to
create
special
sections
for
special
status
,
then
why
not
a
special
section
for
women
pregnant
before
marriage
,
and
one
for
44-year-old
men
with
teenage
children
,
and
so
on
.
Some
of
these
speculations
may
have
some
merit
,
others
are
somewhat
ambiguous
.
But
few
who
have
experienced
marriage
can
dispute
the
fact
that
the
focus
of
interpersonal
relationships
is
different
in
marriage
than
in
a
pre-marital
situation
.
The
writer
began
this
special
class
by
explaining
his
background
thinking
for
creating
such
a
section
in
the
first
place
.
He
made
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
this
was
the
students'
opportunity
,
and
that
the
future
destiny
of
such
groups
depended
on
favorable
results
from
this
one
.
He
did
build
a
framework
of
academic
``
respectability
''
,
and
one
which
did
not
encroach
upon
the
``
sacred
sovereignty
''
of
any
other
existing
campus
course
.
This
is
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
course
in
wise
buying
or
money
spending
methods
,
nor
a
course
in
how
to
raise
children
.
We
already
have
courses
covering
those
problems
,
and
so
on
.
But
within
that
framework
he
allowed
for
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
.
A
steering
committee
of
students
was
organized
on
the
first
day
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
alert
and
constantly
evaluate
and
re-evaluate
the
direction
and
pace
the
class
was
taking
.
The
writer
,
being
cognizant
through
his
interviews
of
the
reactions
of
previous
married
students
,
did
insist
on
there
being
included
some
``
hindsight
''
material
.
But
the
greater
part
of
semester
time
was
actually
centered
around
the
attitudes
:
``
So
we
are
married
--
now
how
do
we
make
the
best
of
it
''
?
?
Or
``
How
do
we
enrich
our
already
fine
marriage
''
?
?
Films
were
used
,
as
with
all
sections
,
but
with
one
big
difference
.
Our
campus
,
unfortunately
,
owns
no
films
.
Since
they
are
all
either
rented
or
borrowed
,
the
requested
dates
for
their
use
have
to
be
far
in
advance
.
The
writer
never
knew
from
week
to
week
just
where
the
section
might
be
.
For
example
,
the
steering
committee
might
announce
that
the
group
felt
a
topic
under
study
should
not
be
dropped
for
an
additional
week
as
there
was
still
too
much
of
it
untouched
.
Since
the
writer
had
established
this
democratic
procedure
in
the
beginning
he
had
to
go
along
with
their
decision
--
after
,
of
course
,
pointing
out
whether
he
thought
their
decision
was
a
wise
or
an
unwise
one
.
Thus
the
films
seen
as
they
came
in
(
coordinated
for
the
regular
sections
)
,
were
often
out
of
context
.
Nevertheless
,
the
writer
has
never
experienced
such
spontaneity
of
discussion
after
film
showings
.
Though
it
did
not
become
known
to
the
writer
for
some
time
,
a
nucleus
group
had
sprung
up
within
the
class
.
They
began
to
meet
in
the
evenings
and
carry
forward
various
discussions
they
felt
not
fully
enough
covered
in
class
.
From
a
few
students
this
group
gradually
increased
to
include
over
three-fourths
of
those
officially
enrolled
in
the
class
,
and
many
outsiders
as
well
.
Also
,
although
only
a
few
of
the
students
were
intimately
acquainted
with
each
other
in
the
beginning
,
most
reported
that
when
the
semester
ended
their
dearest
and
closest
campus
friendships
were
with
members
of
that
class
.
In
fact
,
they
often
revamped
their
social
activities
to
include
class
members
previously
unknown
.
Supplemental
outside
reading
reports
were
handled
just
as
in
the
other
sections
,
the
major
difference
being
that
there
was
a
noticeably
deeper
level
in
the
reported
outside
reading
by
the
married
group
.
These
students
,
although
they
might
read
various
articles
in
popular
magazines
,
more
often
chose
to
report
on
articles
found
in
the
journals
.
In
addition
to
the
noticeable
difference
in
outside
articles
,
there
was
a
considerable
difference
in
the
outside
books
they
read
.
Whereas
a
high
percentage
of
the
regular
students
can
be
expected
to
read
other
texts
which
more
or
less
plow
the
same
ground
in
a
little
different
direction
,
the
married
students
chose
whole
books
on
specific
areas
and
went
into
much
greater
detail
in
their
areas
of
interest
.
Since
the
writer
had
not
noticed
this
characteristic
in
married
students
scattered
throughout
the
various
sections
previous
to
this
experiment
,
nor
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
in
those
who
were
continuing
in
``
single
sections
''
,
he
can
only
conclude
that
there
must
have
been
something
``
contagious
''
within
the
specific
group
which
caused
this
to
occur
.
In
the
main
,
this
course
took
the
following
directional
high
roads
.
(
1
)
A
great
deal
of
time
was
spent
on
processes
for
solving
marital
differences
.
This
was
not
a
search
for
a
``
magic
formula
''
,
but
rather
an
examination
of
basic
principles
pertaining
especially
to
all
types
of
communication
in
marriage
.
In
short
,
it
was
centered
around
learning
how
to
develop
a
more
sensitive
empathy
.
Not
until
the
group
was
satisfied
in
this
area
were
they
willing
to
venture
further
to
(
2
)
,
Specific
adjustment
areas
,
such
as
sex
,
in-laws
,
religion
,
finance
,
and
so
on
.
From
here
they
proceeded
to
(
3
)
These
same
areas
in
relation
to
their
own
future
family
life
stages
,
developing
these
to
the
extent
of
examining
various
crises
which
could
be
expected
to
confront
them
at
some
time
or
other
.
As
an
example
of
this
last
facet
,
there
were
some
lengthy
discussions
centered
around
bereavement
.
Mainly
these
were
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
the
death
of
one
parent
and
the
complication
of
living
with
the
survivor
afterward
,
but
the
possible
death
of
one's
own
spouse
was
not
overlooked
.
Since
the
course
,
one
member
has
lost
her
husband
.
This
was
not
a
particularly
shocking
or
unexpected
thing
--
it
was
previously
known
to
her
that
it
might
happen
.
But
just
when
was
an
unknown
,
and
of
course
the
longer
it
did
not
happen
,
the
stronger
her
wish
and
belief
that
it
might
not
.
Since
her
bereavement
this
individual
has
reported
to
the
writer
on
numerous
occasions
about
how
helpful
the
class
discussions
were
to
her
in
this
adjustment
crisis
.
Quite
frequently
class
members
brought
questions
from
their
mates
at
home
.
These
were
often
carefully
written
out
with
a
great
deal
of
thought
behind
them
.
This
added
a
personal
zest
to
class
discussions
and
participation
.
Both
sexes
reported
that
the
discussions
on
sex
adjustment
within
marriage
were
extremely
enlightening
.
The
writer
sensed
a
much
freer
and
more
frank
discussion
,
especially
of
this
one
area
,
than
ever
before
.
He
felt
certain
for
the
first
time
in
his
teaching
experience
that
the
men
in
the
class
understood
that
orgasm
,
as
a
criterion
,
is
not
nearly
so
essential
for
a
satisfying
female
sexual
experience
as
most
males
might
think
.
This
was
probably
much
more
meaningful
because
all
the
women
in
the
class
emphasized
it
time
and
again
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
women
class
members
appeared
to
reach
a
far
greater
understanding
than
have
women
members
in
other
sections
that
it
is
more
natural
for
males
as
a
group
to
view
sex
as
sex
rather
than
always
associating
it
with
love
as
most
women
seem
to
do
.
In
the
reproductive
area
it
could
be
readily
observed
that
all
felt
freer
to
discuss
things
than
students
had
previously
in
``
mixed
''
marital
status
sections
.
Perhaps
this
was
related
to
the
fact
that
all
were
in
on
it
to
some
extent
.
Never
in
other
sections
has
there
been
the
opportunity
for
the
genuine
down-to-earth
discussions
about
the
feelings
of
both
spouses
during
various
stages
of
pregnancy
.
There
was
a
particularly
marvelous
opportunity
for
study
in
this
area
since
almost
every
stage
of
pregnancy
was
represented
,
from
a
childless
couple
to
and
including
every
trimester
.
In
fact
,
we
had
one
birth
before
the
end
of
the
course
,
and
another
student
had
to
take
the
final
examiantion
a
week
early
,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
There
was
also
one
spontaneous
abortion
during
the
semester
.
Thus
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
groups
in
their
performance
on
this
task
after
a
brief
``
structuring
''
experience
.
It
was
predicted
that
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
would
adhere
to
more
liberal
,
concretistic
reports
of
what
the
ambiguous
figure
``
looked
like
''
as
reflecting
their
hesitancy
about
taking
chances
.
This
was
true
mostly
of
those
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
who
did
not
perceive
the
ambiguous
figure
as
people
in
action
.
Responses
such
as
``
rope
with
a
loop
in
it
''
,
and
``
two
pieces
of
rope
''
,
were
quite
characteristic
.
Guilford-Martin
personality
inventories
.
The
three
personality
inventories
(
Guilford
;
;
Guilford-Martin
;
;
Guilford-Martin
)
were
filled
out
by
12
of
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
and
19
of
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
.
These
were
the
same
subjects
who
were
given
the
Rorschach
test
.
Some
predictions
had
been
made
concerning
factors
R
,
N
,
I
and
Co
on
these
inventories
which
appeared
to
be
directly
related
to
control
and
security
aspects
of
personality
functioning
which
were
hypothesized
as
being
of
importance
in
differential
Kohnstamm
reactivity
.
Only
Co
differentiated
between
the
two
groups
at
less
than
the
5%
level
(
Af
)
.
One
prediction
had
been
made
about
the
difference
in
security
or
self-confidence
between
those
subjects
who
shifted
their
Kohnstamm
reactivity
when
informed
and
those
who
did
not
.
The
nonreactors
had
been
separated
into
two
groups
on
this
assumption
with
the
presumably
``
secure
''
nonreactors
and
``
secure
''
reactors
being
used
as
the
groups
for
comparative
personality
studies
.
It
was
predicted
that
those
who
shifted
in
their
Kohnstamm
reactivity
would
differ
significantly
from
those
who
did
not
on
the
factor
I
which
the
investigators
refer
to
as
the
``
Inferiority
''
factor
.
All
of
the
subjects
in
the
Kohnstamm-negative
and
Kohnstamm-positive
groups
(
as
defined
for
purposes
of
the
personality
studies
)
were
compared
with
those
subjects
who
shifted
in
Conditions
3
,
or
4
.
A
t
test
on
these
two
groups
,
shifters
vs.
nonshifters
,
gave
a
``
t
''
value
of
2.405
which
is
significant
on
the
two-tail
test
at
the
level
.
Discussion
individual
differences
Individual
differences
in
Kohnstamm
reactivity
to
controlled
Kohnstamm
situations
were
found
among
the
subjects
used
in
the
study
.
Only
27%
(
11
subjects
)
gave
a
positive
Kohnstamm
reaction
when
completely
naive
concerning
the
phenomenon
.
There
were
49%
(
20
subjects
)
who
did
not
give
a
positive
reaction
even
after
they
were
informed
of
the
normalcy
of
such
a
reaction
and
had
been
given
a
demonstration
.
There
were
24%
(
10
subjects
)
who
shifted
from
a
negative
to
a
positive
reaction
after
they
were
reassured
as
to
the
normalcy
of
the
Kohnstamm-positive
reaction
.
Among
this
latter
group
there
were
also
differences
in
the
amount
and
kind
of
information
necessary
before
a
shift
in
reaction
occurred
.
One
subject
changed
when
given
only
the
information
that
some
people
have
something
happen
to
their
arm
when
they
relax
.
Five
subjects
(
12%
)
did
not
change
until
they
had
been
told
that
some
people
have
something
happen
to
their
arm
,
what
that
something
was
,
and
also
were
given
a
demonstration
.
Four
subjects
(
10%
)
did
not
change
even
then
but
needed
the
additional
information
that
an
arm-elevation
under
these
circumstances
was
a
perfectly
normal
reflex
reaction
which
some
people
showed
while
others
did
not
.
At
no
time
was
it
implied
by
the
experimenter
that
the
subject's
initial
reaction
was
deviant
.
The
subjects
were
only
given
information
about
other
possibilities
of
``
normal
''
reaction
.
Those
who
responded
with
an
arm-elevation
in
the
naive
state
did
not
change
their
reaction
when
told
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
did
not
react
in
this
fashion
.
This
information
was
accepted
with
the
frequent
interpretation
that
those
persons
who
did
not
show
arm-levitation
must
be
preventing
it
.
These
subjects
implied
that
they
too
could
prevent
their
arms
from
rising
if
they
tried
.
The
positive
Kohnstamm
reactivity
in
Condition
1
(
(
the
naive
state
)
is
not
adequately
explained
by
such
a
concept
as
suggestibility
(
if
suggestibility
is
defined
as
the
influence
on
behavior
by
verbal
cues
)
.
In
no
way
,
either
verbally
or
behaviorally
,
did
the
experimenter
indicate
to
the
subjects
any
preferred
mode
of
responding
to
the
voluntary
contraction
.
Moreover
,
when
the
experimenter
did
inform
those
subjects
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
did
not
have
their
arm
rise
once
they
relaxed
,
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
were
uninfluenced
in
their
subsequent
reactions
to
the
Kohnstamm
situation
.
They
continued
to
give
an
arm-elevation
.
A
differential
suggestibility
would
have
to
be
invoked
to
explain
the
failure
of
this
additional
information
to
influence
the
Kohnstamm-positive
reactors
and
yet
attribute
their
naive
Kohnstamm
reactivity
to
suggestion
.
Autosuggestibility
,
the
reaction
of
the
subject
in
such
a
way
as
to
conform
to
his
own
expectations
of
the
outcome
(
i.e.
,
that
the
arm-rise
is
a
reaction
to
the
pressure
exerted
in
the
voluntary
contraction
,
because
of
his
knowledge
that
``
to
every
reaction
there
is
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
''
)
also
seems
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
the
following
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
subjects'
apparently
genuine
experience
of
surprise
when
their
arms
rose
,
and
(
2
)
manifestations
of
the
phenomenon
despite
anticipations
of
something
else
happening
(
e.g.
,
of
becoming
dizzy
and
maybe
falling
,
an
expectation
spontaneously
volunteered
by
one
of
the
subjects
)
.
A
suggestion
Hypothesis
also
seems
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
those
who
shifted
their
reactions
after
they
were
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
``
normal
''
reactions
different
from
those
which
they
gave
.
While
they
were
told
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
reacted
differently
than
they
had
,
they
were
also
informed
that
there
were
other
normals
who
reacted
as
they
had
.
There
was
no
implication
made
that
their
initial
reaction
(
absence
of
an
arm-elevation
)
was
less
preferred
than
the
presence
of
levitation
.
A
more
tenable
explanation
for
the
change
in
reactions
is
that
the
added
knowledge
and
increased
familiarity
with
the
total
situation
made
it
possible
for
these
subjects
to
be
less
guarded
and
to
relax
,
since
any
reaction
seemed
acceptable
to
the
examiner
as
``
normal
''
.
The
naive
state
,
Condition
1
,
,
could
therefore
be
viewed
as
an
inhibiting
one
for
24%
of
the
subjects
in
this
study
.
They
were
not
free
to
be
themselves
in
this
situation
,
an
interpersonal
one
,
where
there
was
an
observer
of
their
reactions
and
they
had
no
guide
for
acceptable
behavior
.
Instructions
to
relax
,
i.e.
,
to
be
``
spontaneous
''
,
and
react
immediately
to
whatever
impulse
they
might
have
,
was
not
sufficiently
reassuring
until
some
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
had
been
given
.
While
other
conditions
might
be
even
more
effective
in
bringing
about
a
change
from
immobility
to
mobility
in
Kohnstamm
reactivity
,
it
is
our
hypothesis
that
all
such
conditions
would
have
as
a
common
factor
the
capacity
to
induce
an
attitude
in
the
subject
which
enabled
him
to
divorce
himself
temporarily
from
feelings
of
responsibility
for
his
behavior
.
Alcohol
ingestion
succeeded
in
changing
immobility
to
mobility
quite
strikingly
in
one
pilot
subject
(
the
only
one
with
whom
this
technique
was
tried
)
.
This
subject
,
who
has
been
undergoing
psychoanalytic
psychotherapy
for
five
years
,
did
not
give
a
positive
Kohnstamm
reaction
under
any
of
the
four
standardized
conditions
used
in
this
experiment
while
sober
.
After
two
drinks
containing
alcohol
,
her
arm
flew
upward
very
freely
.
There
was
evident
delight
on
the
part
of
the
subject
in
response
to
her
experience
of
the
freedom
of
movement
.
She
described
herself
as
having
the
same
kind
of
``
irresponsible
''
feeling
as
she
had
once
experienced
under
hypnosis
.
She
ascribed
her
delight
with
both
experiences
to
the
effect
they
seemed
to
have
of
temporarily
removing
from
her
the
controls
which
she
felt
so
compulsively
necessary
to
maintain
even
when
it
might
seem
appropriate
to
relax
these
controls
.
Many
subjects
attributed
differences
in
Kohnstamm
reactivity
to
differences
in
degrees
of
subjective
control
--
voluntary
as
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
perceived
it
and
involuntary
as
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
perceived
it
.
These
suggested
interpretations
were
given
by
the
subjects
spontaneously
when
they
were
told
that
there
were
people
who
reacted
differently
than
they
had
.
The
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
described
the
vivid
experience
of
having
their
arms
rise
as
one
in
which
they
exercised
no
control
.
They
explained
its
absence
in
others
on
the
basis
of
an
intervention
of
control
factors
.
They
felt
that
they
too
could
counteract
the
upward
arm
movement
by
a
voluntary
effort
after
they
had
once
experienced
the
reaction
.
Some
of
those
who
did
not
initially
react
with
an
arm-elevation
also
associated
their
behavior
in
the
situation
with
control
factors
--
an
inability
to
relinquish
control
voluntarily
.
One
subject
spontaneously
asked
(
after
her
arm
had
finally
risen
)
,
``
Do
you
suppose
I
was
unconsciously
keeping
it
down
before
''
?
?
Another
said
that
her
arm
did
not
go
up
at
first
``
because
I
wouldn't
let
it
;
;
I
thought
it
wasn't
supposed
to
''
.
This
subject
was
one
who
gave
an
arm-elevation
on
the
second
trial
in
the
naive
state
but
not
in
the
first
.
She
had
felt
that
her
arm
wanted
to
go
up
in
the
first
trial
,
but
had
consciously
prevented
it
from
so
doing
.
She
explained
nonreactivity
of
others
by
saying
that
they
were
``
not
letting
themselves
relax
''
.
When
informed
that
there
were
some
persons
who
did
not
have
their
arm
go
up
,
she
commented
,
``
I
don't
see
how
they
can
prevent
it
''
.
In
contrast
to
this
voluntary-control
explanation
for
nonreactivity
given
by
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
,
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
offered
an
involuntary-control
hypothesis
to
explain
nonreactivity
.
They
felt
that
they
were
relaxing
as
much
as
they
could
and
that
any
control
factors
which
might
be
present
to
prevent
response
must
be
on
an
unconscious
level
.
The
above
discussion
does
not
mean
to
imply
that
control
factors
were
completely
in
abeyance
in
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
;
;
but
rather
that
they
could
be
diminished
sufficiently
not
to
interfere
with
arm-levitation
.
One
Kohnstamm-positive
subject
who
had
both
arms
rise
while
being
tested
in
the
naive
condition
described
her
subjective
experience
as
follows
:
``
You
feel
they're
going
up
and
you're
on
a
stage
and
it's
not
right
for
them
to
do
so
and
then
you
think
maybe
that's
what's
supposed
to
happen
''
.
She
then
described
her
experience
as
one
in
which
she
first
had
difficulty
accepting
for
herself
a
state
of
being
in
which
she
relinquished
control
.
However
,
she
was
able
to
relax
and
yield
to
the
moment
.
It
is
our
hypothesis
that
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
are
less
hesitant
about
relinquishing
control
than
are
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
;
;
that
they
can
give
up
their
control
and
allow
themselves
to
be
reactors
rather
than
actors
.
It
is
our
belief
that
this
readiness
to
relinquish
some
control
was
evidenced
by
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
in
some
of
the
other
experimental
situations
to
be
discussed
below
.
Thus
,
this
readiness
to
relax
controls
,
evidenced
in
the
Kohnstamm
situation
,
appears
to
be
a
more
general
personality
factor
.
Aniseikonic
illusion
The
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
seemed
to
be
freer
to
experience
the
unusual
and
seemingly
impossible
in
the
external
world
.
There
was
a
significantly
greater
number
in
this
group
who
reported
a
desk
as
being
in
a
tilted
position
while
a
tennis
ball
resting
on
it
remained
stationary
on
the
incline
.
This
occurred
in
spite
of
the
rational
awareness
that
the
ball
should
be
going
downhill
.
They
knew
that
their
perceptual
experience
differed
from
objective
reality
since
they
had
seen
the
desk
and
ball
prior
to
putting
on
the
aniseikonic
lenses
.
Yet
they
were
not
so
bound
by
past
experience
and
constriction
as
to
deny
their
immediate
perceptions
and
to
be
dominated
by
their
knowledge
of
what
the
experience
should
be
.
The
change
in
perceptions
by
some
of
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
,
after
they
had
been
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
,
suggests
that
their
constriction
and
guardedness
is
associated
with
their
general
mode
of
responding
to
strange
or
unknown
situations
.
They
were
able
to
experience
at
first
,
in
terms
of
past
conventionality
.
When
informed
as
to
the
various
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
,
they
were
then
able
to
experience
the
uniqueness
of
the
present
.
It
might
be
postulated
that
these
subjects
are
unduly
afraid
of
being
wrong
;
;
that
they
perceive
new
internal
and
environmental
situations
as
``
threatening
''
until
they
are
tested
and
proved
otherwise
.
While
the
interpretations
that
have
been
given
are
inferences
only
,
they
gain
support
from
such
comments
as
the
following
,
which
was
made
by
one
of
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
who
did
not
,
on
the
first
trial
,
perceive
the
tilt
illusion
.
Control
of
socioeconomic
status
It
would
have
been
desirable
for
the
two
communities
to
have
differed
only
in
respect
to
the
variable
being
investigated
:
the
degree
of
structure
in
teaching
method
.
The
structured
schools
were
in
an
industrial
city
,
with
three-family
tenement
houses
typical
of
the
residential
areas
,
but
with
one
rather
sizable
section
of
middle-class
homes
.
The
unstructured
schools
were
in
a
large
suburban
community
,
predominantly
middle-
to
upper-middle
class
,
but
fringed
by
an
industrial
area
.
In
order
to
equate
the
samples
on
socioeconomic
status
,
we
chose
schools
in
both
cities
on
the
basis
of
socioeconomic
status
of
the
neighborhoods
.
School
principals
and
guidance
workers
made
ratings
of
the
various
neighborhoods
and
the
research
team
made
independent
observations
of
houses
and
dwelling
areas
.
An
objective
scale
was
developed
for
rating
school
neighborhoods
from
these
data
.
Equal
proportions
of
children
in
each
city
were
drawn
from
upper-lower
and
lower-middle
class
neighborhoods
.
Subjects
Individual
differences
in
maturation
and
the
development
of
readiness
for
learning
to
read
indicate
that
not
until
the
third
grade
have
most
children
had
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
capacity
for
school
achievement
.
Therefore
,
third-grade
children
were
chosen
as
subjects
for
this
study
.
For
purposes
of
sample
selection
only
(
individual
tests
were
given
later
)
we
obtained
group
test
scores
of
reading
achievement
and
intelligence
from
school
records
of
the
entire
third-grade
population
in
each
school
system
.
The
subjects
for
this
study
were
randomly
selected
from
stratified
areas
of
the
distribution
,
one-third
as
underachievers
,
one-third
medium
,
and
one-third
over-achievers
.
Children
whose
reading
scores
were
at
least
one
standard
deviation
below
the
regression
line
of
each
total
third-grade
school
population
were
considered
under-achievers
for
the
purposes
of
sample
selection
.
Over-achievers
were
at
least
one
standard
deviation
above
the
regression
line
in
their
school
system
.
The
final
sample
was
not
significantly
different
from
a
normal
distribution
in
regard
to
reading
achievement
or
intelligence
test
scores
.
Twenty-four
classrooms
in
twelve
unstructured
schools
furnished
156
cases
,
87
boys
and
69
girls
.
Eight
classrooms
in
three
structured
schools
furnished
72
cases
,
36
boys
and
36
girls
.
Administrative
restrictions
necessitated
the
smaller
sample
size
in
the
structured
schools
.
It
was
assumed
that
the
sampling
procedure
was
purely
random
with
respect
to
the
personality
variables
under
investigation
.
Rating
scale
of
compulsivity
An
interview
schedule
of
open-ended
questions
and
a
multiple-choice
questionnaire
were
prepared
,
and
one
parent
of
each
of
the
sample
children
was
seen
in
the
home
.
The
parent
was
asked
to
describe
the
child's
typical
behavior
in
certain
standard
situations
in
which
there
was
an
opportunity
to
observe
tendencies
toward
perfectionism
in
demands
upon
self
and
others
,
irrational
conformity
to
rules
,
orderliness
,
punctuality
,
and
need
for
certainty
.
The
interviewers
were
instructed
not
to
suggest
answers
and
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
record
the
parents'
actual
words
as
they
described
the
child's
behavior
in
home
situations
.
The
rating
scale
of
compulsivity
was
constructed
by
first
perusing
the
interview
records
,
categorizing
all
evidence
related
to
compulsivity
,
then
arranging
a
distribution
of
such
information
apart
from
the
case
records
.
Final
ratings
were
made
on
the
basis
of
a
point
system
which
was
developed
after
studying
the
distributions
of
actual
behaviors
recorded
and
assigning
weight
values
to
each
type
of
behavior
that
was
deviant
from
the
discovered
norms
.
Children
scoring
high
in
compulsivity
were
those
who
gave
evidence
of
tension
or
emotionality
in
situations
where
there
was
lack
of
organization
or
conformity
to
standards
and
expectations
,
or
who
made
exaggerated
efforts
to
achieve
these
goals
.
The
low
compulsive
child
was
one
who
appeared
relatively
unconcerned
about
such
matters
.
For
instance
,
the
following
statement
was
rated
low
in
compulsivity
,
``
She's
naturally
quite
neat
about
things
,
but
it
doesn't
bother
her
at
all
if
her
room
gets
messy
.
But
she
cleans
it
up
very
well
when
I
remind
her
''
.
Measurement
of
anxiety
Castaneda
,
et
al
revised
the
Taylor
Anxiety
Scale
for
use
with
children
.
The
Taylor
Scale
was
adapted
from
the
Minnesota
Multiphastic
Personality
Inventory
,
with
item
selection
based
upon
clinical
definitions
of
anxiety
.
There
is
much
research
evidence
to
validate
the
use
of
the
instrument
in
differentiating
individuals
who
are
likely
to
manifest
anxiety
in
varying
degrees
.
Reliability
and
validation
work
with
the
Children's
Anxiety
Scale
by
Castaneda
,
et
al
demonstrated
results
closely
similar
to
the
findings
with
the
adult
scale
.
Although
the
Taylor
Scale
was
designed
as
a
group
testing
device
,
in
this
study
it
was
individually
administered
by
psychologically
trained
workers
who
established
rapport
and
assisted
the
children
in
reading
the
items
.
Relationship
of
Anxiety
to
compulsivity
The
question
may
be
raised
whether
or
not
we
are
dealing
with
a
common
factor
in
anxiety
and
compulsivity
.
The
two
ratings
yield
a
correlation
of
,
which
is
not
significantly
different
from
zero
;
;
therefore
,
we
have
measured
two
different
characteristics
.
In
theory
,
compulsive
behavior
is
a
way
of
diminishing
anxiety
,
and
one
might
expect
a
negative
association
except
for
the
possibility
that
for
many
children
the
obsessive-compulsive
defenses
are
not
sufficient
to
quell
the
amount
of
anxiety
they
suffer
.
The
issue
of
interaction
between
anxiety
and
compulsivity
will
be
taken
up
later
.
Criterion
measurement
In
the
primary
grades
,
reading
permeates
almost
every
aspect
of
school
progress
,
and
the
children's
early
experiences
of
success
or
failure
in
learning
to
read
often
set
a
pattern
of
total
achievement
that
is
relatively
enduring
throughout
the
following
years
.
In
establishing
criterion
measurements
,
it
was
therefore
thought
best
to
broaden
the
scope
beyond
the
reading
act
itself
.
The
predicted
interaction
effect
should
,
if
potent
,
extend
its
influence
over
all
academic
achievement
.
The
Stanford
Achievement
Test
,
Form
J
,
was
administered
by
classroom
teachers
,
consisting
of
a
battery
of
six
sub-tests
:
Paragraph
Meaning
,
Word
Meaning
,
Spelling
,
Language
,
Arithmetic
Computation
,
and
Arithmetic
Reasoning
.
All
of
these
sub-tests
involve
reading
except
Arithmetic
Computation
.
Scores
are
stated
in
grade-equivalents
on
a
national
norm
.
The
battery
median
grade-equivalent
was
used
in
data
analysis
in
this
study
.
The
Wechsler
Intelligence
Scale
For
Children
was
administered
to
each
sample
third-grade
child
by
a
clinical
worker
.
The
relationship
of
intelligence
test
scores
to
school
achievement
is
a
well-established
fact
(
in
this
case
,
Af
)
;
;
therefore
,
in
the
investigation
of
the
present
hypothesis
,
it
was
necessary
to
control
this
factor
.
The
criterion
score
used
in
the
statistical
analysis
is
an
index
of
over-
or
under-achievement
.
It
is
the
discrepancy
between
the
actual
attained
achievement
test
score
and
the
score
that
would
be
predicted
by
the
I.Q.
.
For
example
,
on
the
basis
of
the
regression
equation
,
a
child
with
an
I.Q.
of
120
in
this
sample
would
be
expected
to
earn
an
achievement
test
score
of
4.8
(
grade
equivalent
)
.
If
a
child
with
an
I.Q.
of
120
scored
5.5
in
achievement
,
his
discrepancy
score
would
be
,
representing
of
one
year
of
over-achievement
.
A
child
with
an
I.Q.
of
98
would
be
expected
to
earn
an
achievement
test
score
of
3.5
.
If
such
a
child
scored
3.0
,
his
discrepancy
score
would
be
-.5
,
representing
of
one
year
of
under-achievement
.
In
this
manner
,
the
factors
measured
by
the
intelligence
test
were
controlled
,
allowing
discovered
differences
in
achievement
to
be
interpreted
as
resulting
from
other
variables
.
Results
test
of
interaction
of
compulsivity
and
teaching
methods
Tables
1
and
2
present
the
results
of
the
statistical
analysis
of
the
data
when
compulsivity
is
used
as
the
descriptive
variable
.
Figure
1
portrays
the
mean
achievement
scores
of
each
sub-group
graphically
.
First
of
all
,
as
we
had
surmised
,
the
highly
compulsive
children
in
the
structured
setting
score
significantly
better
(
Af
)
on
achievement
than
do
similar
children
in
the
unstructured
schools
.
It
can
be
seen
too
that
when
we
contrast
levels
of
compulsivity
within
the
structured
schools
,
the
high
compulsive
children
do
better
(
Af
)
.
No
significant
difference
was
found
in
achievement
between
high
and
low
compulsive
children
within
the
unstructured
school
.
The
hypothesis
of
there
being
an
interaction
between
compulsivity
and
teaching
method
was
supported
,
in
this
case
,
at
the
level
.
While
we
had
expected
that
compulsive
children
in
the
unstructured
school
setting
would
have
difficulty
when
compared
to
those
in
the
structured
,
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
achievement
of
the
high
compulsives
within
the
schools
where
the
whole-word
method
is
used
in
beginning
reading
compares
favorably
with
that
of
the
low
compulsives
.
Indeed
their
achievement
scores
were
somewhat
better
on
an
absolute
basis
although
the
difference
was
not
significant
.
We
speculate
that
compulsives
in
the
unstructured
schools
are
under
greater
strain
because
of
the
lack
of
systemization
in
their
school
setting
,
but
that
their
need
to
organize
(
for
comfort
)
is
so
intense
that
they
struggle
to
induce
the
phonic
rules
and
achieve
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
direction
from
the
environment
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
medium
compulsives
in
the
unstructured
schools
made
the
lowest
achievement
scores
(
although
not
significantly
lower
)
.
Possibly
their
compulsivity
was
not
strong
enough
to
cause
them
to
build
their
own
structure
.
Our
conjecture
is
,
then
,
that
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
school
lessons
are
taught
,
the
compulsive
child
accentuates
those
elements
of
each
lesson
that
aid
him
in
systematizing
his
work
.
When
helped
by
a
high
degree
of
structure
in
lesson
presentation
,
then
,
and
only
then
,
does
such
a
child
attain
unusual
success
.
Test
of
interaction
of
anxiety
and
teaching
methods
The
statistical
analyses
of
achievement
in
relation
to
anxiety
and
teaching
methods
and
the
interactions
of
the
two
are
presented
in
Tables
3
and
4
.
Figure
2
is
a
graph
of
the
mean
achievement
scores
of
each
group
.
As
predicted
,
the
highly
anxious
children
in
the
unstructured
schools
score
more
poorly
(
Af
)
than
those
in
the
structured
schools
.
The
interaction
effect
,
which
is
significant
at
the
level
,
can
be
seen
best
in
the
contrast
of
mean
scores
.
While
high
anxiety
children
achieve
significantly
less
well
(
Af
)
in
the
unstructured
school
than
do
low
anxiety
children
,
they
appear
to
do
at
least
as
well
as
the
average
in
the
structured
classroom
.
The
most
striking
aspect
of
the
interaction
demonstrated
is
the
marked
decrement
in
performance
suffered
by
the
highly
anxious
children
in
unstructured
schools
.
According
to
the
theory
proposed
,
this
is
a
consequence
of
the
severe
condition
of
perceived
threat
that
persists
unabated
for
the
anxious
child
in
an
ambiguous
sort
of
school
environment
.
The
fact
that
such
threat
is
potent
in
the
beginning
reading
lessons
is
thought
to
be
a
vital
factor
in
the
continued
pattern
of
failure
or
under-achievement
these
children
exhibit
.
The
child
with
high
anxiety
may
first
direct
his
anxiety-released
energy
toward
achievement
,
but
because
his
distress
severely
reduces
the
abilities
of
discrimination
and
memorization
of
complex
symbols
,
the
child
may
fail
in
his
initial
attempts
to
master
the
problem
.
Failure
confirms
the
threat
,
and
the
intensity
of
anxiety
is
increased
as
the
required
learning
becomes
more
difficult
,
so
that
by
the
time
the
child
reaches
the
third
grade
the
decrement
in
performance
is
pronounced
.
The
individual
with
high
anxiety
in
the
structured
classroom
may
approach
the
learning
task
with
the
same
increased
energy
and
lowered
powers
of
discrimination
.
But
the
symbols
he
is
asked
to
learn
are
simple
.
As
shown
earlier
,
the
highly
anxious
individual
may
be
superior
in
his
memorizing
of
simple
elements
.
Success
reduces
the
prospect
of
threat
and
his
powers
of
discrimination
are
improved
.
By
the
time
the
child
first
attacks
the
actual
problem
of
reading
,
he
is
completely
familiar
and
at
ease
with
all
of
the
elements
of
words
.
Apparently
academic
challenge
in
the
structured
setting
creates
an
optimum
of
stress
so
that
the
child
with
high
anxiety
is
able
to
achieve
because
he
is
aroused
to
an
energetic
state
without
becoming
confused
or
panicked
.
Sarason
et
al
present
evidence
that
the
anxious
child
will
suffer
in
the
test-like
situation
,
and
that
his
performance
will
be
impaired
unless
he
receives
supporting
and
accepting
treatment
from
the
teacher
.
Although
the
present
study
was
not
a
direct
replication
of
their
investigations
,
the
results
do
not
confirm
their
conclusion
.
Observers
,
in
the
two
school
systems
studied
here
,
judged
the
teachers
in
the
structured
schools
to
be
more
impersonal
and
demanding
,
while
the
atmosphere
in
the
unstructured
schools
was
judged
to
be
more
supporting
and
accepting
.
Yet
the
highly
anxious
child
suffered
a
tremendous
disadvantage
only
in
the
unstructured
school
,
and
performed
as
well
or
better
than
average
in
the
structured
setting
.
Analysis
Analysis
means
the
evaluation
of
subparts
,
the
comparative
ratings
of
parts
,
the
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of
isolated
elements
.
Analysis
in
roleplaying
is
usually
done
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
strong
and
weak
points
of
an
individual
or
as
a
process
to
eliminate
weak
parts
and
strengthen
good
parts
.
Impersonal
purposes
Up
to
this
point
stress
has
been
placed
on
roleplaying
in
terms
of
individuals
.
Roleplaying
can
be
done
for
quite
a
different
purpose
:
to
evaluate
procedures
,
regardless
of
individuals
.
For
example
:
a
sales
presentation
can
be
analyzed
and
evaluated
through
roleplaying
.
Examples
Let
us
now
put
some
flesh
on
the
theoretical
bones
we
have
assembled
by
giving
illustrations
of
roleplaying
used
for
evaluation
and
analysis
.
One
should
keep
in
mind
that
many
of
the
exciting
possiblities
of
roleplaying
are
largely
unexplored
and
have
not
been
used
in
industry
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
in
military
and
other
areas
.
Evaluation
The
president
of
a
small
firm
selling
restaurant
products
,
had
considerable
difficulty
in
finding
suitable
salesmen
for
his
business
.
Interviewing
,
checking
references
,
training
the
salesmen
,
having
them
go
with
more
experienced
salesmen
was
expensive
--
and
the
rate
of
attrition
due
to
resignations
or
unsatisfactory
performance
was
too
high
.
It
was
his
experience
that
only
one
good
salesman
was
found
out
of
every
seven
hired
--
and
only
one
was
hired
out
of
every
seven
interviewed
.
Roleplaying
was
offered
as
a
solution
--
and
the
procedure
worked
as
follows
:
all
candidates
were
invited
to
a
hotel
conference
room
,
where
the
president
explained
the
difficulty
he
had
,
and
how
unnecessary
it
seemed
to
him
to
hire
people
who
just
did
not
work
out
.
In
place
of
asking
salesmen
to
fill
questionnaires
,
checking
their
references
,
interviewing
them
,
asking
them
to
be
tried
out
,
he
told
them
he
would
prefer
to
test
them
.
Each
person
was
to
enter
the
testing
room
,
carrying
a
suitcase
of
samples
.
Each
salesman
was
to
read
a
sheet
containing
a
description
of
the
product
.
In
the
testing
room
he
was
to
make
,
successively
,
three
presentations
to
three
different
people
.
In
the
testing
room
,
three
of
the
veteran
salesmen
served
as
antagonists
.
One
handled
the
salesman
in
a
friendly
manner
,
another
in
a
rough
manner
,
and
the
third
in
a
hesitating
manner
.
Each
was
told
to
purchase
material
if
he
felt
like
it
.
The
antagonists
came
in
,
one
at
a
time
,
and
did
not
see
or
hear
the
other
presentations
.
After
each
presentation
,
the
antagonist
wrote
his
judgment
of
the
salesmen
;
;
and
so
did
the
observers
consisting
of
the
president
,
three
of
his
salesmen
and
a
psychologist
.
Ten
salesmen
were
tested
in
the
morning
and
ten
more
in
the
afternoon
.
This
procedure
was
repeated
one
day
a
month
for
four
months
.
The
batting
average
of
one
success
out
of
seven
increased
to
one
out
of
three
.
The
president
of
the
firm
,
calculating
expenses
alone
,
felt
his
costs
had
dropped
one-half
while
success
in
selection
had
improved
over
one
hundred
per
cent
.
The
reason
for
the
value
of
this
procedure
was
simply
that
the
applicants
were
tested
``
at
work
''
in
different
situations
by
the
judgment
of
a
number
of
experts
who
could
see
how
the
salesmen
conducted
themselves
with
different
,
but
typical
restaurant
owners
and
managers
.
They
were
,
in
a
sense
,
``
tried
out
''
in
realistic
situations
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
applicants
,
less
time
was
wasted
in
being
evaluated
--
and
they
got
a
meal
out
of
it
as
well
as
some
insights
into
their
performances
.
Another
use
of
roleplaying
for
evaluation
illustrates
how
this
procedure
can
be
used
in
real
life
situations
without
special
equipment
or
special
assistants
during
the
daily
course
of
work
.
The
position
of
receptionist
was
opened
in
a
large
office
and
an
announcement
was
made
to
the
other
girls
already
working
that
they
could
apply
for
this
job
which
had
higher
prestige
and
slightly
higher
salary
than
typing
and
clerking
positions
.
All
applicants
were
generally
familiar
with
the
work
of
the
receptionist
.
At
the
end
of
work
one
day
,
the
personnel
man
took
the
applicants
one
at
a
time
,
asked
them
to
sit
behind
the
receptionist's
desk
and
he
then
played
the
role
of
a
number
of
people
who
might
come
to
the
receptionist
with
a
number
of
queries
and
for
a
number
of
purposes
.
Each
girl
was
independently
``
tested
''
by
the
personnel
man
,
and
he
served
not
only
as
the
director
,
but
as
the
antagonist
and
the
observer
.
Somewhat
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
one
girl
,
whom
he
would
never
have
considered
for
the
job
since
she
had
appeared
somewhat
mousy
and
also
had
been
in
the
office
a
relatively
short
time
,
did
the
most
outstanding
job
of
playing
the
role
of
receptionist
,
showing
wit
,
sparkle
,
and
aplomb
.
She
was
hired
and
was
found
to
be
entirely
satisfactory
when
she
played
the
role
eight
hours
a
day
.
Analysis
In
considering
roleplaying
for
analysis
we
enter
a
more
complex
area
,
since
we
are
now
no
longer
dealing
with
a
simple
over-all
decision
but
rather
with
the
examination
and
evaluation
of
many
elements
seen
in
dynamic
functioning
.
Some
cases
in
evidence
of
the
use
of
roleplaying
for
analysis
may
help
explain
the
procedure
.
An
engineer
had
been
made
the
works
manager
of
a
firm
,
supplanting
a
retired
employee
who
had
been
considered
outstandingly
successful
.
The
engineer
had
more
than
seven
years
of
experience
in
the
firm
,
was
well
trained
,
was
considered
a
hard
worker
,
was
respected
by
his
fellow
engineers
for
his
technical
competence
and
was
regarded
as
a
``
comer
''
.
However
,
he
turned
out
to
be
a
complete
failure
in
his
new
position
.
He
seemed
to
antagonize
everyone
.
Turnover
rates
of
personnel
went
up
,
production
dropped
,
and
morale
was
visibly
reduced
.
Despite
the
fact
that
he
was
regarded
as
an
outstanding
engineer
,
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
poor
administrator
,
although
no
one
quite
knew
what
was
wrong
with
him
.
At
the
insistence
of
his
own
supervisor
--
the
president
of
the
firm
--
he
enrolled
in
a
course
designed
to
develop
leaders
.
He
played
a
number
of
typical
situations
before
observers
,
other
supervisors
who
kept
notes
and
then
explained
to
him
in
detail
what
he
did
they
thought
was
wrong
.
Entirely
concerned
with
efficiency
,
he
was
merciless
in
criticizing
people
who
made
mistakes
,
condemning
them
to
too
great
an
extent
.
He
did
not
really
listen
to
others
,
had
little
interest
in
their
ideas
,
and
wanted
to
have
his
own
way
--
which
was
the
only
right
way
.
The
entire
group
of
managers
explained
,
in
great
detail
,
a
number
of
human
relations
errors
that
he
made
.
One
by
one
,
these
errors
were
discussed
and
one
by
one
he
rejected
accepting
them
as
errors
.
He
admitted
his
behavior
,
and
defended
it
.
He
refused
to
change
his
approach
,
and
instead
he
attacked
high
and
low
--
the
officials
for
their
not
backing
him
,
and
subordinates
for
their
laxness
,
stupidity
,
and
stubbornness
.
After
the
diagnosing
,
he
left
the
course
,
convinced
that
it
could
do
him
no
good
.
We
may
say
that
his
problem
was
diagnosed
but
that
he
refused
treatment
.
The
engineer
turned
works
manager
had
a
particular
view
of
life
--
and
refused
to
change
it
.
We
may
say
that
his
attitude
was
foolish
,
since
he
may
have
been
a
success
had
he
learned
some
human
relations
skills
;
;
or
we
may
say
that
his
attitude
was
commendable
,
showing
his
independence
of
mind
,
in
his
refusal
to
adjust
to
the
opinions
of
others
.
In
any
case
,
he
refused
to
accept
the
implications
of
the
analysis
,
that
he
needed
to
be
made
over
.
Another
case
may
be
given
in
illustration
of
a
successful
use
of
analysis
,
and
also
of
the
employment
of
a
procedure
for
intensive
analysis
.
In
a
course
for
supermarket
operators
,
a
district
manager
who
had
been
recently
appointed
to
his
position
after
being
outstandingly
successful
as
a
store
manager
,
found
that
in
supervising
other
managers
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
.
On
playing
some
typical
situations
before
a
jury
of
his
peers
he
showed
some
characteristics
rated
as
unsatisfactory
.
He
was
told
he
displayed
,
for
example
,
a
sense
of
superiority
--
and
he
answered
:
``
Well
,
I
am
supposed
to
know
all
the
answers
,
aren't
I
''
?
?
He
was
criticized
for
his
curtness
and
abruptness
--
and
he
answered
:
``
I
am
not
working
to
become
popular
''
.
On
being
criticized
for
his
arbitrary
behavior
--
he
answered
:
``
I
have
to
make
decisions
.
That's
my
job
''
.
In
short
,
as
frequently
happens
in
analyses
,
the
individual
feels
threatened
and
defends
himself
.
However
,
in
this
case
the
district
manager
was
led
to
see
the
errors
of
his
ways
.
The
necessary
step
between
diagnosis
and
training
is
acceptance
of
the
validity
of
the
criticisms
.
How
this
was
accomplished
may
be
described
,
since
this
sometimes
is
a
crucial
problem
.
The
director
helped
tailor-make
a
check
list
of
the
district
manager's
errors
by
asking
various
observers
to
write
out
sentences
commenting
on
the
mistakes
they
felt
he
made
.
These
errors
were
then
collected
and
written
on
a
blackboard
,
condensing
similar
ideas
.
Eighteen
errors
were
located
,
and
then
the
director
asked
each
individual
to
vote
whether
or
not
they
felt
that
this
manager
had
made
the
particular
errors
.
They
were
asked
to
vote
``
true
''
if
they
thought
they
had
seen
him
make
the
error
,
``
false
''
if
they
thought
he
had
not
;
;
and
``
cannot
say
''
if
they
were
not
certain
.
The
manager
sat
behind
the
group
so
he
could
see
and
count
the
hands
that
went
up
,
and
the
director
wrote
the
numbers
on
the
blackboard
.
No
comments
were
made
during
the
voting
.
The
results
looked
as
follows
:
Af
.
The
first
eight
of
these
eighteen
statements
,
which
received
at
least
one-half
of
the
votes
,
were
duplicated
to
form
an
analysis
checklist
for
the
particular
manager
,
and
when
this
particular
manager
roleplayed
in
other
situations
,
the
members
checked
any
items
that
appeared
.
To
prevent
the
manager
from
deliberately
controlling
himself
only
during
the
sessions
,
they
were
rather
lengthy
(
about
twenty
minutes
)
,
the
situations
were
imperfectly
described
to
the
manager
so
that
he
would
not
know
what
to
expect
,
new
antagonists
were
brought
on
the
scene
unexpectedly
,
and
the
antagonists
were
instructed
to
deliberately
behave
in
such
ways
as
to
upset
the
manager
and
get
him
to
operate
in
a
manner
for
which
he
had
been
previously
criticized
.
After
every
session
,
the
check
marks
were
totaled
up
and
graphed
,
and
in
this
way
the
supervisor's
progress
was
charted
.
Summary
In
life
we
learn
to
play
our
roles
and
we
``
freeze
''
into
patterns
which
become
so
habitual
that
we
are
not
really
aware
of
what
we
do
.
We
can
see
others
more
clearly
than
we
can
see
ourselves
,
and
others
can
see
us
better
than
we
see
ourselves
.
To
learn
what
we
do
is
the
first
step
for
improvement
.
To
accept
the
validity
of
the
judgments
of
others
is
the
second
step
.
To
want
to
change
is
the
third
step
.
To
practice
new
procedures
under
guided
supervision
and
with
constant
feedback
is
the
fourth
step
.
To
use
these
new
ways
in
daily
life
is
the
last
step
.
Roleplaying
used
for
analysis
follows
these
general
steps
leading
to
training
.
When
an
evaluative
situation
is
set
up
,
and
no
concern
is
with
the
details
that
lead
to
an
over-all
estimate
,
we
say
that
roleplaying
is
used
for
evaluation
.
Observers
can
see
a
person
engaged
in
spontaneous
behavior
,
and
watch
him
operating
in
a
totalistic
fashion
.
This
behavior
is
more
``
veridical
''
--
or
true
--
than
other
testing
behavior
for
some
types
of
evaluation
,
and
so
can
give
quick
and
accurate
estimates
of
complex
functioning
.
While
roleplaying
for
testing
is
not
too
well
understood
at
the
present
time
,
it
represents
one
of
the
major
uses
of
this
procedure
.
Chapter

,
spontaneity
training
the
objective
of
this
chapter
is
to
clarify
the
distinctions
between
spontaneity
theory
and
other
training
concepts
.
In
addition
,
the
basic
approach
utilized
in
applying
roleplaying
will
be
reviewed
.
The
goal
will
be
to
provide
the
reader
with
an
integrated
rationale
to
aid
him
in
applying
roleplaying
techniques
in
this
unique
training
area
.
The
reasons
for
extracting
this
particular
roleplaying
application
from
the
previous
discussion
of
training
are
twofold
.
1
.
Spontaneity
training
theory
is
unique
and
relatively
new
.
It
is
not
easy
for
the
therapist
to
discern
when
,
in
the
patient's
communicating
,
an
introject
has
appeared
and
is
holding
sway
.
One
learns
to
become
alert
to
changes
in
his
vocal
tone
--
to
his
voice's
suddenly
shifting
to
a
quality
not
like
his
usual
one
,
a
quality
which
sounds
somehow
artificial
or
,
in
some
instances
,
parrot-like
.
The
content
of
his
words
may
lapse
back
into
monotonous
repetition
,
as
if
a
phonograph
needle
were
stuck
in
one
groove
;
;
only
seldom
is
it
so
simple
as
to
be
a
matter
of
his
obviously
parroting
some
timeworn
axiom
,
common
to
our
culture
,
which
he
has
evidently
heard
,
over
and
over
,
from
a
parent
until
he
experiences
it
as
part
of
him
.
One
hebephrenic
woman
often
became
submerged
in
what
felt
to
me
like
a
somehow
phony
experience
of
pseudo-emotion
,
during
which
,
despite
her
wracking
sobs
and
streaming
cheeks
,
I
felt
only
a
cold
annoyance
with
her
.
Eventually
such
incidents
became
more
sporadic
,
and
more
sharply
demarcated
from
her
day-after-day
behavior
,
and
in
one
particular
session
,
after
several
minutes
of
such
behavior
--
which
,
as
usual
,
went
on
without
any
accompanying
words
from
her
--
she
asked
,
eagerly
,
``
Did
you
see
Granny
''
?
?
At
first
I
did
not
know
what
she
meant
;
;
I
thought
she
must
be
seeing
me
as
some
one
who
had
just
come
from
seeing
her
grandmother
,
in
their
distant
home-city
.
Then
I
realized
that
she
had
been
deliberately
showing
me
,
this
time
,
what
Granny
was
like
;
;
and
when
I
replied
in
this
spirit
,
she
corroborated
my
hunch
.
At
another
phase
in
the
therapy
,
when
a
pathogenic
mother-introject
began
to
emerge
more
and
more
upon
the
investigative
scene
,
she
muttered
in
a
low
but
intense
voice
,
to
herself
,
``
I
hate
that
woman
inside
me
''
!
!
I
could
evoke
no
further
elaboration
from
her
about
this
;
;
but
a
few
seconds
later
she
was
standing
directly
across
the
room
from
me
,
looking
me
in
the
eyes
and
saying
in
a
scathingly
condemnatory
tone
,
``
Your
father
despises
you
''
!
!
Again
,
I
at
first
misconstrued
this
disconcertingly
intense
communication
,
and
I
quickly
cast
through
my
mind
to
account
for
her
being
able
to
speak
,
with
such
utter
conviction
,
of
an
opinion
held
by
my
father
,
now
several
years
deceased
.
Then
I
replied
,
coldly
,
``
If
you
despise
me
,
why
don't
you
say
so
,
directly
''
?
?
She
looked
confused
at
this
,
and
I
felt
sure
it
had
been
a
wrong
response
for
me
to
make
.
It
then
occurred
to
me
to
ask
,
``
Is
that
what
that
woman
told
you
''
?
?
She
clearly
agreed
that
this
had
been
the
case
.
I
realized
,
now
,
that
she
had
been
showing
me
,
in
what
impressed
me
as
being
a
very
accurate
way
,
something
her
mother
had
once
said
to
her
;
;
it
was
as
if
she
was
showing
me
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
hated
that
woman
inside
her
.
What
had
been
an
unmanageably
powerful
introject
was
now
,
despite
its
continuing
charge
of
energy
disconcerting
to
me
,
sufficiently
within
control
of
her
ego
that
she
could
use
it
to
show
me
what
this
introjected
mother
was
like
.
Earlier
,
this
woman
had
been
so
filled
with
a
chaotic
variety
of
introjects
that
at
times
,
when
she
was
in
her
room
alone
,
it
would
sound
to
a
passerby
as
though
there
were
several
different
persons
in
the
room
,
as
she
would
vocalize
in
various
kinds
of
voice
.
A
somewhat
less
fragmented
hebephrenic
patient
of
mine
,
who
used
to
often
seclude
herself
in
her
room
,
often
sounded
through
the
closed
door
--
as
I
would
find
on
passing
by
,
between
our
sessions
--
for
all
the
world
like
two
persons
,
a
scolding
mother
and
a
defensive
child
.
Particularly
hard
for
the
therapist
to
grasp
are
those
instances
in
which
the
patient
is
manifesting
an
introject
traceable
to
something
in
the
therapist
,
some
aspect
of
the
therapist
of
which
the
latter
is
himself
only
poorly
aware
,
and
the
recognition
of
which
,
as
a
part
of
himself
,
he
finds
distinctly
unwelcome
.
I
have
found
,
time
and
again
,
that
some
bit
of
particularly
annoying
and
intractable
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
patient
rests
,
in
the
final
analysis
,
on
this
basis
;
;
and
only
when
I
can
acknowledge
this
,
to
myself
,
as
being
indeed
an
aspect
of
my
personality
,
does
it
cease
to
be
a
prominently
troublesome
aspect
of
the
patient's
behavior
.
For
example
,
one
hebephrenic
man
used
to
annoy
me
,
month
after
month
,
by
saying
,
whenever
I
got
up
to
leave
and
made
my
fairly
steoreotyped
comment
that
I
would
be
seeing
him
on
the
following
day
,
or
whenever
,
``
You're
welcome
''
,
in
a
notably
condescending
fashion
--
as
though
it
were
his
due
for
me
to
thank
him
for
the
privilege
of
spending
the
hour
with
him
,
and
he
were
thus
pointing
up
my
failure
to
utter
a
humbly
grateful
,
``
thank
you
''
to
him
at
the
end
of
each
session
.
Eventually
it
became
clear
to
me
,
partly
with
the
aid
of
another
schizophrenic
patient
who
could
point
out
my
condescension
to
me
somewhat
more
directly
,
that
this
man
,
with
his
condescending
,
``
You're
welcome
''
,
was
very
accurately
personifying
an
element
of
obnoxious
condescension
which
had
been
present
in
my
own
demeanor
,
over
these
months
,
on
each
of
these
occasions
when
I
had
bid
him
good-bye
with
the
consoling
note
,
each
time
,
that
the
healing
Christ
would
be
stooping
to
dispense
this
succor
to
the
poor
sufferer
again
on
the
morrow
.
Another
patient
,
a
paranoid
woman
,
for
many
months
infuriated
not
only
me
but
the
ward-personnel
and
her
fellow
patients
by
arrogantly
behaving
as
though
she
owned
the
whole
building
,
as
though
she
were
the
only
person
in
it
whose
needs
were
to
be
met
.
This
behavior
on
her
part
subsided
only
after
I
had
come
to
see
the
uncomfortably
close
similarity
between
,
on
the
one
hand
,
her
arranging
the
ventilation
of
the
common
living
room
to
her
own
liking
,
or
turning
the
television
off
or
on
without
regard
to
the
wishes
of
the
others
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
my
own
coming
stolidly
into
her
room
despite
her
persistent
and
vociferous
objections
,
bringing
my
big
easy
chair
with
me
,
usually
shutting
the
windows
of
her
room
which
she
preferred
to
keep
in
a
very
cold
state
,
and
plunking
myself
down
in
my
chair
--
in
short
,
behaving
as
if
I
owned
her
room
.

.
Condensation
.
Here
a
variety
of
meanings
and
emotions
are
concentrated
,
or
reduced
,
in
their
communicative
expression
,
to
some
comparatively
simple-seeming
verbal
or
nonverbal
statement
.
One
finds
,
for
example
,
that
a
terse
and
stereotyped
verbal
expression
,
seeming
at
first
to
be
a
mere
hollow
convention
,
reveals
itself
over
the
months
of
therapy
as
the
vehicle
for
expressing
the
most
varied
and
intense
feelings
,
and
the
most
unconventional
of
meanings
.
More
than
anything
,
it
is
the
therapist's
intuitive
sensing
of
these
latent
meanings
in
the
stereotype
which
helps
these
meanings
to
become
revealed
,
something
like
a
spread-out
deck
of
cards
,
on
sporadic
occasions
over
the
passage
of
the
patient's
and
his
months
of
work
together
.
One
cannot
assume
,
of
course
,
that
all
these
accumulated
meanings
were
inherent
in
the
stereotype
at
the
beginning
of
the
therapy
,
or
at
any
one
time
later
on
when
the
stereotype
was
uttered
;
;
probably
it
is
correct
to
think
of
it
as
a
matter
of
a
well-grooved
,
stereotyped
mode
of
expression
--
and
no
,
or
but
a
few
,
other
communicational
grooves
,
as
yet
--
being
there
,
available
for
the
patient's
use
,
as
newly-emerging
emotions
and
ideas
well
up
in
him
over
the
course
of
months
.
But
it
is
true
that
the
therapist
can
sense
,
when
he
hears
this
stereotype
,
that
there
are
at
this
moment
many
emotional
determinants
at
work
in
it
,
a
blurred
babel
of
indistinct
voices
which
have
yet
to
become
clearly
delineated
from
one
another
.
Sometimes
it
is
not
a
verbal
stereotype
--
a
``
How
are
you
now
''
?
?
Or
an
``
I
want
to
go
home
''
,
or
whatever
--
but
a
nonverbal
one
which
reveals
itself
,
gradually
,
as
the
condensed
expression
of
more
than
one
latent
meaning
.
A
hebephrenic
man
used
to
give
a
repetitious
wave
of
his
hand
a
number
of
times
during
his
largely-silent
hours
with
his
therapist
.
When
the
therapist
came
to
feel
on
sufficiently
sure
ground
with
him
to
ask
him
,
``
What
is
that
,
Bill
--
hello
or
farewell
''
?
?
,
the
patient
replied
,
``
Both
,
Dearie
--
two
in
one
''
.
Of
all
the
possible
forms
of
nonverbal
expression
,
that
which
seems
best
to
give
release
,
and
communicational
expression
,
to
complex
and
undifferentiated
feelings
is
laughter
.
It
is
no
coincidence
that
the
hebephrenic
patient
,
the
most
severely
dedifferentiated
of
all
schizophrenic
patients
,
shows
,
as
one
of
his
characteristic
symptoms
,
laughter
--
laughter
which
now
makes
one
feel
scorned
or
hated
,
which
now
makes
one
feel
like
weeping
,
or
which
now
gives
one
a
glimpse
of
the
bleak
and
empty
expanse
of
man's
despair
;
;
and
which
,
more
often
than
all
these
,
conveys
a
welter
of
feelings
which
could
in
no
way
be
conveyed
by
any
number
of
words
,
words
which
are
so
unlike
this
welter
in
being
formed
and
discrete
from
one
another
.
To
a
much
less
full
extent
,
the
hebephrenic
person's
belching
or
flatus
has
a
comparable
communicative
function
;
;
in
working
with
these
patients
the
therapist
eventually
gets
to
do
some
at
least
private
mulling
over
of
the
possible
meaning
of
a
belch
,
or
the
passage
of
flatus
,
not
only
because
he
is
reduced
to
this
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
analyze
,
but
also
because
he
learns
that
even
these
animal-like
sounds
constitute
forms
of
communication
in
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
quite
different
things
are
being
said
,
long
before
the
patient
can
become
sufficiently
aware
of
these
,
as
distinct
feelings
and
concepts
,
to
say
them
in
words
.
As
I
have
been
intimating
,
in
the
schizophrenic
--
and
perhaps
also
in
the
dreams
of
the
neurotic
;
;
this
is
a
question
which
I
have
no
wish
to
take
up
--
condensation
is
a
phenomenon
in
which
one
finds
not
a
condensed
expression
of
various
feelings
and
ideas
which
are
,
at
an
unconscious
level
,
well
sorted
out
,
but
rather
a
condensed
expression
of
feelings
and
ideas
which
,
even
in
the
unconscious
,
have
yet
to
become
well
differentiated
from
one
another
.
Freeman
,
Cameron
and
McGhie
,
in
their
description
of
the
disturbances
of
thinking
found
in
chronic
schizophrenic
patients
,
say
,
in
regard
to
condensation
,
that
``
the
lack
of
adequate
discrimination
between
the
self
and
the
environment
,
and
the
objects
contained
therein
in
itself
is
the
prototypical
condensation
''
.
In
my
experience
,
a
great
many
of
the
patient's
more
puzzling
verbal
communications
are
so
for
the
reason
that
concrete
meanings
have
not
become
differentiated
from
figurative
meanings
in
his
subjective
experience
.
Thus
he
may
be
referring
to
some
concrete
thing
,
or
incident
,
in
his
immediate
environment
by
some
symbolic-sounding
,
hyperbolic
reference
to
transcendental
events
on
the
global
scene
.
Recently
,
for
example
,
a
paranoid
woman's
large-scale
philosophizing
,
in
the
session
,
about
the
intrusive
curiosity
which
has
become
,
in
her
opinion
,
a
deplorable
characteristic
of
mid-twentieth-century
human
culture
,
developed
itself
,
before
the
end
of
the
session
,
into
a
suspicion
that
I
was
surreptitiously
peeking
at
her
partially
exposed
breast
,
as
indeed
I
was
.
Or
,
equally
often
,
a
concretistic-seeming
,
particularistic-seeming
statement
may
consist
,
with
its
mundane
exterior
,
in
a
form
of
poetry
--
may
be
full
of
meaning
and
emotion
when
interpreted
as
a
figurative
expression
:
a
metaphor
,
a
smile
,
an
allegory
,
or
some
other
symbolic
mode
of
speaking
.
Of
such
hidden
meanings
the
patient
himself
is
,
more
often
than
not
,
entirely
unaware
.
His
subjective
experience
may
be
a
remarkably
concretistic
one
.
One
hebephrenic
women
confided
to
me
,
``
I
live
in
a
world
of
words
''
,
as
if
,
to
her
,
words
were
fully
concrete
objects
;
;
Burnham
,
in
his
excellent
article
(
1955
)
concerning
schizophrenic
communication
,
includes
mention
of
similar
clinical
material
.
A
borderline
schizophrenic
young
man
told
me
that
to
him
the
various
theoretical
concepts
about
which
he
had
been
expounding
,
in
a
most
articulate
fashion
,
during
session
after
session
with
me
,
were
like
great
cubes
of
almost
tangibly
solid
matter
up
in
the
air
above
him
;
;
as
he
spoke
I
was
reminded
of
the
great
bales
of
cargo
which
are
swung
,
high
in
the
air
,
from
a
docked
steamship
.
The
many
linguistic
techniques
for
reducing
the
amount
of
dictionary
information
that
have
been
proposed
all
organize
the
dictionary's
contents
around
prefixes
,
stems
,
suffixes
,
etc.
.
A
significant
reduction
in
the
voume
of
store
information
is
thus
realized
,
especially
for
a
highly
inflected
language
such
as
Russian
.
For
English
the
reduction
in
size
is
less
striking
.
This
approach
requires
that
:
(
1
)
each
text
word
be
separated
into
smaller
elements
to
establish
a
correspondence
between
the
occurrence
and
dictionary
entries
,
and
(
2
)
the
information
retrieved
from
several
entries
in
the
dictionary
be
synthesized
into
a
description
of
the
particular
word
.
The
logical
scheme
used
to
accomplish
the
former
influences
the
placement
of
information
in
the
dictionary
file
.
Implementation
of
the
latter
requires
storage
of
information
needed
only
for
synthesis
.
We
suggest
the
application
of
certain
data-processing
techniques
as
a
solution
to
the
problem
.
But
first
,
we
must
define
two
terms
so
that
their
meaning
will
be
clearly
understood
:
form
--
any
unique
sequence
of
alphabetic
characters
that
can
appear
in
a
language
preceded
and
followed
by
a
space
;
;
occurrence
--
an
instance
of
a
form
in
text
.
We
propose
a
method
for
selecting
only
dictionary
information
required
by
the
text
being
translated
and
a
means
for
passing
the
information
directly
to
the
occurrences
in
text
.
We
accomplish
this
by
compiling
a
list
of
text
forms
as
text
is
read
by
the
computer
.
A
random-storage
scheme
,
based
on
the
spelling
of
forms
,
provides
an
economical
way
to
compile
this
text-form
list
.
Dictionary
forms
found
to
match
forms
in
the
text
list
are
marked
.
A
location
in
the
computer
store
is
also
named
for
each
marked
form
;
;
dictionary
information
about
the
form
stored
at
this
location
can
be
retrieved
directly
by
occurrences
of
the
form
in
text
.
Finally
,
information
is
retrieved
from
the
dictionary
as
required
by
stages
of
the
translation
process
--
the
grammatical
description
for
sentence-structure
determination
,
equivalent-choice
information
for
semantic
analysis
,
and
target-language
equivalents
for
output
construction
.
The
dictionary
is
a
form
dictionary
,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
complete
forms
are
used
as
the
basis
for
matching
text
occurrences
with
dictionary
entries
.
Also
,
the
dictionary
is
divided
into
at
least
two
parts
:
the
list
of
dictionary
forms
and
the
file
of
information
that
pertains
to
these
forms
.
A
more
detailed
description
of
dictionary
operations
--
text
lookup
and
dictionary
modification
--
gives
a
clearer
picture
.
Text
lookup
,
as
we
will
describe
it
,
consists
of
three
steps
.
The
first
is
compiling
a
list
of
text
forms
,
assigning
an
information
cell
to
each
,
and
replacing
text
occurrences
with
the
information
cell
assigned
to
the
form
of
each
occurrence
.
For
this
step
the
computer
memory
is
separated
into
three
regions
:
cells
in
the
W-region
are
used
for
storage
of
the
forms
in
the
text-form
list
;
;
cells
in
the
X-region
and
Y
region
are
reserved
as
information
cells
for
text
forms
.
When
an
occurrence
Af
is
isolated
during
text
reading
,
a
random
memory
address
Af
,
the
address
of
a
cell
in
the
X-region
,
is
computed
from
the
form
of
Af
.
Let
Af
denote
the
form
of
Af
.
If
cell
Af
has
not
previously
been
assigned
as
the
information
cell
of
a
form
in
the
text-form
list
,
it
is
now
assigned
as
the
information
cell
of
Af
.
The
form
itself
is
stored
in
the
next
available
cells
of
the
W-region
,
beginning
in
cell
Af
.
The
address
Af
and
the
number
of
cells
required
to
store
the
form
are
written
in
Af
;
;
the
information
cell
Af
is
saved
to
represent
the
text
occurrence
.
Text
reading
continues
with
the
next
occurrence
.
Let
us
assume
that
Af
is
identical
to
the
form
of
an
occurrence
Af
which
preceded
Af
in
the
text
.
When
this
situation
exists
,
the
address
Af
will
equal
Af
which
was
produced
from
Af
.
If
Af
was
assigned
as
the
information
cell
for
Af
,
the
routine
can
detect
that
Af
is
identical
to
Af
by
comparing
Af
with
the
form
stored
at
location
Af
.
The
address
Af
is
stored
in
the
cell
Af
.
When
,
as
in
this
case
,
the
two
forms
match
,
the
address
Af
is
saved
to
represent
the
occurrence
Af
.
Text
reading
continues
with
the
next
occurrence
.
A
third
situation
is
possible
.
The
formula
for
computing
random
addresses
from
the
form
of
each
occurrence
will
not
give
a
distinct
address
for
each
distinct
form
.
Thus
,
when
more
than
one
distinct
form
leads
to
a
particular
cell
in
the
X-region
,
a
chain
of
information
cells
must
be
created
to
accommodate
the
forms
,
one
cell
in
the
chain
for
each
form
.
If
Af
leads
to
an
address
Af
that
is
equal
to
the
address
computed
from
Af
,
even
though
Af
does
not
match
Af
,
the
chain
of
information
cells
is
extended
from
Af
by
storing
the
address
of
the
next
available
cell
in
the
Y-region
,
Af
,
in
Af
.
The
cell
Af
becomes
the
second
information
cell
in
the
chain
and
is
assigned
as
the
information
cell
of
Af
.
A
third
cell
can
be
added
by
storing
the
address
of
another
Y-cell
in
Af
;
;
similarly
,
as
many
cells
are
added
as
are
required
.
Each
information
cell
in
the
chain
contains
the
address
of
the
Y-cell
where
the
form
to
which
it
is
assigned
is
stored
.
Each
cell
except
the
last
in
the
chain
also
contains
the
address
of
the
Y-cell
that
is
the
next
element
of
the
chain
;
;
the
absence
of
such
a
link
in
the
last
cell
indicates
the
end
of
the
chain
.
Hence
,
when
the
address
Af
is
computed
from
Af
,
the
cell
Af
and
all
Y-cells
in
its
chain
must
be
inspected
to
determine
whether
Af
is
already
in
the
form
list
or
whether
it
should
be
added
to
the
form
list
and
the
chain
.
When
the
information
cell
for
Af
has
been
determined
,
it
is
saved
as
a
representation
of
Af
.
Text
reading
continues
with
the
next
occurrence
.
Text
reading
is
terminated
when
a
pre-determined
number
of
forms
have
been
stored
in
the
text-form
list
.
This
initiates
the
second
step
of
glossary
lookup
--
connecting
the
information
cell
of
forms
in
the
text-form
list
to
dictionary
forms
.
Each
form
represented
by
the
dictionary
is
looked
up
in
the
text-form
list
.
Each
time
a
dictionary
form
matches
a
text
form
,
the
information
cell
of
the
matching
text
form
is
saved
.
The
number
of
dictionary
forms
skipped
since
the
last
one
matched
is
also
saved
.
These
two
pieces
of
information
for
each
dictionary
form
that
is
matched
by
a
text
form
constitute
the
table
of
dictionary
usage
.
If
each
text
form
is
marked
when
matched
with
a
dictionary
form
,
the
text
forms
not
contained
in
the
dictionary
can
be
identified
when
all
dictionary
forms
have
been
read
.
The
appropriate
action
for
handling
these
forms
can
be
taken
at
that
time
.
Each
dictionary
form
is
looked
up
in
the
text-form
list
by
the
same
method
used
to
look
up
a
new
text
occurrence
in
the
form
list
during
text
reading
.
A
random
address
Af
that
lies
within
the
X-region
of
memory
mentioned
earlier
is
computed
from
the
i-th
dictionary
form
.
If
cell
Af
is
an
information
cell
,
it
and
any
information
cells
in
the
Y-region
that
have
been
linked
to
Af
each
contain
an
address
in
the
W-region
where
a
potentially
matching
form
is
stored
.
The
dictionary
form
is
compared
with
each
of
these
text
forms
.
When
a
match
is
found
,
an
entry
is
made
in
the
table
of
dictionary
usage
.
If
cell
Af
is
not
an
information
cell
we
conclude
that
the
i-th
dictionary
form
is
not
in
the
text
list
.
These
two
steps
essentially
complete
the
lookup
operation
.
The
final
step
merely
uses
the
table
of
dictionary
usage
to
select
the
dictionary
information
that
pertains
to
each
form
matched
in
the
text-form
list
,
and
uses
the
list
of
information
cells
recorded
in
text
order
to
attach
the
appropriate
information
to
each
occurrence
in
text
.
The
list
of
text
forms
in
the
W-region
of
memory
and
the
contents
of
the
information
cells
in
the
X
and
Y-regions
are
no
longer
required
.
Only
the
assignment
of
the
information
cells
is
important
.
The
first
stage
of
translation
after
glossary
lookup
is
structural
analysis
of
the
input
text
.
The
grammatical
description
of
each
occurrence
in
the
text
must
be
retrieved
from
the
dictionary
to
permit
such
an
analysis
.
A
description
of
this
process
will
serve
to
illustrate
how
any
type
of
information
can
be
retrieved
from
the
dictionary
and
attached
to
each
text
occurrence
.
The
grammatical
descriptions
of
all
forms
in
the
dictionary
are
recorded
in
a
separate
part
of
the
dictionary
file
.
The
order
is
identical
to
the
ordering
of
the
forms
they
describe
.
When
entries
are
being
retrieved
from
this
file
,
the
table
of
dictionary
usage
indicates
which
entries
to
skip
and
which
entries
to
store
in
the
computer
.
This
selection-rejection
process
takes
place
as
the
file
is
read
.
Each
entry
that
is
selected
for
storage
is
written
into
the
next
available
cells
of
the
Aj
.
The
address
of
the
first
cell
and
the
number
of
cells
used
is
written
in
the
information
cell
for
the
form
.
(
The
address
of
the
information
cell
is
also
supplied
by
the
table
of
dictionary
usage
.
)
When
the
complete
file
has
been
read
,
the
grammatical
descriptions
for
all
text
forms
found
in
the
dictionary
have
been
stored
in
the
W-region
;
;
the
information
cell
assigned
to
each
text
form
contains
the
address
of
the
grammatical
description
of
the
form
it
represents
.
Hence
,
the
description
of
each
text
occurrence
can
be
retrieved
by
reading
the
list
of
text-ordered
information-cell
addresses
and
outputting
the
description
indicated
by
the
information
cell
for
each
occurrence
.
The
only
requirements
on
dictionary
information
made
by
the
text-lookup
operation
are
that
each
form
represented
by
the
dictionary
be
available
for
lookup
in
the
text-form
list
and
that
information
for
each
form
be
available
in
a
sequence
identical
with
the
sequence
of
the
forms
.
This
leaves
the
ordering
of
entries
variable
.
(
Here
an
entry
is
a
form
plus
the
information
that
pertains
to
it
.
)
Two
very
useful
ways
for
modifying
a
form-dictionary
are
the
addition
to
the
dictionary
of
complete
paradigms
rather
than
single
forms
and
the
application
of
a
single
change
to
more
than
one
dictionary
form
.
The
former
is
intended
to
decrease
the
amount
of
work
necessary
to
extend
dictionary
coverage
.
The
latter
is
useful
for
modifying
information
about
some
or
all
forms
of
a
word
,
hence
reducing
the
work
required
to
improve
dictionary
contents
.
Applying
the
techniques
developed
at
Harvard
for
generating
a
paradigm
from
a
representative
form
and
its
classification
,
we
can
add
all
forms
of
a
word
to
the
dictionary
at
once
.
An
extension
of
the
principle
would
permit
entering
a
grammatical
description
of
each
form
.
Equivalents
could
be
assigned
to
the
paradigm
either
at
the
time
it
is
added
to
the
dictionary
or
after
the
word
has
been
studied
in
context
.
Thus
,
one
can
think
of
a
dictionary
entry
as
a
word
rather
than
a
form
.
If
all
forms
of
a
paradigm
are
grouped
together
within
the
dictionary
,
a
considerable
reduction
in
the
amount
of
information
required
is
possible
.
For
example
,
the
inflected
forms
of
a
word
can
be
represented
,
insofar
as
regular
inflection
allows
,
by
a
stem
and
a
set
of
endings
to
be
attached
.
(
Indeed
,
the
set
of
endings
can
be
replaced
by
the
name
of
a
set
of
endings
.
)
The
full
forms
can
be
derived
from
such
information
just
prior
to
the
lookup
of
the
form
in
the
text-form
list
.
Similarly
,
if
the
equivalents
for
the
forms
of
a
word
do
not
vary
,
the
equivalents
need
be
entered
only
once
with
an
indication
that
they
apply
to
each
form
.
The
dictionary
system
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
such
summarization
or
designed
around
it
.
When
irregularity
and
variation
prevent
summarizing
,
information
is
written
in
complete
detail
.
Entries
are
summarized
only
when
by
doing
so
the
amount
of
information
retained
in
the
dictionary
is
reduced
and
the
time
required
for
dictionary
operations
is
decreased
.
In
sentences
,
patterns
of
stress
are
determined
by
complex
combinations
of
influences
that
can
only
be
suggested
here
.
The
tendency
is
toward
putting
dominant
stress
at
the
end
.
There
is
a
parallel
to
this
tendency
in
the
assignment
of
time
in
long-known
hymn
tunes
.
Thus
the
first
lines
of
one
of
Charles
Wesley's
hymns
are
as
follows
.
``
A
charge
to
keep
I
have
,
A
God
to
glorify
''
.
In
the
tune
to
which
this
hymn
is
most
often
sung
,
``
Boylston
''
,
the
syllables
have
and
fy
,
ending
their
lines
,
have
twice
the
time
any
other
syllables
have
.
Dominant
stress
is
of
course
more
than
extended
duration
,
and
normally
centers
on
syllables
that
would
have
primary
stress
or
phrase
stress
if
the
words
or
longer
units
they
are
parts
of
were
spoken
alone
:
a
dominant
stress
given
to
glorify
would
normally
center
on
its
first
syllable
rather
than
its
last
.
But
the
parallel
is
significant
.
When
the
answer
to
what's
wrong
now
?
?
Is
Bill's
broken
a
chair
,
dominant
stress
will
usually
be
on
the
complement
a
chair
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
syntactic
analysis
the
head
word
in
the
statement
is
the
predicator
has
broken
,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
meaning
it
would
seem
that
the
trouble
centers
in
the
breaking
;
;
but
dominant
stress
will
be
assigned
to
broken
only
in
rather
exceptional
versions
of
the
sentence
.
In
I
know
one
thing
dominant
stress
will
usually
be
on
the
complement
one
thing
;
;
in
one
thing
I
know
it
will
usually
be
on
the
predicator
know
.
In
small-town
people
are
very
friendly
dominant
stress
will
generally
be
on
the
complement
very
friendly
;
;
in
the
double
sentence
the
smaller
the
town
,
the
friendlier
the
people
it
will
generally
be
on
the
subjects
the
town
and
the
people
.
In
what's
a
linguist
?
?
dominant
stress
will
generally
be
on
the
subject
a
linguist
;
;
in
who's
a
linguist
?
it
will
generally
be
on
the
complement
a
linguist
.
Dominant
stress
is
on
her
luggage
both
in
that's
her
luggage
,
where
her
luggage
is
the
complement
,
and
in
there's
her
luggage
,
where
it
is
the
subject
.
Adverbial
second
complements
,
however
,
are
likely
not
to
have
dominant
stress
when
they
terminate
sentences
.
If
the
answer
to
what
was
that
noise
?
?
Is
George
put
the
cat
out
,
dominant
stress
will
ordinarily
be
on
the
first
complement
,
the
cat
,
not
the
second
complement
out
.
Final
adjuncts
may
or
may
not
have
dominant
stress
.
If
the
answer
to
what
was
that
noise
?
?
Is
George
reads
the
news
emotionally
,
dominant
stress
may
or
may
not
be
on
the
adjunct
emotionally
.
When
prepositional
complements
are
divided
as
in
what
are
you
looking
for
?
?
They
are
likely
to
lose
dominant
stress
.
Context
is
of
extreme
importance
.
What
is
new
in
the
context
is
likely
to
be
made
more
prominent
than
what
is
not
.
Thus
in
a
context
in
which
there
has
been
discussion
of
snow
but
mention
of
local
conditions
is
new
,
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
here
in
it
rarely
snows
here
,
but
in
a
context
in
which
there
has
been
discussion
of
local
weather
but
no
mention
of
snow
,
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
snows
.
The
personal
pronouns
and
substitute
one
are
normally
unstressed
because
they
refer
to
what
is
prominent
in
the
immediate
context
.
In
I'll
go
with
George
dominant
stress
is
probably
on
George
;
;
but
if
George
has
just
been
mentioned
prominently
(
and
the
trip
to
be
made
has
been
under
discussion
)
,
what
is
said
is
probably
I'll
go
with
him
,
and
dominant
stress
is
probably
on
the
preposition
with
.
When
a
gesture
accompanies
who's
he
?
?
the
personal
pronoun
has
dominant
stress
because
``
he
''
has
not
been
mentioned
previously
.
If
both
George
and
a
piece
of
information
George
does
not
have
are
prominent
in
the
context
,
but
the
idea
of
telling
George
is
new
,
then
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
tell
in
why
not
tell
George
?
?
But
when
what
is
new
in
a
particular
context
is
also
fairly
obvious
,
there
is
normally
only
light
stress
or
no
stress
at
all
.
Thus
the
unstressed
it
of
it
rarely
snows
here
gets
its
significance
from
its
use
with
snows
:
nothing
can
snow
snow
but
``
it
''
.
In
there
aren't
many
young
people
in
the
neighborhood
the
modifier
young
takes
dominant
stress
away
from
its
head
people
:
the
fact
that
the
young
creatures
of
interest
are
people
seems
rather
obvious
.
If
women
replaced
people
,
it
would
normally
have
dominant
stress
.
In
I
have
things
to
do
the
word
things
makes
little
real
contribution
to
meaning
and
has
weaker
stress
than
do
.
If
work
is
substituted
for
things
(
with
more
exact
contribution
to
meaning
)
,
it
will
have
dominant
stress
.
In
I
know
one
thing
dominant
stress
is
likely
to
go
to
one
rather
than
to
semantically
pale
thing
.
In
I
knew
you
when
you
were
a
child
,
and
you
were
pretty
then
dominant
stress
on
then
implies
that
the
young
woman
spoken
to
is
still
pretty
.
Dominant
stress
on
pretty
would
be
almost
insulting
here
.
In
the
written
language
then
can
be
underlined
or
italicized
to
guide
the
reader
here
,
but
much
of
the
time
the
written
language
simply
depends
on
the
reader's
alertness
,
and
a
careless
reader
will
have
to
back
up
and
reread
.
Often
,
dominant
stress
simply
indicates
a
centering
of
attention
or
emotion
.
Thus
in
it's
incredible
what
that
boy
can
eat
dominant
stress
is
likely
to
be
on
incredible
,
and
eat
will
have
strong
stress
also
.
In
she
has
it
in
for
George
dominant
stress
will
ordinarily
be
on
in
,
where
the
notion
of
stored-up
antipathy
seems
to
center
.
In
we're
painting
at
our
garage
strong
stress
on
at
indicates
that
the
job
being
done
is
not
real
painting
but
simply
an
effort
at
painting
.
Where
there
is
comparison
or
contrast
,
dominant
stresses
normally
operate
to
center
attention
.
Thus
in
his
friends
are
stranger
than
his
sisters'
strong
stresses
are
normal
for
his
and
sisters'
,
but
in
his
friends
are
stranger
than
his
sisters
strong
stresses
are
normal
for
friends
and
sisters
.
In
he's
hurting
himself
more
than
he's
hurting
you
both
himself
and
you
have
stronger
stress
than
they
would
ordinarily
have
if
there
were
no
contrast
.
In
is
she
Chinese
or
Japanese
?
?
The
desire
to
contrast
the
first
parts
of
words
which
are
alike
in
their
last
components
produces
an
exceptional
disregard
of
the
normal
patterns
of
stress
of
Chinese
and
Japanese
.
Sometimes
strong
stress
serves
to
focus
an
important
secondary
relationship
.
Thus
in
Mary
wrote
an
account
of
the
trip
first
strong
stress
on
Mary
marks
Mary
as
the
first
in
a
series
of
people
who
wrote
accounts
of
the
trip
,
strong
stress
on
wrote
marks
the
writing
as
the
first
of
a
series
of
actions
of
Mary's
concerned
with
an
account
of
her
trip
(
about
which
she
may
later
have
made
speeches
,
for
example
)
,
and
strong
stress
on
trip
makes
the
trip
the
first
of
a
series
of
subjects
about
which
Mary
wrote
accounts
.
In
hunger
stimulates
man
too
the
situation
is
very
similar
.
Strong
stress
on
hunger
treats
hunger
as
an
additional
stimulus
,
strong
stress
on
stimulates
treats
stimulation
as
an
additional
effect
of
hunger
,
strong
stress
on
man
treats
man
as
an
additional
creature
who
responds
to
the
stimulation
of
hunger
.
Here
again
,
in
the
written
language
it
is
possible
to
help
the
reader
get
his
stresses
right
by
using
underlining
or
italics
,
but
much
of
the
time
there
is
simply
reliance
on
his
understanding
in
the
light
of
context
.
When
a
word
represents
a
larger
construction
of
which
it
is
the
only
expressed
part
,
it
normally
has
more
stress
than
it
would
have
in
fully
expressed
construction
.
Thus
when
yes
,
I
have
is
the
response
to
have
you
finished
reading
the
paper
?
?
The
stress
on
have
,
which
here
represents
have
finished
reading
the
paper
,
is
quite
strong
.
In
Mack's
the
leader
at
camp
,
but
Jack
is
here
the
is
of
the
second
main
declarative
represents
is
the
leader
and
therefore
has
stress
.
Mack's
the
leader
at
camp
,
but
Jack's
here
,
with
this
is
deprived
of
stress
,
makes
here
the
complement
in
the
clause
.
In
of
all
the
suggestions
that
were
made
,
his
was
the
silliest
the
possessive
his
represents
his
suggestion
and
is
stressed
.
When
go
represents
itself
and
a
complement
(
being
equivalent
,
say
,
to
go
to
Martinique
)
in
which
boat
did
Jack
go
on
?
?
It
has
strong
stress
;
;
when
it
represents
only
itself
and
on
which
is
its
complement
(
so
that
go
on
is
semantically
equivalent
to
board
)
,
on
has
stronger
stress
than
go
does
.
Omission
of
a
subordinator
pronoun
,
however
,
does
not
result
in
an
increase
in
stress
on
a
prepositional
adverb
for
which
the
subordinator
pronoun
would
be
object
.
Thus
to
has
light
stress
both
in
that
was
the
conclusion
that
I
came
to
and
in
that
was
the
conclusion
I
came
to
.
But
when
to
represents
to
consciousness
in
that
was
the
moment
that
I
came
to
,
and
similarly
in
that
was
the
moment
I
came
to
,
there
is
much
stronger
stress
on
to
.
In
I
wanted
to
tell
him
,
but
I
was
afraid
to
the
final
to
is
lightly
stressed
because
it
represents
to
tell
him
.
In
to
tell
him
,
of
course
,
to
is
normally
unstressed
.
When
I
have
instructions
to
leave
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
I
have
instructions
that
I
am
to
leave
this
place
,
dominant
stress
is
ordinarily
on
leave
.
When
the
same
sequence
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
I
have
instructions
which
I
am
to
leave
,
dominant
stress
is
ordinarily
on
instructions
.
It
is
clear
that
patterns
of
stress
sometimes
show
construction
unambiguously
in
the
spoken
language
where
without
the
help
of
context
it
would
be
ambiguous
in
the
written
.
Other
examples
follow
.
``
I'll
come
by
Tuesday
.
I
can't
be
happy
long
without
drinking
water
''
.
In
the
first
of
these
sentences
if
by
is
the
complement
of
come
and
Tuesday
is
an
adjunct
of
time
equivalent
to
on
Tuesday
,
there
will
be
strong
stress
on
by
in
the
spoken
language
;
;
but
if
a
complement
for
come
is
implied
and
by
Tuesday
is
a
prepositional
unit
used
as
an
adjunct
,
by
will
be
unstressed
or
lightly
stressed
at
most
.
In
the
second
sentence
if
drinking
water
is
a
gerundial
clause
and
without
drinking
water
is
roughly
equivalent
in
meaning
to
unless
I
drink
water
,
there
will
be
stronger
stress
on
water
than
on
drinking
;
;
but
if
drinking
is
a
gerundial
noun
modifying
water
and
without
drinking
water
is
equivalent
to
without
water
for
drinking
,
there
will
be
stronger
stress
on
drinking
than
on
water
.
But
the
use
of
stress
in
comparison
and
contrast
,
for
example
,
can
undermine
distinctions
such
as
these
.
And
patterns
of
stress
are
not
always
unambiguous
by
any
means
.
In
the
Steiners
have
busy
lives
without
visiting
relatives
only
context
can
indicate
whether
visiting
relatives
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
paying
visits
to
relatives
or
to
relatives
who
are
visiting
them
,
and
in
I
looked
up
the
number
and
I
looked
up
the
chimney
only
the
meanings
of
number
and
chimney
make
it
clear
that
up
is
syntactically
a
second
complement
in
the
first
sentence
and
a
preposition
followed
by
its
object
in
the
second
.
Syllabification
.
--
Syllables
are
linguistic
units
centering
in
peaks
which
are
usually
vocalic
but
,
as
has
been
noted
,
are
consonantal
under
certain
circumstances
,
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
combined
with
preceding
and/or
following
consonants
or
combinations
of
consonants
.
Syllables
are
genuine
units
,
but
division
of
words
and
sentences
into
them
presents
great
difficulties
.
Sometimes
even
the
number
of
syllables
is
not
clear
.
Doubt
on
this
point
is
strongest
before
/l/
and
AAb/
or
/r/
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
word
formation
real
might
be
expected
to
have
two
syllables
.
Historically
re
is
the
formative
that
is
employed
also
in
republic
,
and
al
is
the
common
suffix
.
When
ity
is
added
,
real
clearly
has
two
syllables
.
But
there
is
every
reason
to
regard
deal
as
a
monosyllable
,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
/l/
commonly
has
the
quality
of
AAb/
when
it
follows
vowel
sounds
,
deal
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
satisfactory
rhyme
with
deal
.
It
is
obvious
enough
that
linguists
in
general
have
been
less
successful
in
coping
with
tone
systems
than
with
consonants
or
vowels
.
No
single
explanation
is
adequate
to
account
for
this
.
Improvement
,
however
,
is
urgent
,
and
at
least
three
things
will
be
needed
.
The
first
is
a
wide-ranging
sample
of
successful
tonal
analyses
.
Even
beginning
students
in
linguistics
are
made
familiar
with
an
appreciable
variety
of
consonant
systems
,
both
in
their
general
outlines
and
in
many
specific
details
.
An
advanced
student
has
read
a
considerable
number
of
descriptions
of
consonantal
systems
,
including
some
of
the
more
unusual
types
.
By
contrast
,
even
experienced
linguists
commonly
know
no
more
of
the
range
of
possibilities
in
tone
systems
than
the
over-simple
distinction
between
register
and
contour
languages
.
This
limited
familiarity
with
the
possible
phenomena
has
severely
hampered
work
with
tone
.
Tone
analysis
will
continue
to
be
difficult
and
unsatisfactory
until
a
more
representative
selection
of
systems
is
familar
to
every
practicing
field
linguist
.
Papers
like
these
four
,
if
widely
read
,
will
contribute
importantly
to
improvement
of
our
analytic
work
.
The
second
need
is
better
field
techniques
.
The
great
majority
of
present-day
linguists
fall
into
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
overlapping
types
:
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
cannot
be
analysed
,
those
who
are
personally
scared
of
tone
and
tone
languages
generally
,
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
is
merely
an
unnecessary
marginal
feature
in
those
languages
where
it
occurs
,
those
who
have
no
idea
how
to
proceed
with
tone
analysis
,
those
who
take
a
simplistic
view
of
the
whole
matter
.
The
result
has
been
neglect
,
fumbling
efforts
,
or
superficial
treatment
.
As
these
maladies
overlap
,
so
must
the
cure
.
Analyses
such
as
these
four
will
simultaneously
combat
the
assumptions
that
tone
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
simple
.
They
will
give
suggestions
that
can
be
worked
up
into
field
procedures
.
Good
field
techniques
will
not
only
equip
linguists
for
better
work
,
but
also
help
them
overcome
negative
attitudes
.
Actually
,
none
of
these
papers
says
much
directly
about
field
techniques
.
But
it
is
worth
pondering
that
very
little
has
been
published
on
any
phase
of
field
techniques
in
linguistics
.
These
things
have
been
disseminated
by
other
means
,
but
always
in
the
wake
of
extensive
publication
of
analytic
results
.
The
third
need
is
for
better
theory
.
We
should
expect
that
general
phonologic
theory
should
be
as
adequate
for
tone
as
for
consonants
and
vowels
,
but
it
has
not
been
.
This
can
only
be
for
one
of
two
reasons
:
either
the
two
are
quite
different
and
will
require
totally
different
theory
(
and
hence
techniques
)
,
or
our
existing
theories
are
insufficiently
general
.
If
,
as
I
suspect
,
the
problem
is
largely
of
the
second
sort
,
then
development
of
a
theory
better
able
to
handle
tone
will
result
automatically
in
better
theory
for
all
phonologic
subsystems
.
One
issue
that
must
be
faced
is
the
relative
difficulty
of
analysis
of
different
phonologic
subsystems
.
Since
tone
systems
typically
comprise
fewer
units
than
either
consonant
or
vowel
systems
,
we
might
expect
that
they
would
be
the
easiest
part
of
a
phonologic
analysis
.
Actual
practice
does
not
often
work
out
this
way
.
Tone
systems
are
certainly
more
complex
than
the
number
of
units
would
suggest
,
and
often
analytically
more
difficult
than
much
larger
consonantal
systems
.
Welmers
has
suggested
one
explanation
.
Tone
languages
use
for
linguistic
contrasts
speech
parameters
which
also
function
heavily
in
nonlinguistic
use
.
This
may
both
divert
the
attention
of
the
uninitiate
and
cause
confusion
for
the
more
knowledgeable
.
The
problem
is
to
disentangle
the
linguistic
features
of
pitch
from
the
co-occurring
nonlinguistic
features
.
Of
course
,
something
of
the
same
sort
occurs
with
other
sectors
of
the
phonology
:
consonantal
articulations
have
both
a
linguistic
and
an
individual
component
.
But
in
general
the
individual
variation
is
a
small
thing
added
onto
basic
linguistic
features
of
greater
magnitude
.
With
tone
,
individual
differences
may
be
greater
than
the
linguistic
contrasts
which
are
superimposed
on
them
.
Pitch
differences
from
one
speaker
to
another
,
or
from
one
emotional
state
to
another
,
may
far
exceed
the
small
differences
between
tones
.
However
,
any
such
suggestion
accounts
for
only
some
of
the
difficulties
in
hearing
tone
,
or
in
developing
a
realistic
attitude
about
tone
,
but
not
for
the
analytic
difficulties
that
occur
even
when
tone
is
meticulously
recorded
.
A
second
explanation
is
suggested
by
the
material
described
in
Rowlands'
paper
.
Tone
and
intonation
often
become
seriously
intermeshed
.
Neither
can
be
adequately
systematized
until
we
are
able
to
separate
the
two
and
assign
the
observed
phenomena
individually
to
one
or
the
other
.
Other
pairs
of
phonologic
subsystems
also
interact
or
overlap
in
this
way
;
;
for
example
,
duration
sometimes
figures
in
both
the
vowel
system
and
the
intonation
.
Some
phonetic
features
,
for
example
glottal
catch
or
murmur
,
are
sometimes
to
be
assigned
to
segmental
phonemics
and
sometimes
to
accentual
systems
.
But
no
other
two
phonologic
systems
are
as
difficult
to
disentangle
as
are
tone
and
intonation
in
some
languages
.
This
explanation
of
tone
difficulties
,
however
,
does
not
apply
in
all
languages
.
In
some
(
the
Ewe
type
mentioned
above
)
interaction
of
tone
and
intonation
is
restricted
to
the
ends
of
intonation
spans
.
In
many
of
the
syllables
,
intonation
can
be
safely
ignored
,
and
much
of
the
tonal
analysis
can
be
done
without
any
study
of
intonation
.
Still
,
even
in
such
languages
tone
analysis
has
not
been
as
simple
as
one
might
expect
.
A
third
explanation
is
suggested
by
Richardson's
analysis
of
Sukuma
tone
.
There
we
see
a
basically
simple
phonemic
system
enmeshed
in
a
very
complex
and
puzzling
morphophonemic
system
.
While
the
phonemes
can
be
very
easily
stated
,
no
one
is
likely
to
be
satisfied
with
the
statement
until
phonemic
occurrences
can
be
related
in
some
way
to
morphemic
units
,
i.e.
until
the
morphophonemics
is
worked
out
,
or
at
least
far
enough
that
it
seems
reasonable
to
expect
success
.
In
the
``
typical
tone
language
''
,
tonal
morphophonemics
is
of
the
same
order
of
complexity
as
consonantal
morphophonemics
.
The
phonemic
systems
which
must
support
these
morphophonemic
systems
,
however
,
are
very
different
.
The
inventory
of
tones
is
much
smaller
,
and
commonly
the
contrasts
range
along
one
single
dimension
,
pitch
level
.
Consonantal
systems
are
not
merely
larger
,
they
are
multidimensional
.
Morphophonemic
rules
may
be
thought
of
as
joining
certain
points
in
the
system
.
The
possibilities
in
the
consonantal
system
are
very
numerous
,
and
only
a
small
portion
of
them
are
actually
used
.
Phonemes
connected
by
a
morphophonemic
rule
commonly
show
a
good
bit
of
phonetic
similarity
,
possible
because
of
the
several
dimensions
of
contrast
in
the
system
.
Tonal
morphophonemics
,
in
a
common
case
,
can
do
nothing
but
either
raise
or
lower
the
tone
.
The
possibilities
are
few
,
and
the
total
number
of
rules
may
be
considerably
greater
.
Often
,
therefore
,
there
are
a
number
of
rules
having
the
same
effect
,
and
commonly
other
sets
of
rules
as
well
,
having
the
opposite
effect
.
Tonal
morphophonemics
is
much
more
confusing
to
the
beginning
analyst
than
consonantal
morphophonemics
,
even
when
the
total
number
of
rules
is
no
greater
.
The
difficulty
of
analysis
of
any
subsystem
in
the
phonology
is
an
inverse
function
of
the
size
--
smaller
systems
are
more
troublesome
--
for
any
given
degree
of
morphophonemic
complexity
.
This
hypothesis
will
account
for
a
large
part
of
the
difficulties
of
tonal
analysis
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
vowel
systems
are
often
more
puzzling
than
consonantal
systems
.
The
statement
of
the
system
is
a
different
matter
.
Smaller
systems
can
of
course
be
stated
much
more
succinctly
.
A
phonemic
system
can
be
stated
without
reference
to
morphophonemics
,
but
it
cannot
always
be
found
without
morphophonemics
.
And
the
more
complex
the
morphophonemic
system
is
in
relation
to
the
phonemic
base
,
the
less
easily
a
phonemic
system
will
be
analysed
without
close
attention
to
the
morphophonemics
--
at
least
,
the
less
satisfying
will
a
phonemic
statement
be
if
it
cannot
be
related
through
morphophonemic
rules
to
grammatically
meaningful
structures
.
The
design
of
orthographies
has
received
much
less
attention
from
linguists
than
the
problem
deserves
.
There
has
been
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
many
American
linguists
to
assume
that
a
phonemic
transcription
will
automatically
be
the
best
possible
orthography
and
that
the
only
real
problem
will
then
be
the
social
one
of
securing
acceptance
.
This
seems
naive
.
Most
others
have
been
content
to
give
only
the
most
general
attention
to
the
broadest
and
most
obvious
features
of
the
phonology
when
designing
orthographies
.
Apparently
the
feeling
is
that
anything
more
would
be
involvement
in
technical
abstrusenesses
of
possible
pedantic
interest
but
of
no
visible
significance
in
practical
affairs
.
The
result
of
this
attitude
has
been
the
domination
of
many
orthography
conferences
by
such
considerations
as
typographic
'
esthetics
'
,
which
usually
turns
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
certain
prejudices
carried
over
from
European
languages
.
Many
of
the
suggested
systems
seem
to
have
only
the
most
tenuous
relationship
to
the
language
structures
that
they
purport
to
represent
.
Linguists
have
not
always
been
more
enlightened
than
``
practical
people
''
and
sometimes
have
insisted
on
incredibly
trivial
points
while
neglecting
things
of
much
greater
significance
.
As
a
result
,
many
people
have
been
confirmed
in
their
conviction
that
orthography
design
is
not
an
activity
to
which
experts
can
contribute
anything
but
confusion
.
A.
E.
Sharp
,
in
Vowel-Length
And
Syllabicity
In
Kikuyu
,
examines
one
set
of
related
orthographic
questions
and
its
phonologic
background
in
detail
.
His
objective
is
merely
to
determine
``
what
distinctions
of
length
and
syllabicity
it
may
be
desirable
to
make
explicit
in
a
Kikuyu
orthography
''
(
59
)
.
To
do
so
,
he
finds
it
necessary
to
examine
the
relevant
parts
of
the
phonology
thoroughly
and
in
detail
.
In
the
process
,
he
develops
some
very
significant
observations
about
problems
of
a
sort
that
are
often
difficult
.
A
few
of
his
examples
are
of
very
great
interest
,
and
the
whole
discussion
of
some
importance
for
theory
.
His
orthographic
recommendations
are
no
simplistic
acceptance
of
phonemics
on
the
one
hand
or
of
superficiality
on
the
other
.
Rather
he
weighs
each
phonologic
fact
in
the
light
of
its
orthographic
usefulness
.
He
concludes
that
some
changes
can
be
made
in
the
current
orthography
which
will
appreciably
improve
its
usefulness
,
but
hesitates
to
suggest
precise
graphic
devices
to
effect
these
changes
.
I
hope
his
suggestions
are
given
the
consideration
they
deserve
in
Kikuyu
circles
.
This
,
however
,
will
not
exhaust
their
practical
usefulness
,
as
they
rather
clearly
indicate
what
thorough
phonologic
investigation
can
contribute
to
orthography
design
.
We
need
many
more
studies
of
this
sort
if
the
design
of
written
languages
is
to
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
.
One
other
paper
deals
with
a
phonologic
problem
:
Vowel
Harmony
In
Igbo
,
by
J.
Carnochan
.
This
restates
the
already
widely
known
facts
in
terms
of
prosodies
.
As
a
restatement
it
makes
only
a
small
contribution
to
knowledge
of
Igbo
.
But
it
would
seem
more
intended
as
a
tract
advocating
the
prosodic
theory
than
a
paper
directed
to
the
specific
problems
of
Igbo
phonology
.
The
paper
has
a
certain
value
as
a
comparatively
easy
introduction
to
this
approach
,
particularly
since
it
treats
a
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
phenomenon
where
it
is
possible
to
compare
it
with
a
more
traditional
(
though
not
structural
)
statement
.
It
does
show
one
feature
of
the
system
that
has
not
been
previously
described
.
But
it
does
not
,
as
it
claims
,
demonstrate
that
this
could
not
be
treated
by
traditional
methods
.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
rather
easily
can
.
Five
of
the
papers
deal
with
grammatical
problems
.
On
the
whole
they
maintain
much
the
same
high
standard
,
but
they
are
much
more
difficult
to
discuss
in
detail
because
of
their
wider
variety
of
subject
matter
.
My
comments
must
be
briefer
than
the
papers
deserve
.
W.
H.
Whiteley
writes
on
The
Verbal
Radical
In
Iraqw
.
This
must
be
considered
primarily
an
amendment
and
supplement
to
his
early
A
Short
Description
Of
Item-Categories
In
Iraqw
.
It
exhibits
much
the
same
descriptive
technique
and
is
open
to
much
the
same
criticisms
.
The
treatment
seems
unnecessarily
loose-jointed
and
complex
,
largely
because
the
method
is
lax
and
the
analysis
seems
never
to
be
pushed
to
a
satisfactory
or
even
a
consistent
stopping-point
.
There
are
more
stems
per
item
in
Athabascan
,
which
expresses
the
fact
that
the
Athabascan
languages
have
undergone
somewhat
more
change
in
diverging
from
proto-Athabascan
than
the
Yokuts
languages
from
proto-Yokuts
.
This
may
be
because
the
Athabascan
divergence
began
earlier
;
;
or
again
because
the
Athabascan
languages
spread
over
a
very
much
larger
territory
(
including
three
wholly
separated
areas
)
;
;
or
both
.
The
differentiation
,
however
,
is
not
very
much
greater
,
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
Athabascan
shows
3.46
stems
per
meaning
slot
as
against
2.75
for
Yokuts
,
with
a
slightly
greater
number
of
languages
represented
in
our
sample
:
24
as
against
21
.
(
On
deduction
of
one-eighth
from
3.46
,
the
stem
/
item
rate
becomes
3.03
against
2.75
in
equivalent
number
of
languages
.
)
These
general
facts
are
mentioned
to
make
clear
that
the
total
situation
in
the
two
families
is
similar
enough
to
warrant
comparison
.
The
greatest
difference
in
the
two
sets
of
figures
is
due
to
differences
in
the
two
sets
of
lists
used
.
These
differences
in
turn
result
from
the
fact
that
my
Yokuts
vocabularies
were
built
up
of
terms
selected
mainly
to
insure
unambiguity
of
English
meaning
between
illiterate
informants
and
myself
,
within
a
compact
and
uniform
territorial
area
,
but
that
Hoijer's
vocabulary
is
based
on
Swadesh's
second
glottochronological
list
which
aims
at
eliminating
all
items
which
might
be
culturally
or
geographically
determined
.
Swadesh
in
short
was
trying
to
develop
a
basic
list
that
was
universal
;
;
I
,
one
that
was
specifically
adapted
to
the
San
Joaquin
Valley
.
The
result
is
that
I
included
70
animal
names
,
but
Swadesh
only
4
;
;
and
somewhat
similarly
for
plants
,
16
as
against
4
.
Swadesh
,
and
therefore
Hoijer
,
felt
compelled
to
omit
all
terms
denoting
species
or
even
genera
(
ox
,
vulture
,
salmon
,
yellow
pine
,
manzanita
)
;
;
their
classes
of
animal
and
plant
terms
are
restricted
to
generalizations
or
recurrent
parts
(
fish
,
bird
,
tree
,
grass
,
horn
,
tail
,
bark
,
root
)
.
The
groups
are
therefore
really
non-comparable
in
content
as
well
as
in
size
.
Other
classes
are
included
only
by
myself
(
interrogatives
,
adverbs
)
or
only
by
Swadesh
and
Hoijer
(
pronouns
,
demonstratives
)
.
What
we
have
left
as
reasonably
comparable
are
four
classes
:
(
1
)
body
parts
and
products
,
which
with
a
proportionally
nearly
even
representation
(
51
terms
out
of
253
,
25
out
of
100
)
come
out
with
nearly
even
ratios
;
;
2.6
and
2.7
;
;
(
2
)
Nature
(
29
terms
against
17
)
,
ratios
3.3
versus
4.1
;
;
(
3
)
adjectives
(
16
,
15
terms
)
,
ratios
3.9
versus
4.7
;
;
(
4
)
verbs
(
9
,
22
terms
)
,
ratios
4.0
versus
3.4
.
It
will
be
seen
that
where
the
scope
is
similar
,
the
Athabascan
ratios
come
out
somewhat
higher
(
as
indeed
they
ought
to
with
a
total
ratio
of
2.8
as
against
3.5
or
4
:
5
)
except
for
verbs
,
where
alone
the
Athabascan
ratio
is
lower
.
This
exception
may
be
connected
with
Hoijer's
use
of
a
much
higher
percentage
of
verbs
:
22%
of
his
total
list
as
against
3.5%
in
mine
.
Or
the
exception
may
be
due
to
a
particular
durability
peculiar
to
the
Athabascan
verb
.
More
word
class
ratios
determined
in
more
languages
will
no
doubt
ultimately
answer
the
question
.
5
.
If
word
classes
differ
in
their
resistance
or
liability
to
stem
replacement
within
meaning
slot
,
it
is
conceivable
that
individual
meanings
also
differ
with
fair
consistence
trans-lingually
.
Hoijer's
Athabascan
and
my
Yokuts
share
71
identical
meanings
(
with
allowance
for
several
near-synonyms
like
stomach-belly
,
big-large
,
long-far
,
many-much
,
die-dead
,
say-speak
)
.
For
Yokuts
,
I
tabulated
these
71
items
in
five
columns
,
according
as
they
were
expressed
by
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
and
more
than
4
stems
.
The
totals
for
these
five
categories
are
not
too
uneven
,
namely
20
,
15
,
11
,
16
,
9
respectively
.
For
Athabascan
,
with
a
greater
range
of
stems
,
the
first
two
of
five
corresponding
columns
were
identical
,
1
and
2
stems
;
;
the
three
others
had
to
be
spread
somewhat
,
and
are
headed
respectively
Af
;
;
Af
;
;
and
Af
stems
.
While
the
particular
limits
of
these
groupings
may
seem
artificially
arbitrary
,
they
do
fairly
express
a
corresponding
grouping
of
more
variable
material
,
and
they
eventuate
also
in
five
classes
,
along
a
similar
scale
,
containing
approximately
equal
numbers
of
cases
,
namely
19
,
14
,
15
,
11
,
12
in
Athabascan
.
When
now
we
count
the
frequency
of
the
71
items
in
the
two
language
families
appearing
in
the
same
column
or
grade
,
or
one
column
or
grade
apart
,
or
two
or
three
or
four
,
we
find
these
differences
:
Af
.
This
distribution
can
be
summarized
by
averaging
the
distance
in
grades
apart
:
Af
;
;
which
,
divided
by
Af
gives
a
mean
of
1.07
grades
apart
.
If
the
distribution
of
the
71
items
were
wholly
concordant
in
the
two
families
,
the
distance
would
of
course
be
0
.
If
it
were
wholly
random
and
unrelated
,
it
would
be
2.0
,
assuming
the
five
classes
were
equal
in
n
,
which
approximately
they
are
.
The
actual
mean
of
1.07
being
about
halfway
between
0
of
complete
correlation
and
2.0
of
no
correlation
,
it
is
evident
that
there
is
a
pretty
fair
degree
of
similarity
in
the
behavior
even
of
particular
individual
items
of
meaning
as
regards
long-term
stem
displacement
.

In
1960
,
David
D.
Thomas
published
Basic
Vocabulary
In
some
Mon-Khmer
Languages
(
AL
2
,
No.
3
,
pp.
7
-
11
)
,
which
compares
8
Mon-Khmer
languages
with
the
I-E
language
data
on
which
Swadesh
based
the
revised
retention
rate
(
Af
)
in
place
of
original
(
Af
)
,
and
his
revised
100
word
basic
glottochronological
list
in
Towards
Greater
Accuracy
(
IJAL
21
:
:
121
-
137
)
.
Thomas'
findings
are
,
first
,
``
that
the
individual
items
vary
greatly
and
unpredictably
in
their
persistence
''
;
;
but
,
second
,
``
that
the
semantic
groups
are
surprisingly
unvarying
in
their
average
persistence
''
(
as
between
M-K
and
I-E
)
.
His
first
conclusion
,
on
behavior
of
individual
items
,
is
negative
,
whereas
mine
(
on
Ath.
and
Yok.
)
was
partially
positive
.
His
second
conclusion
,
on
semantic
word
classes
,
agrees
with
mine
.
This
second
conclusion
,
independently
arrived
at
by
independent
study
of
material
from
two
pairs
of
language
families
as
different
and
remote
from
one
another
as
these
four
are
,
cannot
be
ignored
.
Thomas
also
presents
a
simple
equation
for
deriving
an
index
of
persistence
,
which
weights
not
only
the
number
of
stems
(
'
roots
'
)
per
meaning
,
but
their
relative
frequency
.
Thus
his
persistence
values
for
some
stem
frequencies
per
meaning
are
:
stem
identical
in
8
languages
,
100%
;
;
stem
frequencies
7
and
1
,
86%
;
;
stem
frequencies
4
and
4
,
64%
;
;
stem
frequencies
4
,
3
,
and
1
,
57%
.
His
formula
will
have
to
be
weighed
,
may
be
altered
or
improved
,
and
it
should
be
tested
on
additional
bodies
of
material
.
But
consideration
of
the
frequency
of
stems
per
constant
meaning
seems
to
be
established
as
having
significance
in
comparative
situations
with
diachronic
and
classificatory
relevance
;
;
and
Gleason
presumably
is
on
the
way
with
a
further
contribution
in
this
area
.
As
to
relative
frequencies
of
competing
roots

Thomas
with
his
'
weighting
'
seems
to
be
the
first
to
have
considered
the
significance
this
might
have
.
The
problem
needs
further
exploration
.
I
was
at
least
conscious
of
the
distinction
in
my
full
Yokuts
presentation
that
awaits
publication
,
in
which
,
in
listing
'
Two-Stem
Meanings
'
,
I
set
off
by
asterisks
those
forms
in
which
N
of
stem
B
was
Af
of
stem
A/3
,
the
unasterisked
ones
standing
for
Af
;
;
or
under
'
Four
Stems
'
,
I
set
off
by
asterisks
cases
where
the
combined
N
of
stems
Af
was
Af
.

.
These
findings
,
and
others
which
will
in
time
be
developed
,
will
affect
the
method
of
glottochronological
inquiry
.
If
adjectival
meanings
show
relatively
low
retentiveness
of
stems
,
as
I
am
confident
will
prove
to
be
the
case
in
most
languages
of
the
world
,
why
should
our
basic
lists
include
15
per
cent
of
these
unstable
forms
,
but
only
8
per
cent
of
animals
and
plants
which
replace
much
more
slowly
?
?
Had
Hoijer
substituted
for
his
15
adjectival
slots
15
good
animal
and
plant
items
,
his
rate
of
stem
replacement
would
have
been
lower
and
the
age
of
Athabascan
language
separation
smaller
.
And
irrespective
of
the
outcome
in
centuries
elapsed
since
splitting
,
calculations
obviously
carry
more
concordant
and
comparable
meaning
if
they
deal
with
the
most
stable
units
than
with
variously
unstable
ones
.
It
is
evident
that
Swadesh
has
not
only
had
much
experience
with
basic
vocabulary
in
many
languages
but
has
acquired
great
tact
and
feeling
for
the
expectable
behavior
of
lexical
items
.
Why
then
this
urge
to
include
unstable
items
in
his
basic
list
?
?
It
is
the
urge
to
obtain
a
list
as
free
of
geographical
and
cultural
conditioning
as
possible
.
And
why
that
insistence
?
?
It
is
the
hope
of
attaining
a
list
of
items
of
universal
occurrence
.
But
it
is
becoming
increasingly
evident
that
such
a
hope
is
a
snare
.
Not
that
such
a
list
cannot
be
constructed
;
;
but
the
nearer
it
comes
to
attaining
universality
,
the
less
significant
will
it
be
linguistically
.
Its
terms
will
tend
to
be
labile
or
vague
,
and
they
will
fit
actual
languages
more
and
more
badly
.
The
practical
operational
problem
of
lexicostatistics
is
the
establishment
of
a
basic
list
of
items
of
meaning
against
which
the
particular
forms
or
terms
of
languages
can
be
matched
as
the
medium
of
comparison
.
The
most
important
quality
of
the
meanings
is
that
they
should
be
as
definable
as
possible
.
In
proportion
as
meanings
are
concrete
,
we
can
better
rely
on
their
being
insulated
and
distinctive
.
An
elephant
or
a
fox
or
a
swan
or
a
cocopalm
or
a
banana
possess
in
unusually
high
degree
this
quality
of
obvious
,
common-sense
,
indubitable
identity
,
as
do
an
eye
or
tooth
or
nail
.
They
isolate
out
easily
,
naturally
,
and
unambiguously
from
the
continuum
of
nature
and
existence
;
;
and
they
should
be
given
priority
in
the
basic
list
as
long
as
they
continue
to
show
these
qualities
.
With
the
universal
list
as
his
weapon
,
Swadesh
has
extended
his
march
of
conquest
farther
and
farther
into
the
past
,
eight
,
ten
,
twelve
millennia
back
.
And
he
has
proclaimed
greater
or
less
affiliation
between
all
Western
hemisphere
languages
.
Some
of
this
may
prove
to
be
true
,
or
even
considerable
of
it
,
whether
by
genetic
ramification
or
by
diffusion
and
coalescence
.
But
the
farther
out
he
moves
,
the
thinner
will
be
his
hold
on
conclusive
evidence
,
and
the
larger
the
speculative
component
in
his
inferences
.
He
has
traversed
provinces
and
kingdoms
,
but
he
has
not
consolidated
them
behind
him
,
nor
does
he
control
them
.
He
has
announced
results
on
Hokan
,
Penutian
,
Uto-Aztecan
,
and
almost
all
other
American
families
and
phyla
,
and
has
diagrammed
their
degree
of
interrelation
;
;
but
he
has
not
worked
out
by
lexicostatistics
one
comprehensively
complete
classification
of
even
a
single
family
other
than
Salish
.
That
is
his
privilege
.
The
remote
,
cloudy
,
possible
has
values
of
its
own
--
values
of
scope
,
stimulus
,
potential
,
and
imagination
.
But
there
is
also
a
firm
aspect
to
lexicostatistics
:
the
aspect
of
learning
the
internal
organization
of
obvious
natural
genetic
groups
of
languages
as
well
as
their
more
remote
and
elusive
external
links
;
;
of
classification
first
,
with
elapsed
age
merely
a
by-product
;
;
of
acquiring
evidential
knowledge
of
what
happened
in
Athabascan
,
in
Yokuts
,
in
Uto-Aztecan
in
the
last
few
thousand
years
as
well
as
forecasting
what
more
anciently
may
have
happened
between
them
.
This
involves
step-by-step
progress
,
and
such
will
have
to
be
the
day-by-day
work
of
lexicostatistics
as
a
growing
body
of
scientific
inquiry
.
If
of
the
founders
of
glottochronology
Swadesh
has
escaped
our
steady
plodding
,
and
Lees
has
repudiated
his
own
share
in
the
founding
,
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
swerve
.
8
.
There
is
no
apparent
reason
why
we
should
feel
bound
by
Swadesh's
rules
and
procedure
since
his
predilections
and
aims
have
grown
so
vast
.
It
seems
time
to
consider
a
revision
of
operational
procedures
for
lexicostatistic
studies
on
a
more
humble
,
solid
,
and
limited
basis
.
I
would
propose
,
first
,
an
abandonment
of
attempts
at
a
universal
lexical
list
,
as
intrinsically
unachievable
,
and
operationally
inadequate
in
proportion
as
it
is
achieved
.
I
would
propose
,
next
,
as
the
prime
requirement
for
constitution
of
new
basic
lists
,
items
whose
forms
show
as
high
an
empirical
retention
rate
as
possible
.
There
would
be
no
conceivable
sense
in
going
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
selecting
items
whose
forms
are
the
most
unstable
.
An
attempted
middle
course
might
lead
to
devices
like
a
5000-word
alphabetized
dictionary
from
which
every
fiftieth
word
was
selected
.
Doubtless
it
was
inevitable
that
differences
of
opinion
should
arise
about
the
methods
for
applying
these
policies
.
It
was
nevertheless
almost
incredible
that
four
years
after
Yalta
there
should
be
a
complete
split
over
Germany
,
with
hot
heads
on
both
sides
planning
to
use
the
Germans
against
their
former
allies
,
and
with
Nazi-minded
Germans
expecting
to
recover
their
power
by
fighting
on
one
side
or
the
other
.

Poland
frontiers
.
When
the
Yalta
Conference
opened
,
the
American
policy
of
postponing
all
discussion
of
Russia's
western
boundaries
until
the
peace
conference
had
broken
down
.
Starting
in
great
force
late
in
December
,
from
a
line
stretching
from
East
Prussia
to
Budapest
,
the
Red
armies
had
swept
two
hundred
miles
across
Poland
to
the
Oder
,
thirty
miles
from
Berlin
,
and
the
Upper
Danube
region
was
being
rapidly
overrun
,
while
the
Western
Allies
had
not
yet
occupied
all
of
the
left
bank
of
the
Rhine
.
The
long
delay
in
opening
the
Second
Front
was
now
working
to
Russia's
advantage
.
The
West
was
now
glad
to
propose
the
1919
Curzon
Line
,
which
was
substantially
Russia's
1941
border
,
as
the
boundary
between
Russia
and
Poland
.
When
this
proposal
was
made
,
Stalin
spoke
with
stronger
emotion
than
at
any
other
time
during
the
Conference
.
He
stood
up
to
emphasize
his
strong
feeling
on
the
subject
.
The
bitter
memory
of
Russia's
exclusion
from
the
Paris
Peace
Conference
and
of
the
West's
effort
to
stamp
out
Bolshevism
at
its
birth
boiled
up
within
him
.
``
You
would
drive
us
into
shame
''
,
he
declared
.
The
White
Russians
and
the
Ukrainians
would
say
that
Stalin
and
Molotov
were
far
less
reliable
defenders
of
Russia
than
Curzon
and
Clemenceau
.
Yet
after
long
and
earnest
discussion
Stalin
accepted
the
Curzon
Line
and
even
agreed
voluntarily
that
there
should
be
digressions
from
that
line
of
five
to
eight
kilometers
in
favor
of
Poland
in
some
regions
.
He
did
not
mind
the
Line
itself
,
which
Churchill
declared
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
on
February
27
,
1945
,
he
had
always
believed
to
be
``
just
and
right
''
,
but
he
did
not
want
it
called
by
a
hated
name
.
The
West
had
long
since
forgotten
the
events
of
1919
,
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
the
Red
leaders
,
who
felt
that
they
had
suffered
great
injustice
in
that
period
.
In
the
Dunn-Atherton
memorandum
of
February
4
,
1942
,
the
State
Department
had
expected
to
be
able
to
hold
Russia
in
check
by
withholding
agreement
to
her
1941
boundaries
.
Now
Stalin
made
it
clear
that
he
meant
to
move
Poland's
western
borders
deep
into
Germany
,
back
to
the
western
Neisse-Oder
River
lines
,
taking
not
only
East
Prussia
and
all
of
Silesia
but
Pomerania
and
the
tip
of
Brandenburg
,
back
to
and
including
Stettin
.
From
six
to
nine
million
additional
Germans
would
be
evicted
,
though
most
would
have
fled
,
and
Poland
would
receive
far
more
from
Germany
than
the
poor
territories
,
including
the
great
Pripet
Marshes
,
which
she
lost
to
Russia
.
Stalin
declared
that
he
preferred
to
continue
the
war
a
little
longer
,
``
although
it
costs
us
blood
''
,
in
order
to
give
Poland
compensation
in
the
West
at
the
expense
of
the
Germans
.
By
this
time
Churchill
was
not
so
cordial
toward
moving
Poland
westward
as
he
had
been
at
Teheran
,
where
he
and
Eden
had
both
heartily
approved
the
idea
.
After
``
a
prolonged
study
of
the
Oder
line
on
a
map
''
,
at
Teheran
,
Churchill
``
liked
the
picture
''
.
He
would
tell
the
Poles
,
he
said
,
that
they
had
been
``
given
a
fine
place
to
live
in
,
more
than
three
hundred
miles
each
way
''
.
At
Yalta
he
thought
more
about
the
six
million
Germans
who
would
have
to
leave
,
trying
to
find
work
in
Germany
,
and
Roosevelt
objected
to
the
Western
Neisse
River
being
chosen
in
the
south
,
instead
of
the
Eastern
Neisse
,
both
of
which
flow
into
the
Oder
.
The
issue
was
left
in
abeyance
,
presumably
for
the
peace
conference
.
However
,
there
was
no
real
question
of
the
justice
of
creating
a
strong
Poland
,
both
industrially
and
agriculturally
,
and
one
unplagued
by
large
minorities
of
Germans
or
Russians
.
The
moving
of
millions
of
the
German
master-race
,
from
the
very
heart
of
Junkerdom
,
to
make
room
for
the
Polish
Slavs
whom
they
had
enslaved
and
openly
planned
to
exterminate
was
a
drastic
operation
,
but
there
was
little
doubt
that
it
was
historically
justified
.
Government
.
Of
more
importance
to
the
West
than
Poland's
boundaries
was
the
character
of
her
government
.
At
Yalta
the
West
still
believed
that
Eastern
Europe
could
be
kept
in
its
orbit
,
in
spite
of
the
onrushing
Soviet
armies
.
Though
little
democracy
had
ever
been
practised
in
this
region
,
and
much
of
it
was
still
ruled
by
feudalistic
means
,
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
at
least
the
forms
of
Western
democracy
would
be
established
in
this
area
and
Western
capitalism
preserved
within
it
.
Believing
devoutly
as
they
did
in
Anglo-Saxon
institutions
,
it
was
important
to
both
Roosevelt
and
Churchill
that
the
Poles
should
have
them
.
The
issue
was
acute
because
the
exiled
Polish
Government
in
London
,
supported
in
the
main
by
Britain
,
was
still
competing
with
the
new
Lublin
Government
formed
behind
the
Red
Army
.
More
time
was
spent
in
trying
to
marry
these
incompatibles
than
over
any
subject
discussed
at
Yalta
.
The
result
was
an
agreement
that
the
Lublin
Government
should
be
``
reorganized
on
a
broader
democratic
basis
with
the
inclusion
of
democratic
leaders
from
Poland
itself
and
from
the
Poles
abroad
''
,
and
pledged
to
hold
``
free
and
unfettered
elections
as
soon
as
possible
on
the
basis
of
universal
suffrage
and
secret
ballot
''
.
All
``
democratic
and
anti-Nazi
parties
''
were
to
have
the
right
to
campaign
.
Roosevelt
acted
as
moderator
of
the
long
debate
on
this
issue
.
It
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
Churchill
,
since
Britain
had
declared
war
in
behalf
of
Poland
.
To
Stalin
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
.
He
made
this
completely
clear
.
Speaking
with
``
great
earnestness
''
,
he
said
:
``
For
the
Russian
people
,
the
question
of
Poland
is
not
only
a
question
of
honor
but
also
a
question
of
security
.
Throughout
history
,
Poland
has
been
the
corridor
through
which
the
enemy
has
passed
into
Russia
.
Twice
in
the
last
thirty
years
our
enemies
,
the
Germans
,
have
passed
through
this
corridor
.
It
is
in
Russia's
interest
that
Poland
should
be
strong
and
powerful
,
in
a
position
to
shut
the
door
of
this
corridor
by
her
own
force
.
It
is
necessary
that
Poland
should
be
free
,
independent
in
power
.
Therefore
,
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
honor
but
of
life
and
death
for
the
Soviet
state
''
.
In
other
words
,
the
Soviet
Union
was
determined
to
create
a
Poland
so
strong
as
to
be
a
powerful
bulwark
against
Germany
and
so
closely
tied
to
Russia
that
there
would
never
be
any
question
of
her
serving
as
a
cordon
sanitaire
against
the
Soviets
or
posing
as
an
independent
,
balancing
power
in
between
Russia
and
Germany
.
Byrnes
says
that
invariably
thereafter
the
Soviets
used
the
same
security
argument
to
justify
their
course
in
Poland
.
This
reasoning
was
also
as
inevitable
as
anything
could
be
.
Any
free
elections
that
were
to
be
held
in
Poland
would
have
to
produce
a
government
in
which
Moscow
had
complete
confidence
,
and
all
pressure
from
the
West
for
free
voting
by
anti-Soviet
elements
in
Poland
would
be
met
by
restrictions
on
voting
by
these
elements
.

.
Liberated
Europe
In
even
greater
degree
the
same
rule
applied
to
the
remainder
of
Eastern
Europe
,
where
the
upper
classes
had
generally
collaborated
with
the
Nazis
,
even
to
the
extent
of
sending
millions
of
their
peasants
into
Russia
as
a
part
of
Hitler's
armies
.
But
at
Yalta
the
conflicting
expectations
of
East
and
West
were
merged
into
an
agreement
by
the
Big
Three
to
assist
all
liberated
countries
in
Europe
``
to
create
democratic
institutions
of
their
own
choice
''
.
In
any
case
``
here
in
their
judgment
conditions
require
''
(
italics
added
)
they
would
``
form
interim
governmental
authorities
broadly
representative
of
all
democratic
elements
in
the
population
and
pledged
to
the
earliest
possible
establishment
through
free
elections
of
governments
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
''
.
Other
similar
affirmations
in
the
Declaration
on
Liberated
Europe
seemed
to
assure
democratic
institutions
on
the
Western
model
.
Later
it
developed
that
the
Soviets
had
a
very
different
interpretation
of
democracy
,
which
will
be
discussed
later
,
and
their
judgment
never
told
them
that
the
Big
Three
should
unite
in
establishing
democratic
conditions
,
as
we
understand
them
,
within
their
zone
of
influence
.
Professor
McNeill
thinks
that
at
Yalta
,
Stalin
did
not
fully
realize
the
dilemma
which
faced
him
,
that
he
thought
the
exclusion
of
the
anti-Soviet
voters
from
East
European
elections
would
not
be
greatly
resented
by
his
allies
,
while
neither
Roosevelt
nor
Churchill
frankly
faced
``
the
fact
that
,
in
Poland
at
least
,
genuinely
free
democratic
elections
would
return
governments
unfriendly
to
Russia
''
,
by
any
definition
of
international
friendliness
.
Also
war-time
propaganda
and
cooperation
had
``
obscured
the
differences
between
Russian
and
Western
ideas
of
democracy
''
,
and
it
seemed
better
to
have
them
covered
by
verbal
formulae
than
to
imperil
the
military
victories
over
Germany
and
Japan
.
The
application
of
these
formulae
could
not
please
both
sides
,
for
they
really
attempted
to
marry
the
impossible
to
the
inevitable
.
While
obliged
to
concede
governments
in
East
Europe
allied
with
the
Soviet
Union
instead
of
opposed
to
it
,
we
thought
we
had
preserved
our
social
and
economic
system
in
East
Europe
.
This
illusion
was
described
in
a
far-sighted
editorial
in
The
New
York
Herald
Tribune
,
on
March
5
,
1947
,
in
connection
with
the
submission
of
the
satellite
peace
treaties
to
the
Senate
.
In
doing
so
Marshall
and
Byrnes
were
``
asking
for
the
ratification
of
a
grim
lesson
in
the
facts
of
international
life
''
.
We
had
entertained
exaggerated
ideas
about
our
victory
automatically
establishing
our
system
throughout
the
world
.
``
We
were
troubled
about
the
fate
of
the
Baltic
States
.
Yalta
left
us
with
comforting
illusions
of
a
Western
capitalist-democratic
political
economy
reigning
supreme
up
to
the
Curzon
line
and
the
borders
of
Bessarabia
''
(
Italics
added
)
.
This
is
a
penetrating
description
of
our
post-war
illusion
,
which
applied
to
other
areas
than
East
Europe
.
The
same
editorial
continued
that
``
We
expected
to
democratize
Japan
and
Korea
and
to
see
a
new
China
pattern
itself
easily
on
our
institutions
.
We
expected
,
in
short
,
that
most
of
the
world
would
make
itself
over
in
our
image
and
that
it
would
be
relatively
simple
,
from
such
a
position
,
to
deal
with
the
localized
aberrations
of
the
Soviet
Union
''
.
Yet
actually
``
the
image
corresponded
in
no
way
to
the
actualities
of
the
post-war
world
.
Neither
our
military
,
our
economic
nor
our
ideological
power
reached
far
enough
''
to
determine
the
fate
of
East
Europe
.
Then
the
editorial
added
prophetically
:
``
how
far
they
may
reach
in
Asia
is
yet
undetermined
,
but
they
fall
far
short
of
our
dreams
of
the
war
conferences
''
.
Here
is
the
best
short
explanation
of
the
origins
of
the
Cold
War
that
has
been
written
.
Failing
to
heed
the
lesson
so
clearly
contained
in
the
satellite
treaties
,
President
Truman
re-declared
the
Cold
War
on
March
12
,
1947
,
in
the
Truman
Doctrine
,
exactly
one
week
after
the
Herald
Tribune
editorial
was
written
,
and
a
year
after
the
Cold
War
had
been
announced
by
Churchill
at
Fulton
,
Missouri
,
in
Truman's
presence
.
Then
China
promptly
went
Communist
,
and
Mr.
Truman
had
to
fight
the
interminable
Korean
war
for
the
democratization
of
Korea
before
we
learned
how
far
our
writ
did
``
reach
in
Asia
''
.
Years
of
war
,
strain
,
and
hatred
;
;
of
heavy
arms
expenditures
and
constant
danger
of
another
world
war
had
to
ensue
before
the
United
States
could
bring
itself
to
accept
the
two
chief
results
of
World
War
2
,
--
Communist
control
of
East
Europe
and
China
--
a
new
balance
of
power
.
While
the
Cold
War
raged
it
was
easy
to
blame
it
all
on
Yalta
.
Yet
,
in
summarizing
a
series
of
careful
essays
on
the
Yalta
Conference
,
Forrest
Pogue
could
find
no
basis
for
Yalta
becoming
``
a
symbol
for
betrayal
and
a
shibboleth
for
the
opponents
of
Roosevelt
and
international
cooperation
''
.
When
the
Yalta
Papers
were
finally
published
with
great
fanfare
they
had
revealed
no
betrayal
by
anyone
.
An
analysis
of
the
election
falls
naturally
in
four
parts
.
First
is
the
long
and
still
somewhat
obscure
process
of
preparation
,
planning
and
discussion
.
Preparation
began
slightly
more
than
a
year
after
independence
with
the
first
steps
to
organize
rural
communes
.
All
political
interests
supported
electoral
planning
,
although
there
are
some
signs
that
the
inherent
uncertainties
of
a
popular
judgment
led
to
some
procrastination
.
The
second
major
aspect
of
the
election
is
the
actual
procedure
of
registration
,
nomination
and
voting
.
Considerable
technical
skill
was
used
and
the
administration
of
the
elections
was
generally
above
reproach
.
However
,
the
regionally
differentiated
results
,
which
appear
below
in
tables
,
are
interesting
evidence
of
the
problems
of
developing
self-government
under
even
the
most
favorable
circumstances
.
A
third
aspect
,
and
probably
the
one
open
to
most
controversy
,
is
the
results
of
the
election
.
The
electoral
procedure
prevented
the
ready
identification
of
party
affiliation
,
but
all
vitally
interested
parties
,
including
the
government
itself
,
were
busily
engaged
in
determining
the
party
identifications
of
all
successful
candidates
the
month
following
the
elections
.
The
fourth
and
concluding
point
will
be
to
estimate
the
long-run
significance
of
the
elections
and
how
they
figure
in
the
current
pattern
of
internal
politics
.
Elections
have
figured
prominently
in
nearly
every
government
program
and
official
address
since
independence
.
They
were
stressed
in
the
speeches
of
Si
Mubarak
Bekkai
when
the
first
Council
of
Ministers
was
formed
and
again
when
the
Istiqlal
took
a
leading
role
in
the
second
Council
.
King
Muhammad
5
,
was
known
to
be
most
sympathetic
to
the
formation
of
local
self-government
and
made
the
first
firm
promise
of
elections
on
May
Day
,
1957
.
There
followed
a
long
and
sometimes
bitter
discussion
of
the
feasibility
of
elections
for
the
fall
of
1957
,
in
which
it
appears
that
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
took
the
most
pessimistic
view
and
that
the
Istiqlal
was
something
less
than
enthusiastic
.
Since
the
complicated
process
of
establishing
new
communes
and
reviewing
the
rudimentary
plan
left
by
the
French
did
not
even
begin
until
the
fall
of
1957
,
this
goal
appears
somewhat
ambitious
.
From
the
very
beginning
the
electoral
discussions
raised
fundamental
issues
in
Moroccan
politics
,
precisely
the
type
of
questions
that
were
most
difficult
to
resolve
in
the
new
government
.
Until
the
Charter
of
Liberties
was
issued
in
the
fall
of
1958
,
there
were
no
guarantees
of
the
right
to
assemble
or
to
organize
for
political
purposes
.
The
Istiqlal
was
still
firmly
united
in
1957
,
but
the
P.D.I.
(
Parti
Democratique
de
l'Independance
)
,
the
most
important
minor
party
at
the
time
,
objected
to
the
Istiqlal's
predominance
in
the
civil
service
and
influence
in
Radio
Maroc
.
There
were
rumors
that
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
favored
an
arbitrary
,
``
non-political
''
process
,
which
were
indirectly
affirmed
when
the
King
personally
intervened
in
the
planned
meetings
.
The
day
following
his
intervention
the
palace
issued
a
statement
reassuring
the
citizens
that
``
the
possibility
of
introducing
appeals
concerning
the
establishment
of
electoral
lists
,
lists
of
candidates
and
finally
the
holding
of
the
consultation
itself
''
would
be
supported
by
the
King
himself
.
The
Ifni
crisis
in
the
fall
of
1957
postponed
further
consideration
of
elections
,
but
French
consultants
were
called
in
and
notices
of
further
investigation
appeared
from
time
to
time
.
In
January
,
1958
,
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
announced
that
an
election
law
was
ready
to
be
submitted
to
the
King
,
the
rumors
of
election
dates
appeared
once
again
,
first
for
spring
of
1958
and
later
for
the
summer
.
Although
the
government
was
probably
prepared
for
elections
by
mid-1958
,
the
first
decision
was
no
doubt
made
more
difficult
as
party
strife
multiplied
.
In
late
1957
the
M.P.
(
Mouvement
Populaire
)
appeared
and
in
the
spring
of
1958
the
internal
strains
of
the
Istiqlal
was
revealed
when
the
third
Council
of
Government
under
Balafrej
was
formed
without
support
from
progressive
elements
in
the
party
.
The
parties
were
on
the
whole
unprepared
for
elections
,
while
the
people
were
still
experiencing
post-independence
let-down
and
suffering
the
after-effects
of
poor
harvests
in
1957
.
Despite
the
internal
and
international
crises
that
harassed
Morocco
the
elections
remained
a
central
issue
.
They
figured
prominently
in
the
Balafrej
government
of
May
,
1958
,
which
the
King
was
reportedly
determined
to
keep
in
office
until
elections
could
be
held
.
But
the
eagerly
sought
``
homogeneity
''
of
the
Balafrej
Council
of
Government
was
never
achieved
as
the
Istiqlal
quarreled
over
foreign
policy
,
labor
politics
and
economic
development
.
By
December
,
1958
,
when
'
Abdallah
Ibrahim
became
President
of
the
Council
,
elections
had
even
greater
importance
.
They
were
increasingly
looked
upon
as
a
means
of
establishing
the
new
rural
communes
as
the
focus
of
a
new
,
constructive
national
effort
.
To
minimize
the
chances
of
repeating
the
Balafrej
debacle
the
Ibrahim
government
was
formed
.
A
titre
personnel
and
a
special
office
was
created
in
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
to
plan
and
to
conduct
the
elections
.
By
this
time
there
is
little
doubt
but
what
election
plans
were
complete
.
There
remained
only
the
delicate
task
of
maneuvering
the
laws
through
the
labyrinth
of
Palace
politics
and
making
a
small
number
of
policy
decisions
.
From
the
rather
tortuous
history
of
electoral
planning
in
Morocco
an
important
point
emerges
concerning
the
first
elections
in
a
developing
country
and
evaluating
their
results
.
In
the
new
country
the
electoral
process
is
considered
as
a
means
of
resolving
fundamental
,
and
sometimes
bitter
,
differences
among
leaders
and
also
as
a
source
of
policy
guidance
.
In
the
absence
of
a
reservoir
of
political
consensus
each
organized
political
group
hopes
that
the
elections
will
give
them
new
prominence
,
but
in
a
system
where
there
is
as
yet
no
place
for
the
less
prominent
.
Lacking
the
respected
and
effective
institutions
that
consensus
helps
provide
,
minority
parties
,
such
as
the
P.D.I.
in
1957
and
the
progressive
Istiqlal
faction
in
1958
,
clamor
for
elections
when
out
of
power
,
but
are
not
at
all
certain
they
wish
to
be
controlled
by
popular
choice
when
in
power
.
Those
in
power
tend
to
procrastinate
and
even
to
repudiate
the
electoral
process
.
The
tendency
to
treat
elections
as
an
instrument
of
self-interest
rather
than
an
instrument
of
national
interest
had
two
important
effects
on
electoral
planning
in
Morocco
.
At
the
central
level
the
scrutin
uninominal
voting
system
was
selected
over
some
form
of
the
scrutin
de
liste
system
,
even
though
the
latter
had
been
recommended
by
Duverger
and
favored
by
all
political
parties
.
The
choice
of
the
single
member
district
was
dictated
to
a
certain
extent
by
problems
of
communication
and
understanding
in
the
more
remote
areas
of
the
country
,
but
it
also
served
to
minimize
the
national
political
value
of
the
elections
.
Although
the
elections
were
for
local
officials
,
it
was
not
necessary
to
conduct
the
elections
so
as
to
prevent
parties
from
publicly
identifying
their
candidates
.
With
multiple
member
districts
the
still
fragmentary
local
party
organizations
could
have
operated
more
effectively
and
parties
might
have
been
encouraged
to
state
their
positions
more
clearly
.
Both
parties
and
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
were
busily
at
work
after
the
elections
trying
to
unearth
the
political
affiliations
of
the
successful
candidates
and
,
thereby
,
give
the
elections
a
confidential
but
known
degree
of
national
political
significance
.
Since
a
national
interpretation
cannot
be
avoided
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
elections
were
not
held
in
a
way
to
maximize
party
responsibility
and
the
educational
effect
of
mass
political
participation
.
The
general
setting
of
the
Moroccan
election
may
also
encourage
the
deterioration
of
local
party
organization
.
The
concentration
of
effective
power
in
Rabat
leads
not
only
to
party
bickering
,
but
to
distraction
from
local
activity
that
might
have
had
many
auxiliary
benefits
in
addition
to
contributing
to
more
meaningful
elections
.
Interesting
evidence
can
be
found
in
the
results
of
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
elections
,
which
took
place
three
weeks
before
national
elections
.
The
Istiqlal-sponsored
U.M.C.I.A.
(
L'Union
Marocaine
Des
Commercants
,
Industrialistes
et
Artisans
)
was
opposed
by
candidates
of
the
new
U.N.F.P.
(
L'Union
National
Des
Forces
Populaires
)
in
nearly
all
urban
centers
.
As
the
more
conservative
group
with
strong
backing
from
wealthy
businessmen
,
the
U.M.C.I.A.
was
generally
favored
against
the
more
progressive
,
labor-based
U.N.F.P.
.
The
newer
party
campaigned
heavily
,
while
the
older
,
more
confident
party
expected
the
Moroccan
merchants
and
small
businessmen
to
support
them
as
they
had
done
for
many
years
.
The
local
Istiqlal
and
U.M.C.I.A.
offices
did
not
campaign
and
lost
heavily
.
The
value
of
the
elections
was
lost
,
both
as
an
experiment
in
increased
political
participation
and
as
a
reliable
indicator
of
commercial
interest
,
as
shown
in
Table
1
.
The
Chamber
of
Commerce
elections
were
,
of
course
,
an
important
event
in
the
preparation
for
rural
commune
elections
.
The
U.N.F.P.
learned
that
its
urban
organization
,
which
depends
heavily
on
U.M.T.
support
,
was
most
effective
.
The
Istiqlal
found
that
the
spontaneous
solidarity
of
the
independence
struggle
was
not
easily
transposed
to
the
more
concrete
,
precise
problems
of
internal
politics
.
The
overall
effect
was
probably
to
stimulate
more
party
activity
in
the
communal
elections
than
might
have
otherwise
taken
place
.
A
second
major
point
of
this
essay
is
to
examine
the
formal
arrangements
for
the
elections
.
Although
a
somewhat
technical
subject
,
it
has
important
political
implications
as
the
above
discussion
of
the
voting
system
indicated
.
Furthermore
,
the
problems
and
solutions
devised
in
the
electoral
experiences
of
the
rapidly
changing
countries
are
often
of
comparative
value
and
essential
to
evaluating
election
results
.
The
sine
qua
non
of
the
elections
was
naturally
an
impartial
and
standardized
procedure
.
As
the
background
discussion
indicated
there
were
frequently
expressed
doubts
that
a
government
dominated
by
either
party
could
fairly
administer
elections
.
The
P.D.I.
and
later
the
Popular
Movement
protected
the
Istiqlal's
``
privileged
position
''
until
the
fall
of
Balafrej
,
and
then
the
Istiqlal
used
the
same
argument
,
which
it
had
previously
ignored
,
against
the
pro-U.N.F.P.
tendencies
of
the
Ibrahim
government
.
The
bulk
of
the
preparation
had
,
of
course
,
proceeded
under
the
supervision
of
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
,
whose
officials
are
barred
from
party
activity
and
probably
generally
disinterested
in
party
politics
.
Apart
from
some
areas
of
recurring
trouble
,
like
Bani
Mellal
,
where
inexperienced
officials
had
been
appointed
,
there
is
little
evidence
that
local
officials
intervened
in
the
electoral
process
.
Centrally
,
however
,
the
administrative
problem
was
more
complex
and
the
sheer
prestige
of
office
was
very
likely
an
unfair
advantage
.
The
King
decided
to
remove
Ibrahim
a
week
before
elections
and
to
institute
a
non-party
Council
of
Government
under
his
personal
direction
.
Although
the
monarch
had
frequently
asserted
that
the
elections
were
to
be
without
party
significance
,
his
action
was
an
implicit
admission
that
party
identifications
were
a
factor
.
The
new
Council
was
itself
inescapably
of
political
meaning
,
which
was
most
clearly
revealed
in
the
absence
of
any
U.N.F.P.
members
and
the
presence
of
several
Istiqlal
leaders
.
Since
the
details
of
the
elections
were
settled
the
change
of
government
had
no
direct
effect
on
the
technical
aspects
of
the
elections
,
and
may
have
been
more
important
as
an
indication
of
royal
displeasure
with
the
U.N.F.P.
.
Voting
preparations
began
in
the
fall
of
1959
,
although
the
actual
demarcation
and
planning
for
the
rural
communes
was
completed
in
1958
.
There
were
three
major
administrative
tasks
:
the
fixing
of
electoral
districts
,
the
registration
of
voters
and
the
registration
of
candidates
.
Voter
registration
began
in
late
November
1959
and
continued
until
early
January
,
1960
.
The
government
was
most
anxious
that
there
be
a
respectable
response
.
Periodic
bulletins
of
the
accomplishment
in
each
province
made
the
registration
process
into
a
kind
of
competition
among
provincial
officials
.
A
goal
was
fixed
,
as
given
in
Table
2
,
and
attention
focused
on
its
fulfillment
.
The
qualifications
to
vote
were
kept
very
simple
.
Both
men
and
women
of
twenty-one
years
of
age
could
register
and
vote
upon
presenting
proof
of
residence
and
identification
.
There
were
liberal
provisions
for
dispensation
where
documents
or
records
were
lacking
.
The
police
were
disqualified
along
with
certain
categories
of
naturalized
citizens
,
criminals
and
those
punished
for
Protectorate
activities
.
The
registration
figures
given
in
Table
2
must
be
interpreted
with
caution
since
the
estimate
for
eligible
electors
were
made
without
the
benefit
of
a
reliable
census
.
Unemployed
older
workers
who
have
no
expectation
of
securing
employment
in
the
occupation
in
which
they
are
skilled
should
be
able
to
secure
counseling
and
retraining
in
an
occupation
with
a
future
.
Some
vocational
training
schools
provide
such
training
,
but
the
current
need
exceeds
the
facilities
.
Current
programs
The
present
Federal
program
of
vocational
education
began
in
1917
with
the
passage
of
the
Smith-Hughes
Act
,
which
provided
a
continuing
annual
appropriation
of
$7
million
to
support
,
on
a
matching
basis
,
state-administered
programs
of
vocational
education
in
agriculture
,
trades
,
industrial
skills
and
home
economics
.
Since
1917
some
thirteen
supplementary
and
related
acts
have
extended
this
Federal
program
.
The
George-Barden
Act
of
1946
raised
the
previous
increases
in
annual
authorizations
to
$29
million
in
addition
to
the
$7
million
under
the
Smith
Act
.
The
Health
Amendment
Act
of
1956
added
$5
million
for
practical
nurse
training
.
The
latest
major
change
in
this
program
was
introduced
by
the
National
Defense
Education
Act
of
1958
,
Title
8
,
of
which
amended
the
George-Barden
Act
.
Annual
authorizations
of
$15
million
were
added
for
area
vocational
education
programs
that
meet
national
defense
needs
for
highly
skilled
technicians
.
The
Federal
program
of
vocational
education
merely
provides
financial
aid
to
encourage
the
establishment
of
vocational
education
programs
in
public
schools
.
The
initiative
,
administration
and
control
remain
primarily
with
the
local
school
districts
.
Even
the
states
remain
primarily
in
an
assisting
role
,
providing
leadership
and
teacher
training
.
Federal
assistance
is
limited
to
half
of
the
total
expenditure
,
and
the
state
or
local
districts
must
pay
at
least
half
.
The
state
may
decide
to
encourage
local
programs
by
paying
half
of
the
cost
,
or
the
state
may
require
the
local
district
to
bear
this
half
or
some
part
of
it
.
Throughout
the
history
of
the
program
,
state
government
expenditures
in
the
aggregate
have
usually
matched
or
exceeded
the
Federal
expenditures
,
while
local
districts
all
together
have
spent
more
than
either
Federal
or
state
governments
.
Today
,
Federal
funds
account
for
only
one-fifth
of
the
nation's
expenditures
for
vocational
education
.
The
greatest
impact
of
the
matching-fund
principle
has
been
in
initially
encouraging
the
poorest
states
and
school
districts
to
spend
enough
to
obtain
their
full
allocation
of
outside
funds
.
National
defense
considerations
have
been
the
major
reason
behind
most
Federal
training
expenditures
in
recent
decades
.
During
World
War
2
,
about
7.5
million
persons
were
enrolled
in
courses
organized
under
two
special
programs
administered
by
state
and
local
school
authorities
:
(
1
)
Vocational
Education
for
National
Defense
,
and
(
2
)
War
Production
Training
.
The
total
cost
of
the
five-year
program
was
$297
million
.
For
the
Smith-Hughes
,
George-Barden
,
and
National
Defense
Act
of
1958
,
the
cumulative
total
of
Federal
expenditures
in
42
years
was
only
about
$740
million
.
No
comparable
measures
are
available
of
enrollments
and
expenditures
for
private
vocational
education
training
.
There
are
a
great
number
and
variety
of
private
commercial
schools
,
trade
schools
and
technical
schools
.
In
addition
,
many
large
corporations
operate
their
own
formal
training
programs
.
A
recent
study
indicated
that
85
per
cent
of
the
nation's
largest
corporations
conducted
educational
programs
involving
some
class
meetings
and
examinations
.
Most
skilled
industrial
workers
,
nevertheless
,
still
acquire
their
skills
outside
of
formal
training
institutions
.
The
National
Manpower
Council
of
Columbia
University
has
estimated
that
three
out
of
five
skilled
workers
and
one
out
of
five
technicians
have
not
been
formally
trained
.
There
is
little
doubt
that
the
students
benefit
from
vocational
education
.
Employers
prefer
to
hire
youth
with
such
training
rather
than
those
without
,
and
most
graduates
of
vocational
training
go
to
work
in
jobs
related
to
their
training
.
Vocational
educators
do
not
claim
that
school
training
alone
makes
skilled
workers
,
but
it
provides
the
essential
groundwork
for
developing
skills
.
In
most
states
,
trade
and
industrial
training
is
provided
in
a
minority
of
the
high
schools
,
usually
located
in
the
larger
cities
.
In
Arkansas
fewer
than
6
per
cent
of
the
high
schools
offer
trade
and
industrial
courses
.
In
Illinois
about
13
per
cent
of
the
schools
have
programs
,
and
in
Pennsylvania
11
per
cent
.
An
important
recent
trend
is
the
development
of
area
vocational
schools
.
For
a
number
of
years
Kentucky
,
Louisiana
and
several
other
states
have
been
building
state-sponsored
vocational
education
schools
that
serve
nearby
school
districts
in
several
counties
.
These
schools
are
intended
to
provide
the
facilities
and
specialized
curriculum
that
would
not
be
possible
for
very
small
school
districts
.
Transportation
may
be
provided
from
nearby
school
districts
.
Courses
are
provided
mainly
for
post
high
school
day
programs
;
;
but
sometimes
arrangements
also
are
made
for
high
school
students
to
attend
,
and
evening
extension
courses
also
may
be
conducted
.
The
Title
8
,
program
of
the
National
Defense
Education
Act
of
1958
was
a
great
spur
to
this
trend
toward
area
schools
.
By
1960
there
were
such
schools
in
all
but
4
states
.
They
were
operating
in
10
of
the
17
major
areas
of
chronic
labor
surplus
and
in
10
of
the
minor
areas
.
An
extension
of
this
program
into
the
other
distressed
areas
should
be
undertaken
.
Relation
to
new
industry
Some
of
this
trend
toward
area
vocational
schools
has
been
related
to
the
problems
of
persistent
labor
surplus
areas
and
their
desire
to
attract
new
industry
.
The
major
training
need
of
a
new
industrial
plant
is
a
short
period
of
pre-employment
training
for
a
large
number
of
semi-skilled
machine
operators
.
A
few
key
skilled
workers
experienced
in
the
company's
type
of
work
usually
must
be
brought
in
with
the
plant
manager
,
or
hired
away
from
a
similar
plant
elsewhere
.
A
prospective
industry
also
may
be
interested
in
the
long-run
advantages
of
training
programs
in
the
area
to
supply
future
skilled
workers
and
provide
supplementary
extension
courses
for
its
employees
.
The
existence
of
a
public
school
vocational
training
program
in
trade
and
industry
provides
a
base
from
which
such
needs
can
be
filled
.
Additional
courses
can
readily
be
added
and
special
cooperative
programs
worked
out
with
any
new
industry
if
the
basic
facilities
,
staff
and
program
are
in
being
.
Thus
,
besides
the
training
provided
to
youth
in
school
,
the
existence
of
the
school
program
can
have
supplementary
benefits
to
industry
which
make
it
an
asset
to
industrial
development
efforts
.
Few
states
make
effective
use
of
their
existing
vocational
education
programs
or
funds
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
new
industry
.
The
opportunity
exists
for
states
to
reserve
some
of
their
vocational
education
funds
to
apply
on
an
ad
hoc
flexible
basis
to
subsidize
any
local
preemployment
training
programs
that
may
be
quickly
set
up
in
a
community
to
aid
a
new
industrial
plant
.
Local
focus
of
programs
The
major
weakness
of
vocational
training
programs
in
labor
surplus
areas
is
their
focus
on
serving
solely
local
job
demands
.
This
weakness
is
not
unique
to
labor
surplus
areas
,
for
it
is
inherent
in
the
system
of
local
school
districts
in
this
country
.
Planning
of
vocational
education
programs
and
courses
is
oriented
to
local
employer
needs
for
trained
workers
.
All
the
manuals
for
setting
up
vocational
courses
stress
the
importance
of
first
making
a
local
survey
of
skill
needs
,
of
estimating
the
growth
of
local
jobs
,
and
of
consulting
with
local
employers
on
the
types
of
courses
and
their
content
.
Furthermore
,
there
is
a
cautious
conservatism
on
the
part
of
those
making
local
skill
surveys
.
Local
jobs
can
be
seen
and
counted
,
while
opportunities
elsewhere
are
regarded
as
more
hypothetical
.
While
the
U.
S.
Department
of
Labor
has
a
program
of
projecting
industry
and
occupational
employment
trends
and
publishing
current
outlook
statements
,
there
is
little
tangible
evidence
that
these
projections
have
been
used
extensively
in
local
curriculum
planning
.
The
U.
S.
Office
of
Education
continues
to
stress
local
surveys
rather
than
national
surveys
.
This
procedure
is
extremely
shortsighted
in
chronic
labor
surplus
areas
with
a
long
history
of
declining
employment
.
Elaborate
studies
have
been
made
in
labor
surplus
areas
in
order
to
identify
sufficient
numbers
of
local
job
vacancies
and
future
replacement
needs
for
certain
skills
to
justify
training
programs
for
those
skills
.
No
effort
is
made
in
the
same
studies
to
present
information
on
regional
or
national
demand
trends
in
these
skills
or
to
consider
whether
regional
or
national
demands
for
other
skills
might
provide
much
better
opportunities
for
the
youth
to
be
trained
.
Moreover
,
the
current
information
on
what
types
of
training
are
needed
and
possible
is
too
limited
and
fragmentary
.
There
simply
is
not
enough
material
available
on
the
types
of
job
skills
that
are
in
demand
and
the
types
of
training
programs
that
are
required
or
most
suitable
.
Much
of
the
available
information
comes
not
from
the
Federal
government
but
from
an
exchange
of
experiences
among
states
.
Proposals
State
and
local
agencies
in
the
vocational
education
field
must
be
encouraged
to
adopt
a
wider
outlook
on
future
job
opportunities
.
There
is
a
need
for
an
expanded
Federal
effort
to
provide
research
and
information
to
help
guide
state
education
departments
and
local
school
boards
in
existing
programs
.
A
related
question
is
whether
unemployed
workers
can
be
motivated
to
take
the
training
provided
.
There
is
little
evidence
that
existing
public
or
private
training
programs
have
any
great
difficulty
getting
students
to
enroll
in
their
programs
,
even
though
they
must
pay
tuition
,
receive
no
subsistence
payments
,
and
are
not
guaranteed
a
job
.
However
,
there
always
is
some
limit
to
the
numbers
who
will
spend
the
time
and
effort
to
acquire
training
.
Again
,
one
major
difficulty
is
the
local
focus
.
A
training
program
in
a
depressed
area
may
have
few
enrollees
unless
there
is
some
apparent
prospect
for
better
employment
opportunities
afterwards
,
and
the
prospect
may
be
poor
if
the
training
is
aimed
solely
at
jobs
in
the
local
community
.
If
there
is
adequate
information
on
job
opportunities
for
skilled
jobs
elsewhere
,
many
more
workers
can
be
expected
to
respond
.
Another
problem
is
who
will
pay
for
the
training
.
Local
school
districts
are
hard
pressed
financially
and
unenthusiastic
about
vocational
training
.
Programs
usually
are
expanded
only
when
outside
funds
are
available
or
local
business
leaders
demand
it
.
Even
industrial
development
leaders
find
it
hard
to
win
local
support
for
training
unless
a
new
industry
is
in
sight
and
requests
it
.
State
governments
have
been
taking
the
lead
in
establishing
area
vocational
schools
,
but
their
focus
is
still
on
area
job
opportunities
.
Only
the
Federal
government
is
likely
to
be
able
to
take
a
long-run
and
nation-wide
view
and
to
pay
for
training
to
meet
national
skilled
manpower
needs
.
If
only
state
funds
were
used
to
pay
for
the
vocational
education
,
it
could
be
argued
that
the
state
should
not
have
to
bear
the
cost
of
vocational
training
which
would
benefit
employers
in
other
states
.
However
,
if
Federal
funds
are
used
,
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
to
train
workers
for
jobs
which
could
be
obtained
elsewhere
as
well
as
for
jobs
in
the
area
of
chronic
unemployment
.
Such
training
would
increase
the
tendency
of
workers
to
leave
the
area
and
find
jobs
in
other
localities
.
A
further
possibility
is
suggested
by
the
example
of
the
G.
I.
bills
and
also
by
some
recent
trends
in
attitudes
toward
improving
college
education
:
that
is
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
individuals
for
vocational
training
when
local
facilities
are
inadequate
.
This
probably
would
require
some
support
for
subsistence
as
well
as
for
tuition
,
but
the
total
would
be
no
greater
than
for
the
proposals
of
unemployment
compensation
or
a
Youth
Conservation
Corps
.
A
maximum
of
$600
per
year
per
student
would
enable
many
to
take
training
away
from
home
.
A
program
of
financial
assistance
would
permit
placing
emphasis
on
the
national
interest
in
training
highly
skilled
labor
.
Instead
of
being
limited
to
the
poor
training
facilities
in
remote
areas
,
the
student
would
be
able
to
move
to
large
institutions
of
concentrated
specialized
training
.
Such
specialized
training
institutions
could
be
located
near
the
most
rapidly
growing
industries
,
where
the
equipment
and
job
experience
exist
and
where
the
future
employment
opportunities
are
located
.
This
would
heighten
possibilities
for
part-time
cooperative
,
on-the-job
and
extension
training
.
Personal
financial
assistance
would
enable
more
emphasis
to
be
placed
on
the
interests
of
the
individual
.
His
aptitudes
and
preferences
could
be
given
more
weight
in
selecting
the
proper
training
.
But
briefly
,
the
topping
configuration
must
be
examined
for
its
inferences
.
Then
the
fact
that
the
lower
channel
line
was
pierced
had
further
forecasting
significance
.
And
then
the
application
of
the
count
rules
to
the
width
(
horizontally
)
of
the
configuration
gives
us
an
intial
estimate
of
the
probable
depth
of
the
decline
.
The
very
idea
of
there
being
``
count
rules
''
implies
that
there
is
some
sort
of
proportion
to
be
expected
between
the
amount
of
congestive
activity
and
the
extent
of
the
breakaway
(
run
up
or
run
down
)
movement
.
This
expectation
is
what
really
``
sold
''
point
and
figure
.
But
there
is
no
positive
and
consistently
demonstrable
relationship
in
the
strictest
sense
.
Experience
will
show
that
only
the
vaguest
generalities
apply
,
and
in
fine
,
these
merely
dwell
upon
a
relationship
between
the
durations
and
intensities
of
events
.
After
all
,
too
much
does
not
happen
too
suddenly
,
nor
does
very
little
take
long
.
The
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
these
two
types
of
charting
,
bar
charting
and
point
and
figure
charting
,
remain
the
subject
of
fairly
good-natured
litigation
among
their
respective
professional
advocates
,
with
both
methods
enjoying
in
common
,
one
irrevocable
merit
.
They
are
both
trend-following
methods
.
Even
if
we
strip
their
respective
claims
to
the
barest
minimum
,
the
``
odds
''
still
favor
them
both
,
for
the
trend
in
effect
is
always
more
likely
to
continue
than
to
reverse
.
Of
course
,
many
more
things
are
charted
besides
prices
.
The
foregoing
have
been
methods
of
charting
prices
,
but
now
let
us
look
at
some
of
the
other
indices
that
are
customarily
charted
,
and
which
are
looked
to
for
their
forecasting
abilities
.
The
quest
for
methods
The
search
for
forecasting
formulae
is
ceaseless
.
Correlations
have
been
worked
up
between
the
loading
of
freight
cars
and
the
course
of
stock
price
.
The
theory
behind
this
is
,
of
course
,
fundamentalist
in
character
.
As
the
number
of
reported
freight
car
loadings
increased
,
this
was
taken
to
indicate
increased
industrial
activity
,
and
consequently
increased
stock
earnings
,
implying
fatter
dividends
,
and
implying
therefore
increased
stock
market
prices
.
We
now
know
that
things
rarely
ever
work
out
in
such
cut-and-dried
fashion
,
and
that
car
loadings
,
while
perhaps
interesting
enough
,
are
nevertheless
not
the
magic
formula
that
will
always
turn
before
stock
prices
turn
.
But
the
quest
for
such
an
index
goes
on
ceaselessly
,
with
all
manner
of
investors
and
speculators
participating
,
ranging
from
the
sedate
institutional
type
virtually
to
the
proverbial
shoe-string
operator
,
all
seeking
doggedly
,
studiously
,
daily
--
and
often
nightly
--
for
the
enchanting
index
that
will
foretell
the
eternal
secret
:
Which
way
will
the
market
move
--
up
or
down
?
?
It
recalls
to
mind
the
quest
of
olden
times
for
the
fountain
of
youth
,
a
quest
heavily
invested
in
,
during
the
days
of
wooden
ships
.
Just
as
heavily
invested
are
the
endeavors
of
multitudes
of
modern
men
who
carry
on
the
quest
for
the
enchanting
index
.
The
quest
offers
careers
.
Much
of
this
goes
on
in
offices
high
up
in
Wall
Street's
lofty
wind-swept
towers
.
There
sit
men
who
make
moving
averages
of
weekly
volume
,
monthly
averages
of
price-earnings
ratios
,
ratios
of
the
number
of
advances
to
the
number
of
declines
,
ratios
of
an
individual
stock's
performance
to
overall
market
performance
,
ratios
of
rising
price
volume
to
falling
price
volume
,
odd-lot
indices
,
and
what
not
.
They
are
concerned
with
all
things
traded
in
,
securities
,
bonds
,
cocao
,
coffee
,
soybeans
,
cotton
,
tin
,
oats
,
etc.
.
And
along
Chicago's
West
Jackson
Boulevard
,
La
Salle
Street
,
and
around
the
Merchandise
Mart
Plaza
there
sit
men
who
chart
crop
reports
,
who
divide
the
number
of
reported
lady-bugs
by
the
number
of
reported
green-bugs
,
and
the
number
of
hogs
by
the
amount
of
corn
.
They
plot
the
open
interest
curves
,
rainfall
curves
,
and
they
even
divide
Democratic
congressmen
by
Republican
congressmen
.
All
these
things
and
countless
more
enter
into
their
calculations
,
and
yet
,
the
enchanting
index
remains
non-forthcoming
.
Not
,
at
any
rate
,
in
the
fuller
sense
of
the
word
.
The
markets
are
far
too
subtle
,
and
the
last
word
in
these
endeavors
will
doubtless
never
be
written
,
for
the
enchanting
index
is
about
as
nebulous
as
the
fountain
of
youth
.
But
whereas
civilized
men
no
longer
pursue
the
fountain
,
they
never
abandoned
their
pursuit
of
the
enchanting
index
.
We
mentioned
odd-lot
indices
a
few
paragraphs
ago
.
In
the
stock
market
,
the
normal
trading
package
is
a
hundred
shares
,
just
as
5,000
bushels
is
the
standard
grain
contract
package
.
A
stock
transaction
for
less
than
a
hundred
shares
is
executed
via
a
special
odd-lot
broker
on
the
floor
of
the
exchange
.
This
results
in
a
separate
record
being
made
,
distinguishing
these
trades
from
the
overall
volume
of
trading
.
According
to
the
theory
underlying
odd-lot
indices
,
the
trader
who
trades
odd
lots
is
most
likely
a
small
trader
,
one
who
can't
afford
to
trade
round
lots
.
Or
,
to
use
the
cynical
phraseology
of
one
odd-lot
index
enthusiast
,
they
represent
a
sampling
of
the
least
sophisticated
echelon
of
traders
.
Falling
most
easily
prey
to
an
adverse
market
movement
,
for
this
rank
of
traders
can
least
afford
to
lose
,
virtually
anything
the
odd-lot
traders
do
,
marketwise
,
is
taken
to
exemplify
the
``
wrong
''
thing
to
do
.
Figures
reporting
the
volume
of
odd-lot
purchases
and
odd-lot
sales
are
released
by
the
stock
exchange
and
carried
in
the
newspapers
.
Odd-lot
index
observers
then
make
graphs
of
the
data
according
to
their
particular
statistical
recipe
.
They
might
,
for
example
,
plot
it
exactly
as
is
,
or
they
might
make
ten
day
moving
averages
of
it
,
or
longer
moving
averages
,
or
they
might
simply
plot
the
ratio
of
odd-lot
purchases
to
odd-lot
sales
.
The
particular
recipe
is
a
matter
of
individual
taste
.
The
data
is
now
interpreted
in
conjunction
with
a
price
chart
,
usually
of
a
popular
stock
average
.
Towards
the
end
of
an
intermediate
or
major
rise
,
while
the
top
is
forming
on
the
price
chart
,
it
is
frequently
observed
that
the
odd-lot
buying
increases
sharply
.
This
warns
the
chartist
that
the
formation
in
progress
is
quite
likely
to
be
a
top
.
Similarly
,
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
market
cycle
,
towards
the
end
of
an
intermediate
or
major
decline
,
usually
while
the
bottom
is
being
formed
on
the
price
chart
,
it
is
characteristic
that
an
increase
is
noticed
in
odd-lot
selling
again
alerting
the
chartist
that
a
bottom
is
becoming
a
greater
likelihood
.
Thus
,
in
the
aggregate
,
the
odd-lot
trader
is
one
who
buys
at
the
tops
and
sells
at
the
bottoms
,
notwithstanding
occasional
individual
exceptions
.
While
it
had
long
been
known
in
general
,
that
``
the
public
is
always
wrong
''
,
the
use
of
odd-lot
indices
now
puts
the
adage
on
a
statistical
basis
.
One
might
well
wonder
why
the
``
public
is
always
wrong
''
and
the
question
raised
is
about
as
awkward
as
the
one
concerned
with
the
chicken
and
the
egg
.
Which
came
first
?
?
Is
it
really
that
the
``
public
''
buys
at
the
tops
,
and
not
that
the
market
tops
out
when
the
``
public
''
buys
?
?
And
the
converse
at
bottoms
.
Does
the
``
public
''
usually
sell
at
bottoms
,
or
does
the
market
usually
bottom
out
when
the
``
public
''
sells
?
?
We
have
been
using
the
word
``
public
''
in
quotation
marks
,
that
is
,
in
its
vernacular
connotation
with
reference
to
the
odd-lot
index
theory
.
Obviously
someone
has
to
sell
in
order
for
someone
to
buy
,
and
vice
versa
.
And
while
all
concerned
are
members
of
the
literal
public
,
somewhat
less
than
all
concerned
,
although
still
a
majority
,
form
the
quotation
marked
``
public
''
.
And
the
public
minus
the
``
public
''
leaves
the
so-called
``
sophisticated
''
element
--
the
element
on
the
other
end
of
the
``
public's
''
transactions
.
This
element
is
often
called
``
strong
hands
''
.
Strong
hands
differ
from
``
weak
hands
''
in
that
their
operations
are
the
primary
movers
.
They
initiate
campaigns
,
so
to
speak
,
even
if
this
initiation
is
diffused
among
them
,
and
their
concerted
action
only
psychologically
organized
.
Strong
hands
act
;
;
weak
hands
react
.
Strong
hands
move
first
;
;
weak
hands
ask
,
What
is
going
on
?
?
When
strong
hands
buy
,
they
are
able
to
buy
more
,
and
they
do
it
even
in
the
face
of
bearish
news
reports
.
They
are
able
to
sit
more
patiently
with
what
they
have
bought
.
Needless
to
say
,
strong
hands
are
not
eager
to
be
joined
by
weak
hands
,
for
this
increases
the
risk
that
they
will
have
to
absorb
what
these
weak
hands
unload
on
the
way
up
,
at
higher
prices
,
during
the
run-up
phase
of
the
campaign
.
Certain
badly
disillusioned
market
critics
are
often
apt
to
feel
that
there
is
something
somehow
unfair
,
dirty
,
or
even
thoroughly
criminal
about
this
interplay
of
competitive
forces
.
But
after
all
,
can
anyone
imagine
a
market
wherein
the
reverse
of
these
things
were
true
?
?
Try
to
imagine
a
market
in
which
only
a
minority
of
traders
would
lose
,
and
the
majority
would
make
consistent
profits
.
How
much
and
how
many
profits
could
a
majority
take
out
of
the
losses
of
a
few
?
?
Moreover
,
the
taunt
concerning
the
``
sophisticated
''
echelon
and
its
alleged
erudition
is
put
to
test
during
every
campaign
,
and
accrues
only
upon
results
;
;
not
before
.
It
quite
often
happens
that
campaigns
go
askew
,
resulting
in
a
most
unflattering
deterioration
of
strong
hands
into
played-out
hands
,
just
as
a
member
of
a
former
campaign's
``
public
''
may
emerge
flatteringly
``
right
''
the
next
time
.
Membership
in
the
echelons
fluctuates
too
.
The
study
of
odd-lot
indices
is
somehow
akin
to
the
spectacle
of
a
man
trying
to
outfox
his
own
shadow
,
what
with
all
observers
trying
to
get
on
the
side
of
the
``
few
''
at
the
same
time
.
The
usefulness
of
this
study
and
of
configuration
analysis
as
well
,
declines
in
direct
proportion
to
the
dissemination
of
its
use
.
It
has
to
,
by
virtue
of
the
very
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
``
few
''
.
Diametric
opposition
must
persist
as
to
the
future
course
of
prices
,
if
there
is
to
persist
a
market
at
all
.
And
the
few
must
win
what
the
many
lose
,
for
the
opposite
arrangement
would
not
support
markets
as
we
know
them
at
all
,
and
is
,
in
fact
,
unimaginable
.
There
need
be
no
squeamishness
about
admitting
this
.
Anyone
still
doubting
that
this
is
the
only
way
markets
can
be
is
invited
to
try
to
imagine
a
market
wherein
the
majority
consistently
wins
what
the
minority
loses
.
Mr.
John
Magee
,
whose
work
has
been
discussed
in
this
chapter
,
was
quoted
in
a
New
Yorker
Magazine
profile
as
saying
:
``
Of
course
,
you
have
to
remember
it's
a
good
thing
for
us
chartists
that
there
aren't
more
of
us
.
If
you
got
too
many
people
investing
by
this
method
,
their
operations
would
begin
to
affect
stock
prices
,
and
thus
throw
the
charts
off
.
The
method
would
become
self-defeating
''
.
Mr.
Alexander
H.
Wheelan's
Study
Helps
In
Point
And
Figure
Technique
tells
the
readers
:
``
We
assure
you
that
the
total
number
of
people
using
this
method
of
market
analysis
is
a
very
small
portion
of
the
sum
total
of
those
operating
in
the
securities
and
commodities
markets
''
.
What
with
traders
trading
for
so
many
different
objectives
,
and
what
with
there
being
so
many
unique
and
individualized
market
theories
and
trading
techniques
in
use
,
and
more
coming
into
use
all
the
time
,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
any
particular
theory
or
technique
could
acquire
enough
``
fans
''
to
invalidate
itself
.
Nevertheless
,
all
theories
and
techniques
lead
but
to
one
of
two
possible
modes
of
expression
,
if
they
lead
to
a
market
committment
at
all
.
In
the
final
analysis
,
then
,
the
user
becomes
either
a
bull
or
a
bear
in
a
given
instance
,
notwithstanding
any
amount
of
forethought
and
calculation
,
however
elaborate
.
Thus
while
his
theory
or
technique
may
not
be
oversubscribed
,
it
is
commonplace
for
bullish
and
bearish
positions
to
become
temporarily
over-subscribed
.
Though
the
methods
of
deciding
may
be
profound
and
diverse
,
the
possible
conclusions
remain
but
two
.
Chapter
6
,
more
methods
the
hoaxes
The
purpose
set
forth
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
was
first
to
introduce
the
reader
to
a
general
background
knowledge
of
the
various
types
and
capabilities
of
the
forecasting
methods
already
in
use
,
so
that
he
might
then
be
in
a
position
to
evaluate
for
himself
the
validity
of
the
rather
astonishing
empirical
correlation
that
is
to
follow
,
and
to
appraise
the
forecast
that
its
interpretation
suggests
for
the
future
of
farm
prices
over
the
years
immediately
ahead
.
In
assessing
the
outlook
for
interest
rates
in
1961
,
the
question
,
as
always
,
is
the
prospect
for
general
business
activity
.
By
and
large
,
what
happens
to
business
as
a
whole
will
govern
the
relationship
between
demand
and
supply
conditions
in
the
capital
markets
and
will
thus
determine
interest
rates
.
Moreover
,
the
trend
of
general
business
activity
in
1961
will
exert
a
decisive
influence
on
fiscal
,
monetary
,
and
other
Federal
policies
which
affect
interest
rates
.
Nineteen-sixty
has
been
a
baffling
year
for
analysts
of
general
business
activity
.
During
much
of
the
year
the
general
level
of
business
activity
has
moved
along
on
a
record-high
plateau
,
but
there
have
been
persistent
signs
of
slack
in
the
economy
.
The
tendency
for
general
business
activity
to
soften
somewhat
is
becoming
more
evident
.
Although
the
pause
in
the
advance
of
general
business
activity
this
year
has
thus
far
been
quite
modest
,
it
is
hard
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
softening
process
will
continue
into
the
first
quarter
of
1961
and
possibly
somewhat
longer
.
It
is
difficult
to
see
any
powerful
sources
of
strength
on
the
horizon
at
this
time
which
would
give
the
economy
a
new
upward
thrust
.
The
rate
of
plant
and
equipment
spending
by
business
and
industry
now
seems
to
be
topping
out
and
facing
some
decline
.
In
earlier
business
cycles
,
when
this
occurred
the
country
usually
experienced
a
sharp
upturn
in
residential
construction
as
mortgage
financing
became
easier
to
obtain
.
At
this
time
,
however
,
there
are
signs
that
increased
availability
of
mortgage
credit
will
not
act
with
the
usual
speed
to
stimulate
a
sharp
rise
in
residential
construction
.
These
signs
are
the
inventories
of
unsold
houses
in
some
areas
of
the
country
and
the
moderate
rise
in
vacancy
rates
for
apartments
(
7.6%
in
September
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
in
a
more
favorable
vein
,
general
business
activity
should
receive
some
stimulus
from
rising
Federal
spending
,
and
the
reduction
in
business
inventories
has
probably
run
a
good
part
of
its
course
.
The
2%
increase
in
retail
sales
in
October
to
a
4-month
high
is
encouraging
in
this
connection
as
well
as
the
most
recent
consumer
survey
by
the
National
Industrial
Conference
Board
,
which
shows
a
decided
pickup
in
consumer
spending
plans
.
The
pattern
of
general
business
activity
which
probably
lies
ahead
of
us
is
a
further
moderate
softening
through
the
spring
of
1961
before
a
new
rise
in
economic
activity
gets
under
way
.
The
recovery
will
probably
be
sparked
by
a
rising
rate
of
housing
starts
next
spring
in
response
to
more
readily
available
mortgage
credit
,
as
well
as
by
an
expansion
of
Government
spending
,
well
sustained
consumer
spending
,
and
some
rebuilding
of
business
inventories
.
Slight
downward
pressure
What
does
the
general
business
outlook
suggest
about
the
trend
of
long-term
rates
in
1961
?
?
It
suggests
that
during
the
next
several
months
,
through
the
spring
of
1961
,
the
demand
for
long-term
capital
funds
may
be
moderately
lower
and
that
interest
rates
may
tend
to
move
a
little
lower
,
especially
the
rates
on
Federal
,
state
,
and
local
bonds
,
as
well
as
those
on
publicly
offered
corporate
bonds
.
However
,
as
witnessed
by
the
large
corporate
bond
calendar
at
present
,
as
well
as
the
record
amount
of
municipal
bond
issues
approved
by
voters
,
the
over-all
demands
for
capital
funds
seem
likely
to
remain
high
,
so
that
any
downward
pressure
on
rates
from
reduced
demand
should
not
be
great
.
It
seems
likely
,
moreover
,
that
with
an
increase
in
the
rate
of
saving
in
mortgage
lending
institutions
,
interest
rates
on
residential
mortgages
may
move
somewhat
lower
through
the
spring
of
next
year
,
although
the
increased
ease
in
residential
mortgage
lending
may
occur
primarily
in
other
terms
than
interest
rate
,
e.g.
,
easier
downpayment
and
amortization
terms
.
If
the
trend
of
general
business
activity
follows
the
pattern
suggested
here
,
we
are
likely
to
see
additional
steps
by
the
Federal
Reserve
authorities
to
ease
the
availability
of
credit
.
Certainly
a
further
reduction
in
the
discount
rate
would
be
a
strong
possibility
,
as
well
as
an
easier
reserve
position
for
the
banking
system
.
However
,
the
monetary
authorities
will
continue
to
be
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
with
respect
to
our
international
balance
of
payments
position
and
the
outflow
of
gold
,
as
well
as
with
regard
to
avoiding
the
creation
of
excessive
liquidity
in
the
economy
,
which
would
delay
the
effectiveness
of
monetary
policy
measures
in
the
next
expansion
phase
of
the
business
cycle
.
Open
market
policy
One
of
the
most
intriguing
questions
is
whether
the
recent
departures
of
the
Federal
Reserve
authorities
from
confining
their
open
market
operations
to
Treasury
bills
will
spread
into
longer-term
Government
securities
in
the
next
few
months
.
To
the
extent
that
the
new
Administration
has
its
wishes
,
the
Federal
Reserve
would
conduct
its
open
market
operations
throughout
the
entire
maturity
range
of
Government
securities
and
aggressively
seek
to
force
down
long-term
interest
rates
.
The
principle
of
``
bills
only
''
,
or
``
bills
preferably
''
,
seems
so
strongly
accepted
by
the
Federal
Reserve
that
it
is
difficult
to
envision
conditions
which
would
persuade
the
authorities
to
depart
radically
from
it
by
extending
their
open
market
purchases
regularly
into
long-term
Government
securities
.
However
,
to
the
extent
that
the
monetary
authorities
,
in
their
effort
to
ease
credit
in
the
next
several
months
,
conduct
their
open
market
operations
in
longer-term
Government
bonds
,
they
will
certainly
act
to
accentuate
any
tendency
for
long-term
interest
rates
to
ease
as
a
result
of
market
forces
.
By
the
end
of
the
spring
of
1961
,
assuming
that
a
general
business
recovery
gets
under
way
,
interest
rates
should
begin
to
edge
upward
again
,
depending
upon
the
vigor
of
the
recovery
and
the
determination
with
which
the
monetary
authorities
move
to
restrain
credit
availability
.
My
guess
would
be
that
interest
rates
will
decline
moderately
into
the
spring
of
1961
and
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
will
turn
up
gradually
to
recover
the
ground
lost
during
the
downturn
.
It
is
pertinent
to
ask
the
question
:
Has
the
long
upswing
of
interest
rates
during
the
past
15
years
just
about
run
its
course
,
and
are
we
now
entering
a
period
in
which
both
capital
market
forces
and
Federal
policies
will
produce
a
prolonged
decline
of
interest
rates
?
?
My
answer
is
in
the
negative
because
I
believe
that
total
capital
demands
during
the
Sixties
will
continue
to
press
against
available
supplies
,
and
interest
rates
will
generally
tend
to
be
firm
at
high
levels
.
Five
basic
forces
This
view
is
based
upon
several
basic
economic
forces
which
I
believe
will
be
operating
in
the
Sixties
,
as
follows
:
(
1
)
Recent
events
in
the
General
Assembly
of
the
United
Nations
confirm
that
the
cold
war
will
remain
with
us
,
and
probably
intensify
,
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
This
makes
it
certain
that
Federal
expenditures
for
military
preparedness
and
foreign
economic
aid
are
likely
to
rise
further
in
the
next
several
years
.
We
are
just
beginning
the
task
of
trying
to
win
or
maintain
the
friendship
of
the
new
African
nations
against
the
ruthless
competition
of
the
Communist
bloc
.
Our
efforts
to
overcome
the
lead
of
the
Russians
in
space
are
bound
to
mean
accelerated
Federal
spending
.
Moreover
,
it
is
likely
that
Federal
policies
aimed
at
stimulating
a
faster
rate
of
economic
growth
of
the
country
,
to
keep
ahead
of
the
Communist
countries
and
to
demonstrate
that
our
free
economic
system
is
better
than
theirs
,
will
lead
to
rising
Federal
spending
in
certain
areas
such
as
education
,
housing
,
medical
aid
,
and
the
like
.
There
are
serious
dangers
involved
in
this
trend
toward
rising
Federal
expenditures
,
of
which
I
take
a
dim
view
,
but
it
seems
very
likely
to
occur
.
(
2
)
During
the
Sixties
we
have
the
prospect
of
a
significant
stepping
up
in
the
rate
of
household
formations
,
which
should
contribute
to
a
rising
volume
of
consumer
expenditures
and
home
building
.
According
to
the
latest
projections
of
the
Bureau
of
the
Census
,
the
annual
rate
of
household
formations
will
increase
for
the
next
20
years
.
Under
the
most
favorable
assumptions
for
increase
,
the
Bureau
of
the
Census
projects
that
the
annual
rate
of
household
formations
will
rise
from
about
883,000
in
the
last
two
years
of
the
Fifties
to
an
annual
rate
of
about
1,018,000
in
the
first
five
years
of
the
Sixties
,
and
to
a
slightly
higher
annual
rate
of
1,083,000
in
the
second
half
of
the
decade
.
During
the
Seventies
the
projections
show
a
more
pronounced
rise
to
an
annual
rate
of
1,338,000
in
the
second
half
of
that
decade
.
Accordingly
,
the
expanding
markets
for
consumer
goods
and
housing
occasioned
by
the
higher
rate
of
household
formation
should
enhance
the
general
economic
prospects
of
the
Sixties
.
However
,
the
impact
of
a
rising
rate
of
household
formation
this
decade
should
not
be
exaggerated
.
The
average
annual
rate
of
1,083,000
in
the
second
half
of
the
Sixties
is
still
considerably
below
the
annual
rate
of
1,525,000
in
the
three-year
period
from
April
1947
to
March
1950
.
(
3
)
With
the
expansion
of
family
formation
in
the
Sixties
,
a
continued
substantial
rise
in
expenditures
by
state
and
local
government
units
seems
to
be
indicated
.
This
is
an
area
in
which
there
is
still
a
large
backlog
of
demand
.
State
and
local
expenditures
(
in
real
terms
)
increased
persistently
from
$26.5-billion
in
1949
to
$44.3-billion
in
1959
,
and
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
they
showed
a
comparable
increase
in
this
decade
,
which
would
carry
them
to
the
neighborhood
of
$75-billion
by
1970
.
Here
would
be
a
powerful
force
for
raising
business
activity
.
(
4
)
It
seems
likely
that
with
the
three
preceding
forces
at
play
,
the
rate
of
business
and
industrial
plant
and
equipment
expenditures
should
continue
to
move
upward
from
the
levels
of
the
Fifties
.
Spurred
by
keen
competition
in
our
industrial
system
,
and
still
further
increases
in
the
funds
devoted
to
industrial
research
,
plant
and
equipment
expenditures
by
business
and
industry
should
rise
during
the
decade
.
(

)
In
a
more
pessimistic
vein
about
the
economic
outlook
,
I
suspect
that
the
reservoir
of
demand
for
consumer
goods
and
housing
which
was
dammed-up
during
the
Thirties
and
World
War
2
,
is
finally
in
the
process
of
running
dry
.
There
is
some
clear-cut
evidence
of
this
.
For
example
,
the
huge
postwar
demand
on
the
part
of
veterans
for
housing
under
the
VA
home
loan
guaranty
program
seems
to
have
largely
exhausted
itself
.
Indeed
,
the
failure
of
home-building
as
a
whole
to
respond
this
year
to
somewhat
greater
availability
of
mortgage
financing
,
and
the
increasing
reports
of
pockets
of
unsold
homes
and
rising
vacancy
rates
in
apartment
buildings
,
may
also
signal
in
part
that
the
lush
days
of
big
backlog
demand
for
housing
are
reaching
an
end
.
In
a
way
,
we
may
be
witnessing
the
same
thing
in
the
sales
of
automobiles
today
as
the
public
no
longer
is
willing
to
purchase
any
car
coming
on
the
market
but
is
more
insistent
on
compact
cars
free
of
the
frills
which
were
accepted
in
the
Fifties
.
The
huge
backlog
of
demand
which
was
evident
in
the
first
decade
and
a
half
after
the
War
was
fed
by
liquid
assets
accumulated
by
the
public
during
the
War
,
and
even
more
so
by
the
easier
and
easier
credit
in
the
consumer
loan
and
home
loan
fields
.
The
consuming
public
has
used
up
a
good
part
of
these
liquid
assets
,
or
they
have
been
drained
by
the
rising
price
level
,
and
we
have
apparently
gotten
to
the
end
of
the
line
in
making
consumer
or
home
mortgage
terms
easier
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
the
level
of
consumer
expenditures
will
not
continue
to
rise
in
the
Sixties
.
I
am
confident
that
it
will
,
but
consumer
spending
in
the
Sixties
will
not
be
fortified
by
the
great
backlog
of
wants
and
desires
which
characterized
most
of
the
Fifties
.
Markets
should
become
more
competitive
as
consumers
become
more
selective
.
Sixties'
capital
requirements
Accordingly
,
during
the
Sixties
our
national
economy
is
likely
to
grow
at
as
fast
a
rate
as
in
the
Fifties
and
,
in
the
process
,
to
require
enormous
amounts
of
capital
funds
.
Wage-price
policies
of
industry
are
the
result
of
a
complex
of
forces
--
no
single
explanation
has
been
found
which
applies
to
all
cases
.
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
analyze
one
possible
force
which
has
not
been
treated
in
the
literature
,
but
which
we
believe
makes
a
significant
contribution
to
explaining
the
wage-price
behavior
of
a
few
very
important
industries
.
While
there
may
be
several
such
industries
to
which
the
model
of
this
paper
is
applicable
,
the
authors
make
particular
claim
of
relevance
to
the
explanation
of
the
course
of
wages
and
prices
in
the
steel
industry
of
the
United
States
since
World
War
2
.
Indeed
,
the
apparent
stiffening
of
the
industry's
attitude
in
the
recent
steel
strike
has
a
direct
explanation
in
terms
of
the
model
here
presented
.
The
model
of
this
paper
considers
an
industry
which
is
not
characterized
by
vigorous
price
competition
,
but
which
is
so
basic
that
its
wage-price
policies
are
held
in
check
by
continuous
critical
public
scrutiny
.
Where
the
industry's
product
price
has
been
kept
below
the
``
profit-maximizing
''
and
``
entry-limiting
''
prices
due
to
fears
of
public
reaction
,
the
profit
seeking
producers
have
an
interest
in
offering
little
real
resistance
to
wage
demands
.
The
contribution
of
this
paper
is
a
demonstration
of
this
proposition
,
and
an
exploration
of
some
of
its
implications
.
In
order
to
focus
clearly
upon
the
operation
of
this
one
force
,
which
we
may
call
the
effect
of
``
public-limit
pricing
''
on
``
key
''
wage
bargains
,
we
deliberately
simplify
the
model
by
abstracting
from
other
forces
,
such
as
union
power
,
which
may
be
relevant
in
an
actual
situation
.
For
expository
purposes
,
this
is
best
treated
as
a
model
which
spells
out
the
conditions
under
which
an
important
industry
affected
with
the
public
interest
would
find
it
profitable
to
raise
wages
even
in
the
absence
of
union
pressures
for
higher
wages
.
Part
1
,
below
describes
this
abstract
model
by
spelling
out
its
assumptions
.
Part
2
,
discusses
the
operation
of
the
model
and
derives
some
significant
conclusions
.
Part
3
,
discusses
the
empirical
relevance
and
policy
implications
of
the
conclusions
.
Part
4
,
is
a
brief
summary
.
The
Mathematical
Appendix
presents
the
rigorous
argument
,
but
is
best
read
after
Part
1
,
in
order
that
the
assumptions
underlying
the
equations
may
be
explicit
.
1
,
the
assumptions
of
the
model
A
.
The
industry
The
industry
with
which
this
model
is
concerned
is
a
basic
industry
,
producing
a
substantial
share
of
gross
national
product
.
Price
competition
is
lacking
.
For
the
purposes
of
setting
the
product
price
,
the
industry
behaves
as
a
single
entity
.
In
wage
negotiations
,
the
industry
bargains
as
a
unit
with
a
single
union
.
B
.
The
demand
for
the
industry's
product
We
are
concerned
with
aggregate
demand
for
the
industry's
product
.
The
manner
in
which
this
is
shared
among
firms
is
taken
as
given
.
In
any
given
time
period
,
the
aggregate
demand
for
the
industry's
product
is
determined
by
two
things
:
the
price
charged
by
the
industry
,
and
the
level
of
Aj
.
For
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
,
the
problem
of
relative
prices
is
encompassed
in
these
two
variables
,
since
GNP
includes
other
prices
.
(
We
abstract
here
from
technological
progress
and
assume
that
prices
of
all
other
products
change
proportionately
.
)
The
form
of
the
industry
demand
function
is
one
which
makes
quantity
demanded
vary
inversely
with
the
product
price
,
and
vary
directly
with
the
level
of
Aj
.
C
.
Industry
product
price
policy
The
industry
of
this
model
is
so
important
that
its
wage
and
price
policies
are
affected
with
a
public
interest
.
Because
of
its
importance
,
and
because
the
lack
of
price
competition
is
well
recognized
,
the
industry
is
under
considerable
public
pressure
not
to
raise
its
price
any
more
than
could
be
justified
by
cost
increases
.
The
threat
of
effective
anti-trust
action
,
provoked
by
``
gouging
the
public
''
through
price
increases
not
justified
by
cost
increases
,
and
fears
of
endangering
relations
with
customers
,
Congress
,
the
general
public
and
the
press
,
all
operate
to
keep
price
increases
in
some
relation
to
cost
increases
.
For
the
industry
of
this
model
,
the
effect
of
such
public
pressures
in
the
past
has
been
to
hold
the
price
well
below
the
short-run
profit-maximizing
price
(
given
the
wage
rate
and
the
level
of
GNP
)
,
and
even
below
the
entry-limited
price
(
but
not
below
average
cost
)
.
For
such
an
industry
,
it
is
only
``
safe
''
to
raise
its
price
if
such
an
increase
is
manifestly
``
justified
''
by
rising
costs
(
due
to
rising
wages
,
etc.
)
.
Thus
,
if
public
pressure
sets
the
effective
limit
to
the
price
that
the
industry
may
charge
,
this
pressure
is
itself
a
function
of
the
wage
rate
.
In
this
model
,
we
abstract
from
all
non-wage
sources
of
cost
changes
,
so
that
the
``
public-limit
price
''
only
rises
as
the
wage
rate
rises
.
In
such
circumstances
,
it
may
well
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
industry
to
allow
an
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
.
Since
marginal
costs
rise
when
the
wage
rate
rises
,
the
profit-maximizing
price
also
rises
when
the
public-limit
price
is
elevated
,
and
is
likely
to
remain
well
above
the
latter
.
The
entry-limiting
price
will
also
be
raised
for
potential
domestic
competition
,
but
unless
general
inflation
permits
profit
margins
to
increase
proportionately
throughout
the
economy
,
we
might
expect
the
public-limit
price
to
approach
the
entry-limit
price
.
The
foreign-entry-limit
price
would
be
approached
more
rapidly
,
since
domestic
wage-rates
do
not
enter
foreign
costs
directly
.
Where
this
approach
becomes
critical
,
the
industry
can
be
expected
to
put
much
emphasis
on
this
as
evidence
of
its
sincerity
in
``
resisting
''
the
wage
pressures
of
a
powerful
union
,
requesting
tariff
relief
after
it
has
``
reluctantly
''
acceded
to
the
union
pressure
.
Whether
or
not
it
is
in
the
industry's
interest
to
allow
the
basic
wage
rate
to
rise
obviously
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
rises
in
response
to
a
basic
wage
increase
,
and
the
relation
of
this
response
to
the
increase
in
costs
accompanying
the
wage
increase
.
The
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
itself
a
function
of
three
things
:
the
passage
of
time
,
the
level
of
GNP
,
and
the
size
of
the
wage
increase
.
We
are
abstracting
from
the
fact
of
strikes
here
,
but
it
should
be
obvious
that
the
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
also
a
function
of
the
show
of
resistance
put
up
by
the
industry
.
The
industry
may
deliberately
take
a
strike
,
not
to
put
pressure
on
the
union
,
but
in
order
to
``
educate
''
the
government
and
the
customers
of
the
industry
.
As
a
strike
continues
,
these
parties
increase
their
pressure
on
the
industry
to
reach
an
agreement
.
They
become
increasingly
willing
to
accept
the
price
increase
that
the
industry
claims
the
wage
bargain
would
entail
.
Public
indignation
and
resistance
to
wage-price
increases
is
obviously
much
less
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
3%
per
annum
than
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
3%
per
month
.
The
simple
passage
of
an
additional
eleven
months'
time
makes
the
second
3%
boost
more
acceptable
.
Thus
,
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
further
by
a
given
wage
increase
the
longer
it
has
been
since
the
previous
price
increase
.
Notice
,
however
,
that
the
passage
of
time
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
prices
per
se
,
without
an
accompanying
wage
increase
.
Similarly
,
higher
levels
of
GNP
do
not
,
in
themselves
,
provide
grounds
for
raising
prices
,
but
they
do
relax
some
of
the
pressure
on
the
industry
so
that
it
can
raise
prices
higher
for
a
given
wage
increase
.
This
is
not
extended
to
anticipated
levels
of
GNP
,
however
--
only
the
current
level
of
GNP
affects
the
public
pressure
against
wage-price
increases
.
Finally
,
since
the
public
requires
some
restraint
on
the
part
of
the
companies
,
larger
wage
increases
call
for
less
than
proportionately
larger
price
increases
(
e.g.
,
if
a
wage
increase
of
5%
allows
a
price
increase
of
7%
,
a
wage
increase
of
10%
allows
a
price
increase
of
something
less
than
14%
)
.
D
.
Industry
costs
We
assume
that
average
total
unit
cost
in
the
relevant
region
of
operation
is
constant
with
respect
to
quantity
produced
(
the
average
cost
curve
is
horizontal
,
and
therefore
is
identical
with
the
marginal
cost
curve
)
,
and
is
the
same
for
every
firm
(
and
therefore
for
the
industry
)
.
The
level
of
this
average
cost
is
determined
by
factor
prices
,
technology
,
and
so
forth
.
As
we
have
noted
,
however
,
we
are
abstracting
from
changes
in
all
determinants
of
this
level
except
for
changes
in
the
wage
rate
.
The
level
of
average
cost
(
equal
to
marginal
cost
)
is
thus
strictly
a
function
of
the
wage
rate
.
E
.
Union
policies
and
collective
bargaining
issues
The
single
union
which
faces
the
industry
does
not
restrict
its
membership
,
and
there
is
an
adequate
supply
of
labor
available
to
the
firms
of
the
industry
at
the
going
wage
rate
.
The
union
does
not
regard
unemployment
of
its
own
members
as
a
matter
of
concern
when
setting
its
own
wage
policy
--
its
concern
with
employment
makes
itself
felt
in
pressure
upon
the
government
to
maintain
full
employment
.
The
union
vigorously
demands
wage
increases
from
productivity
increases
,
and
wage
increases
to
offset
cost-of-living
increases
,
but
we
abstract
from
these
forces
here
.
For
our
present
purposes
we
assume
that
the
sole
subject
of
bargaining
is
the
basic
wage
rate
(
not
including
productivity
improvement
factors
or
cost-of-living
adjustments
)
,
and
it
is
this
basic
wage
rate
which
determines
the
level
of
costs
.
Productivity
is
something
of
an
amorphous
concept
and
the
amount
of
productivity
increase
in
a
given
time
period
is
not
even
well
known
to
the
industry
,
much
less
to
the
union
or
to
the
public
.
Disagreement
on
the
amount
of
productivity
increase
exacerbates
the
problem
of
agreeing
how
an
increase
in
profit
margins
related
to
a
productivity
increase
should
be
shared
.
The
existence
of
conflict
and
of
vigorous
union
demand
for
an
increase
in
money
wages
does
not
contradict
the
assumption
that
the
union
is
willing
to
settle
for
cost-of-living
and
productivity-share
increases
as
distinct
from
a
cost-raising
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
.
We
assume
further
that
the
union
recognizes
the
possibility
that
price-level
increases
may
offset
wage-rate
increases
,
and
it
does
not
entirely
disregard
the
effect
of
price
increases
arising
from
its
own
wage
increases
upon
the
``
real
''
wage
rate
.
For
internal
political
reasons
,
the
union
asks
for
(
and
accepts
)
increases
in
the
basic
wage
rate
,
and
would
vigorously
oppose
a
reduction
in
this
rate
,
but
the
adjustment
of
the
basic
wage
rate
upwards
is
essentially
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
companies
of
the
industry
.
Changes
in
the
basic
wage
rate
are
cost-raising
,
and
they
constitute
an
argument
for
raising
prices
.
However
,
it
is
not
known
to
either
the
union
or
the
public
precisely
how
much
of
a
cost
increase
is
caused
by
a
given
change
in
the
basic
wage
rate
,
although
the
companies
are
presumed
to
have
reliable
estimates
of
this
magnitude
.
In
this
model
,
then
,
the
industry
is
presumed
to
realize
that
they
could
successfully
resist
a
change
in
the
basic
wage
rate
,
but
since
such
a
change
is
the
only
effective
means
to
raising
prices
they
may
,
in
circumstances
to
be
spelled
out
in
Part
2
,
below
,
find
it
to
their
advantage
to
allow
the
wage
rise
.
Thus
,
for
non-negative
changes
in
the
basic
wage
rate
,
the
industry
becomes
the
active
wage-setter
,
since
any
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
can
occur
only
by
reason
of
industry
acquiescence
.
The
presumption
in
the
literature
would
appear
to
be
that
the
basic
wage
rate
would
be
unchanged
in
this
case
,
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
``
clearly
''
not
in
the
interest
of
the
industry
to
raise
wages
gratuitously
.
From
this
presumption
it
is
an
easy
step
to
the
conclusion
that
any
observed
increases
in
the
basic
wage
rate
must
be
due
to
union
behavior
different
and
more
aggressive
than
assumed
in
our
model
.
It
is
this
conclusion
that
we
challenge
;
;
we
do
so
by
disproving
the
presumption
on
which
it
is
based
.
2
,
the
operation
of
the
model
It
is
convenient
to
assume
that
the
union-industry
contract
is
of
one
year's
duration
.
In
the
century
from
1815
to
1914
the
law
of
nations
became
international
law
.
Several
factors
contributed
to
this
change
.
The
Congress
of
Vienna
is
a
convenient
starting
point
because
it
both
epitomized
and
symbolized
what
was
to
follow
.
Here
in
1815
the
great
nations
assembled
to
legislate
not
merely
for
Europe
,
but
for
the
world
.
Thus
the
Congress
marks
a
formal
recognition
of
the
political
system
that
was
central
to
world
politics
for
a
century
.
International
law
had
to
fit
the
conditions
of
Europe
,
and
nothing
that
could
not
fit
this
system
,
or
the
interests
of
the
great
European
nations
collectively
,
could
possibly
emerge
as
law
in
any
meaningful
sense
.
Essentially
this
imposed
two
conditions
:
First
,
international
law
had
to
recognize
and
be
compatible
with
an
international
political
system
in
which
a
number
of
states
were
competitive
,
suspicious
,
and
opportunistic
in
their
political
alignments
with
one
another
;
;
second
,
it
had
to
be
compatible
with
the
value
system
that
they
shared
.
In
both
respects
,
international
law
was
Europeanized
.
It
was
not
always
easy
to
develop
theory
and
doctrine
which
would
square
the
two
conditions
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
major
European
nations
had
to
maintain
vis-a-vis
each
other
an
emphasis
upon
sovereignty
,
independence
,
formal
equality
--
thus
insuring
for
themselves
individually
an
optimal
freedom
of
action
to
maintain
the
``
flexibility
of
alignment
''
that
the
system
required
and
to
avoid
anything
approaching
a
repetition
of
the
disastrous
Napoleonic
experience
.
But
there
was
no
pressing
need
to
maintain
these
same
standards
with
regard
to
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Thus
,
theory
and
doctrine
applicable
among
the
great
nations
and
the
smaller
European
states
did
not
really
comfortably
fit
less
developed
and
less
powerful
societies
elsewhere
.
Political
interference
in
Africa
and
Asia
and
even
in
Latin
America
(
though
limited
in
Latin
America
by
the
special
interest
of
the
United
States
as
expressed
in
the
Monroe
Doctrine
,
itself
from
the
outset
related
to
European
politics
and
long
dependent
upon
the
``
balance
of
power
''
system
in
Europe
)
was
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
both
common
economic
values
and
the
European
``
balance
''
itself
.
A
nation
such
as
Switzerland
could
be
neutralized
by
agreement
and
could
be
relied
upon
to
protect
its
neutrality
;
;
more
doubtful
,
but
possible
,
(
with
an
assist
from
the
North
)
was
the
neutralization
of
the
Latin
American
countries
;
;
out
of
the
question
was
the
neutralization
of
Asia
and
Africa
.
This
Europeanization
of
the
law
was
made
explicit
by
a
number
of
19th
century
scholars
.
More
emphasis
was
put
upon
the
fact
that
international
law
was
the
law
of
``
civilized
nations
''
;
;
Kent
and
Story
,
the
great
early
American
scholars
,
repeatedly
made
use
of
this
phrase
,
or
of
``
Christian
nations
''
,
which
is
a
substantial
equivalent
.
Wheaton
stated
that
the
public
law
was
essentially
``
limited
to
the
civilized
and
Christian
peoples
of
Europe
or
to
those
of
European
origin
''
.
Of
course
it
had
always
been
of
European
origin
in
fact
,
but
it
had
maintained
a
universal
outlook
under
the
natural
law
theory
.
Now
,
with
virtually
every
writer
,
not
only
was
the
European
origin
of
public
law
acknowledged
as
a
historical
phenomenon
,
but
the
rules
thus
established
by
the
advanced
civilizations
of
Europe
were
to
be
imposed
on
others
.
The
European
customs
on
which
international
law
was
based
were
to
become
,
by
force
and
fiat
,
the
customs
that
others
were
to
accept
as
law
if
they
were
to
join
this
community
as
sovereign
states
.
Hall
,
for
example
,
was
quite
explicit
on
this
point
when
he
said
states
outside
European
civilization
must
formally
enter
into
the
circle
of
law-governed
countries
.
They
must
do
something
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
latter
,
or
some
of
them
,
which
amounts
to
an
acceptance
of
the
law
in
its
entirety
beyond
all
possibility
of
misconstruction
''
.
During
the
nineteenth
century
these
views
were
protested
by
virtually
all
the
Latin
American
writers
,
though
ineffectively
,
just
as
the
new
nations
of
Africa
and
Asia
protest
them
,
with
more
effect
,
today
.
A
number
of
other
nineteenth-century
developments
contributed
to
the
transmutation
of
the
law
of
nations
into
international
law
;
;
that
is
,
from
aspects
of
a
universal
system
of
Justice
into
particular
rules
governing
the
relations
of
sovereign
states
.
The
difference
is
important
,
for
although
the
older
law
of
nations
did
cover
relationships
among
sovereigns
,
this
was
by
no
means
its
exclusive
domain
.
The
law
of
nature
governed
sovereigns
in
their
relationship
to
their
own
citizens
,
to
foreigners
,
and
to
each
other
in
a
conceptually
unified
system
.
The
theory
of
international
law
,
which
in
the
nineteenth
century
became
common
to
virtually
all
writers
in
Europe
and
America
,
broke
this
unity
and
this
universality
.
It
lost
sight
of
the
individual
almost
entirely
and
confined
itself
to
rules
limiting
the
exercise
of
state
power
for
reasons
essentially
unconnected
with
justice
or
morality
save
as
these
values
might
affect
international
relations
.
No
longer
did
the
sovereign
look
to
the
law
of
nations
to
determine
what
he
ought
to
do
;
;
his
search
was
merely
for
rules
that
might
limit
his
freedom
of
action
.
To
appreciate
this
development
,
we
must
relate
it
to
other
aspects
of
nineteenth-century
philosophy
.
First
,
and
most
obvious
,
was
the
growing
nationalism
and
the
tendency
to
regard
the
state
,
and
the
individual's
identification
with
the
state
,
as
transcending
other
ties
of
social
solidarity
.
National
identification
was
not
new
,
but
it
was
accelerating
in
intensity
and
scope
throughout
Europe
as
new
unifications
occurred
.
It
reached
its
ultimate
philosophical
statement
in
notions
of
``
state
will
''
put
forward
by
the
Germans
,
especially
by
Hegel
,
although
political
philosophers
will
recognize
its
origins
in
the
rejected
doctrines
of
Hobbes
.
National
identification
was
reflected
jurisprudentially
in
law
theories
which
incorporated
this
Hegelian
abstraction
and
saw
law
,
domestic
and
international
,
simply
as
its
formal
reflection
.
In
the
international
community
this
reduced
law
to
Jellinek's
auto-limitation
.
A
state
,
the
highest
form
of
human
organization
in
fact
and
theory
,
could
be
subjected
to
Law
only
by
a
manifestation
of
self-will
,
or
consent
.
According
to
the
new
theories
,
the
nineteenth
century
corporate
sovereign
was
``
sovereign
''
in
a
quite
new
and
different
sense
from
his
historical
predecessors
.
He
no
longer
sought
to
find
the
law
;
;
he
made
it
;
;
he
could
be
subjected
to
law
only
because
he
agreed
to
be
.
There
was
no
law
,
domestic
or
international
,
except
that
willed
by
,
acknowledged
by
,
or
consented
to
by
states
.
Hidden
behind
Hegelian
abstractions
were
more
practical
reasons
for
a
changing
jurisprudence
.
Related
to
,
but
distinguishable
from
,
nationalism
was
the
growth
of
democracy
in
one
form
or
another
.
Increased
participation
in
politics
and
the
demands
of
various
groups
for
status
and
recognition
had
dramatic
effects
upon
law
institutions
.
The
efforts
of
various
interest
groups
to
control
or
influence
governmental
decisions
,
particularly
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
impact
of
industralization
,
led
to
a
concentration
of
attention
on
the
legislative
power
and
the
means
whereby
policy
could
be
formulated
and
enforced
as
law
through
bureaucratic
institutions
.
Law
became
a
conscious
process
,
something
more
than
simply
doing
justice
and
looking
to
local
customs
and
a
common
morality
for
applicable
norms
.
Particularly
was
this
true
when
the
norms
previously
applied
were
no
longer
satisfactory
to
many
,
when
customs
were
rapidly
changing
as
the
forces
of
the
new
productivity
were
harnessed
.
The
old
way
of
doing
things
,
which
depended
on
a
relatively
stable
community
with
stable
ideas
dealing
with
familiar
situations
,
was
no
longer
adequate
to
the
task
.
First
was
the
period
of
codification
of
existing
law
:
the
Code
Napoleon
in
France
and
the
peculiar
codification
that
,
in
fact
,
resulted
from
Austin's
restatement
and
ordering
of
the
Common
Law
in
England
.
Codification
was
followed
in
all
countries
by
a
growing
amount
of
legislation
,
some
changing
and
adjusting
the
older
law
,
much
dealing
with
entirely
new
situations
.
The
legislative
mills
have
been
grinding
ever
since
,
and
when
its
cumbersome
processes
were
no
longer
adequate
to
the
task
,
a
limited
legislative
authority
was
delegated
in
one
form
or
another
,
to
the
executive
.
Whereas
the
eighteenth
century
had
been
a
time
in
which
man
sought
justice
,
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
have
been
centuries
in
which
men
are
satisfied
with
law
.
Indeed
,
with
developed
positivism
,
the
separation
of
law
from
justice
,
or
from
morality
generally
,
became
quite
specific
.
In
municipal
systems
we
tend
to
view
what
is
called
positivism
as
fundamentally
a
movement
to
democratize
policy
by
increasing
the
power
of
parliament
--
the
elected
representatives
--
at
the
expense
of
the
more
conservative
judiciary
.
When
the
power
of
the
latter
was
made
both
limited
and
explicit
--
when
norms
were
clarified
and
made
more
precise
and
the
creation
of
new
norms
was
placed
exclusively
in
parliamentary
hands
--
two
purposes
were
served
:
Government
was
made
subservient
to
an
institutionalized
popular
will
,
and
law
became
a
rational
system
for
implementing
that
will
,
for
serving
conscious
goals
,
for
embodying
the
``
public
policy
''
.
It
is
true
that
,
initially
,
the
task
was
to
remove
restrictions
that
,
it
was
thought
,
inhibited
the
free
flow
of
money
,
goods
,
and
labor
;
;
but
even
laissez-faire
was
a
conscious
policy
.
Law
was
seen
as
an
emanation
of
the
``
sovereign
will
''
.
However
,
the
sovereign
was
not
Hobbes'
absolute
monarch
but
rather
the
parliamentary
sovereign
of
Austin
.
It
was
,
too
,
an
optimistic
philosophy
,
and
,
though
it
separated
law
from
morality
,
it
was
by
no
means
an
immoral
or
amoral
one
.
Man
,
through
democratic
institutions
of
government
and
economic
freedom
,
was
master
of
his
destiny
.
The
theory
did
not
require
,
though
it
unfortunately
might
acquire
,
a
Hegelian
mystique
.
It
was
merely
a
rationalization
and
ordering
of
new
institutions
of
popular
government
.
It
was
not
opposed
to
either
justice
or
morality
;
;
it
merely
wished
to
minimize
subjective
views
of
officials
who
wielded
public
authority
.
Particularly
was
this
true
as
laissez-faire
capitalism
became
the
dominant
credo
of
Western
society
.
To
free
the
factors
of
production
was
a
major
objective
of
the
rising
bourgeoisie
,
and
this
objective
required
that
governmental
authority
--
administrative
officials
and
judges
--
be
limited
as
precisely
and
explicitly
as
possible
;
;
that
old
customs
which
inhibited
trade
be
abrogated
;
;
that
business
be
free
from
governmental
supervision
and
notions
of
morality
which
might
clog
the
automatic
adjustments
of
the
free
market
;
;
that
obligations
of
status
that
were
inconsistent
with
the
new
politics
and
the
new
economics
be
done
away
with
.
Contract
--
conceived
as
the
free
bargain
of
formal
equals
--
replaced
the
implied
obligations
of
a
more
static
and
status-conscious
society
.
Indeed
,
contract
was
the
dominant
legal
theme
of
the
century
,
the
touchstone
of
the
free
society
.
Government
itself
was
based
upon
contract
;
;
business
organization
--
the
corporation
--
was
analyzed
in
contractual
terms
;
;
trade
was
based
on
freedom
of
contract
,
and
money
was
lent
and
borrowed
on
contractual
terms
;
;
even
marriage
and
the
family
was
seen
as
a
contractual
arrangement
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
the
international
obligations
of
states
were
also
viewed
in
terms
of
contract
.
In
fact
,
some
--
Anzilotti
is
the
principle
example
--
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
international
law
could
be
traced
to
the
single
legal
norm
,
Pacta
sunt
Servanda
.
The
displacement
(
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
)
of
the
ethical
jurisprudence
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
by
positivism
reshaped
both
international
law
theory
and
doctrine
.
In
the
first
place
the
new
doctrine
brought
a
formal
separation
of
international
from
municipal
law
,
rejecting
the
earlier
view
that
both
were
parts
of
a
universal
legal
system
.
One
result
was
to
nationalize
much
that
had
been
regarded
as
the
law
of
nations
.
Admiralty
law
,
the
law
merchant
,
and
the
host
of
problems
which
arise
in
private
litigation
because
of
some
contact
with
a
foreign
country
were
all
severed
from
the
older
Law
of
Nations
and
made
dependent
on
the
several
national
laws
.
Private
international
law
(
which
Americans
call
the
``
conflict
of
laws
''
)
was
thus
segregated
from
international
law
proper
,
or
,
as
it
is
often
called
,
public
international
law
.
States
were
free
to
enact
,
within
broad
,
though
(
perhaps
)
determinate
limits
,
their
own
rules
as
to
the
application
of
foreign
law
by
their
courts
,
to
vary
the
law
merchant
,
and
to
enact
legislation
with
regard
to
many
claims
arising
on
the
high
seas
.
The
change
was
not
quite
so
dramatic
as
it
sounds
because
in
fact
common
norms
continued
to
be
invoked
by
municipal
courts
and
were
only
gradually
changed
by
legislation
,
and
then
largely
in
marginal
situations
.
Mr.
Justice
Black
was
one
of
the
minority
that
rested
on
the
Article
1
,
power
.
In
this
view
,
supported
by
only
three
members
of
the
Court
,
a
power
denied
by
the
specific
provisions
of
Article
3
,
was
granted
by
the
generality
of
Article
1
.
If
this
seems
arbitrary
,
its
effect
was
to
treat
citizens
of
the
District
of
Columbia
equally
with
citizens
of
the
states
--
at
the
expense
of
expanding
a
troublesome
jurisdiction
.
Federal
question
jurisdiction
For
almost
a
hundred
years
we
relied
upon
state
courts
(
subject
to
review
by
the
Supreme
Court
)
for
the
protection
of
most
rights
arising
under
national
law
.
Then
in
1875
,
apparently
in
response
to
the
nationalizing
influence
of
the
Civil
War
,
Congress
first
gave
the
lower
federal
courts
general
authority
--
concurrently
with
state
tribunals
--
to
decide
cases
involving
federal-right
questions
.
One
purpose
of
the
change
was
to
attain
sympathetic
enforcement
of
rights
insured
by
the
Civil
War
amendments
against
state
interference
.
Serious
difficulty
arose
with
the
advent
of
Substantive
Due
Process
.
An
amendment
,
presumably
designed
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
newly
freed
slaves
,
became
a
``
laissez-faire
''
limitation
upon
state
economic
policy
.
A
flood
of
federal
lower
court
injunctions
seriously
impeded
the
processes
of
local
government
.
Congress
reacted
with
a
series
of
measures
modifying
in
various
ways
what
it
had
granted
in
1875
.
In
1910
it
required
the
convening
of
a
special
three-judge
court
for
the
issuance
of
certain
injunctions
and
allowed
direct
appeals
to
the
Supreme
Court
.
Such
legislation
was
clarified
and
extended
from
time
to
time
thereafter
.
In
1913
an
abortive
provision
was
made
for
the
stay
of
federal
injunction
proceedings
upon
institution
of
state
court
test
cases
.
The
essential
ineffectiveness
of
these
measures
resulted
in
1934
in
substantial
elimination
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
state
public
utility
rate
orders
.
Three
years
later
similar
restraints
were
imposed
upon
injunctions
against
collection
of
state
taxes
.
This
saved
for
state
adjudication
,
in
the
first
instance
,
the
two
major
areas
where
federal
injunctions
had
been
most
obnoxious
,
but
other
areas
remained
vulnerable
.
Meanwhile
,
the
Supreme
Court
,
like
Congress
,
showed
misgivings
concerning
this
aspect
of
government
by
injunction
.
Drawing
upon
the
traditional
discretion
of
the
chancellor
,
Mr.
Justice
Holmes
introduced
a
series
of
self-imposed
judicial
restraints
that
culminated
in
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter's
famous
doctrine
of
abstention
.
Whereas
the
earlier
cases
turned
rather
narrowly
upon
the
availability
of
adequate
state
remedies
,
the
new
emphasis
is
upon
the
nature
of
the
state
policy
at
issue
.
The
classic
case
is
Railroad
Commission
v.
Pullman
.
The
commission
had
issued
an
administrative
order
which
was
challenged
as
discriminatory
against
Negroes
.
Its
enforcement
was
enjoined
by
a
federal
trial
court
.
On
review
the
Supreme
Court
,
via
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
,
found
southern
racial
problems
``
a
sensitive
area
of
social
policy
on
which
the
federal
courts
ought
not
to
enter
unless
no
alternative
to
adjudication
is
open
''
.
An
alternative
was
found
in
the
vagueness
of
state
law
as
to
whether
the
offending
order
had
in
fact
been
authorized
.
Reluctant
,
as
usual
,
to
interpret
state
legislation
--
such
interpretation
can
only
be
a
``
forecast
rather
than
a
determination
''
--
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
led
a
unanimous
Court
to
vacate
the
injunction
.
But
it
is
crucial
that
here
,
unlike
Burford
,
the
trial
court
was
ordered
to
retain
the
case
until
the
state
courts
had
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
settle
the
state-law
question
.
``
The
resources
of
equity
are
equal
to
an
adjustment
that
will
avoid
the
waste
of
a
tentative
decision
as
well
as
the
friction
of
a
premature
constitutional
adjudication
''
.
Temporary
abstention
,
i.e.
,
postponement
,
is
one
thing
;
;
refusal
to
adjudicate
is
another
.
To
the
extent
that
the
jurisdictional
principle
of
1875
stands
unmodified
by
subsequent
legislation
,
federal
equitable
relief
against
state
action
must
be
available
--
or
so
it
seems
to
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
.
In
Alabama
Public
Service
Commission
v.
Southern
Ry.
Co.
,
the
commission
had
refused
to
permit
abandonment
of
certain
``
uneconomic
''
train
facilities
.
The
railroad
,
claiming
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
,
sought
injunctive
relief
.
The
Court
held
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
not
be
exercised
lest
the
domestic
policy
of
the
state
be
obstructed
;
;
this
in
the
name
of
equitable
discretion
.
Justices
Frankfurter
and
Jackson
concurred
in
the
Court's
result
,
for
they
found
no
merit
in
the
railroad's
claim
.
But
they
objected
vigorously
to
the
proposition
that
federal
courts
may
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
conferred
in
a
valid
act
of
Congress
:
``
By
one
fell
swoop
the
Court
now
finds
that
Congress
indulged
in
needless
legislation
in
the
acts
of
1910
,
1913
,
1925
,
1934
and
1937
.
By
these
measures
,
Congress
,
so
the
Court
(
in
effect
)
now
decides
,
gave
not
only
needless
but
inadequate
relief
,
since
it
now
appears
that
the
federal
courts
have
inherent
power
to
sterilize
the
Act
of
1875
against
all
proceedings
challenging
local
regulation
''
.
A
most
revealing
recent
case
is
Textile
Workers
Union
v.
Lincoln
Mills
.
The
Taft-Hartley
Act
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
``
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
''
.
On
its
face
this
merely
provides
a
federal
forum
;
;
it
does
not
establish
any
law
(
rights
)
for
the
federal
judges
to
enforce
.
How
can
judges
exercise
jurisdiction
to
enforce
national
rights
when
Congress
has
created
none
?
?
The
Court
held
that
Congress
had
intended
the
federal
judiciary
to
``
fashion
''
an
appropriate
law
of
labor-management
contracts
.
In
short
,
congressional
power
to
grant
federal-question
authority
to
federal
courts
is
now
apparently
so
broad
that
Congress
need
not
create
,
or
specify
,
the
right
to
be
enforced
.
The
Lincoln
Mills
decision
authorizes
a
whole
new
body
of
federal
``
common
law
''
which
,
as
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
pointed
out
in
dissent
,
leads
to
one
of
the
following
``
incongruities
''
:
``
(
(
1
)
conflict
in
federal
and
state
court
interpretations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
;
;
(
2
)
displacement
of
state
law
by
federal
law
in
state
courts
in
all
actions
regarding
collective
bargaining
agreements
;
;
or
(
3
)
exclusion
of
state
court
jurisdiction
over
these
matters
''
.
The
Justice's
elaborate
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
in
question
suggests
that
Congress'
purpose
was
merely
to
make
unions
suable
.
With
a
few
exceptions
,
the
lawmakers
seemed
unaware
of
the
technical
problems
of
federal
jurisdiction
involved
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
delegation
of
lawmaking
power
to
judges
.
To
avoid
these
constitutional
difficulties
,
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
was
prepared
to
read
the
Taft-Hartley
provision
as
concerned
with
diversity
,
rather
than
federal
question
,
jurisdiction
.
This
would
satisfy
what
presumably
was
Congress'
major
purpose
--
the
suability
of
unions
.
It
would
also
leave
intact
the
states'
traditional
authority
in
the
realm
of
contract
law
.
(
As
we
have
seen
,
the
Erie
and
York
decisions
require
federal
courts
in
diversity
cases
to
follow
state
decisional
rules
.
)
Here
again
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
could
not
lightly
accept
the
principle
of
wholesale
judicial
legislation
.
If
Congress
wants
to
displace
the
states
from
areas
which
they
have
customarily
occupied
,
let
it
do
so
knowingly
and
explicitly
.
And
let
it
do
its
own
lawmaking
and
not
leave
that
to
federal
judges
.
Does
Lincoln
Mills
suggest
that
if
Congress
granted
jurisdiction
over
interstate
divorce
cases
,
the
federal
courts
would
be
authorized
to
fashion
a
national
law
for
the
dissolution
of
marriages
?
?
There
is
a
common
problem
behind
most
of
these
federal
question
and
diversity
cases
.
Congress
has
not
clearly
defined
the
bounds
between
state
and
federal
court
competence
.
It
has
the
power
to
do
so
but
for
the
most
part
has
left
the
matter
for
solution
by
judges
on
a
case-by-case
basis
.
A
careful
student
has
suggested
that
``
In
any
new
revision
(
of
the
Judicial
Code
)
the
legislators
would
do
well
to
remember
that
the
allocation
of
power
to
the
federal
courts
should
be
limited
to
those
matters
in
which
their
expertise
in
federal
law
might
be
used
,
leaving
to
the
state
judiciaries
the
primary
obligation
of
pronouncing
state
law
''
.
Obviously
,
the
goal
here
proposed
is
the
guiding
principle
in
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter's
opinions
--
to
the
extent
that
Congress
leaves
the
problem
to
judicial
discretion
.
The
same
rule
of
specialization
and
division
of
labor
guides
him
in
the
FELA
certiorari
cases
,
in
the
administrative
law
area
,
and
indeed
in
the
whole
realm
of
judicial
review
.
Mr.
Justice
Black
no
doubt
concurs
in
principle
but
is
more
apt
to
make
exceptions
to
achieve
a
generous
and
``
just
''
result
.
He
will
not
be
``
fooled
by
technicalities
''
.
Federal
review
of
state
decisions
With
few
exceptions
,
Congress
has
not
given
federal
courts
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
rights
arising
under
federal
law
.
To
put
it
differently
,
state
and
federal
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
most
claims
of
federal
right
.
To
insure
uniformity
in
the
meaning
of
national
law
,
however
,
state
interpretations
are
subject
to
Supreme
Court
review
.
It
may
be
noted
,
parenthetically
,
that
to
evade
``
desegregation
''
an
ex-Justice
and
former
southern
governor
has
urged
Congress
to
abolish
this
reviewing
authority
.
The
result
,
of
course
,
would
be
that
federal
law
inevitably
would
mean
different
things
in
different
states
.
It
would
also
probably
mean
different
things
within
the
same
state
--
depending
upon
what
court
(
state
or
federal
)
rendered
decision
.
We
consider
here
only
a
few
of
many
problems
involved
in
this
crucial
federal-state
relationship
.
The
first
is
that
enforcement
of
national
law
in
state
litigation
raises
in
reverse
the
old
diversity
puzzle
of
the
relation
of
procedure
to
substance
.
Subject
to
certain
constitutional
restraints
in
favor
of
fair
trials
,
each
level
of
government
is
free
to
devise
its
own
judicial
procedures
.
Litigants
who
choose
to
assert
federal
claims
in
a
state
court
go
into
that
court
subject
to
its
rules
of
procedure
.
A
similar
canon
applies
to
those
who
press
state
claims
in
federal
tribunals
,
e.g.
,
in
diversity
cases
.
In
an
FELA
controversy
the
state
court
followed
established
state
procedure
by
construing
a
vague
complaint
``
most
strongly
against
''
the
complainant
.
In
other
words
the
burden
of
pleading
clearly
rested
upon
the
pleader
by
state
law
.
The
result
was
that
the
plaintiff's
case
was
dismissed
.
Mr.
Justice
Black
led
a
reversing
majority
:
``
Strict
local
rules
of
pleading
cannot
be
used
to
impose
unnecessary
burdens
upon
rights
of
recovery
authorized
by
federal
law
''
.
Here
,
as
in
the
Byrd
case
,
another
element
of
state
procedure
was
subsumed
to
federal
judge-made
law
.
Justices
Frankfurter
and
Jackson
dissented
:
``
One
State
may
cherish
formalities
more
than
another
,
one
State
may
be
more
responsive
than
another
to
procedural
reforms
.
If
a
litigant
chooses
to
enforce
a
Federal
right
in
a
State
court
,
he
cannot
be
heard
to
object
if
he
is
treated
exactly
as
are
plaintiffs
who
press
like
claims
arising
under
State
law
with
regard
to
the
form
in
which
the
claim
must
be
stated
--
the
particularity
,
for
instance
,
with
which
a
cause
of
action
must
be
described
.
Federal
law
,
though
invoked
in
a
State
court
,
delimits
the
Federal
claim
--
defines
what
gives
a
right
to
recovery
and
what
goes
to
prove
it
.
But
the
form
in
which
the
claim
must
be
stated
need
not
be
different
from
what
the
State
exacts
in
the
enforcement
of
like
obligations
created
by
it
,
so
long
as
a
requirement
does
not
add
to
,
or
diminish
,
the
right
as
defined
by
Federal
law
,
nor
burden
the
realization
of
this
right
in
the
actualities
of
litigation
''
.
Another
problem
in
the
area
of
federal-state
relationships
is
this
:
what
constitutes
reversible
error
in
a
state
decision
?
?
Terminiello
v.
Chicago
involved
a
conviction
for
disorderly
conduct
under
a
local
ordinance
.
The
conduct
in
question
was
a
speech
.
The
accused
did
not
object
to
the
trial
court's
charge
to
the
jury
that
discourse
``
may
constitute
a
breach
of
the
peace
if
it
stirs
the
public
to
anger
,
invites
dispute
,
brings
about
a
condition
of
unrest
.
''
For
present
purposes
it
may
be
assumed
that
this
charge
so
narrowly
limited
speech
as
to
violate
the
federal
Constitution
.
Though
the
accused
raised
many
other
objections
,
he
did
not
object
on
this
crucial
point
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
.
That
is
,
he
did
not
claim
in
any
of
the
four
courts
through
which
his
case
progressed
that
the
jury
charge
had
denied
him
any
federal
right
.
How
else
can
one
explain
,
for
example
,
allowing
the
survival
of
the
right
to
amortize
bond
discount
and
premium
(
section
381(c)(9)
)
,
but
not
the
right
to
amortize
bond
issue
expenses
;
;
or
allowing
a
deduction
for
payment
of
certain
obligations
of
a
transferor
assumed
in
the
reorganization
(
section
381(c)(16)
)
,
but
not
a
deduction
for
theft
losses
sustained
by
a
transferor
prior
to
a
reorganization
but
discovered
after
it
;
;
or
requiring
a
transferor
to
carry
over
its
method
of
depreciation
(
section
381(c)(6)
)
,
but
not
allowing
rapid
amortization
of
emergency
facilities
transferred
in
a
reorganization
;
;
or
allowing
survival
of
a
dividend
carryover
to
a
personal
holding
company
(
section
381(c)(14)
)
,
but
not
carryover
of
excess
tax
credits
for
foreign
taxes
?
?
These
items
,
and
most
of
the
others
listed
above
,
seem
quite
comparable
to
items
whose
right
of
survival
is
provided
for
in
section
381
.
There
does
not
seem
to
be
any
reasonable
basis
for
distinction
either
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
tax
attribute
or
in
terms
of
tax-avoidance
possibilities
.
With
respect
to
items
such
as
these
the
provisions
of
section
381(c)
,
viewed
in
historical
perspective
,
suggest
a
rule
requiring
survival
,
whether
the
items
are
beneficial
or
detrimental
to
the
surviving
corporation
.
To
this
extent
some
stretching
of
the
literal
meaning
of
the
Committee
Report
seems
justified
,
since
the
literal
meaning
conflicts
with
the
clear
implication
,
if
not
the
language
,
of
the
statute
.
It
is
not
contended
that
section
381
should
prescribe
the
survival
of
all
of
the
transferor's
tax
attributes
.
Such
an
interpretation
could
not
be
justified
by
a
construction
of
the
statute
alone
;
;
it
would
certainly
violate
the
intention
of
Congress
as
expressed
in
the
Committee
Report
;
;
and
in
at
least
one
instance
,
involving
refund
claims
,
it
might
be
contrary
to
another
provision
of
the
United
States
Code
.
Refund
claims
Section
203
of
the
United
States
Code
voids
an
assignment
of
a
claim
against
the
Government
unless
made
after
it
has
been
allowed
,
the
amount
due
has
been
ascertained
,
and
a
warrant
for
its
payment
has
been
issued
.
If
it
were
not
for
judicial
development
of
certain
exceptions
,
this
section
would
prohibit
a
suit
for
refund
by
an
acquiring
corporation
for
taxes
paid
by
a
transferor
corporation
,
even
though
the
reorganization
meets
the
requirements
of
section
381(a)
.
A
clearly
recognized
exception
is
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
.
The
leading
case
,
Seaboard
Air
Line
Railway
v.
United
States
,
held
that
the
transferee
could
sue
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
transferor
,
and
it
has
been
consistently
followed
.
The
Court
said
the
purpose
of
the
section
was
principally
to
spare
the
Government
the
embarrassment
and
trouble
of
dealing
with
several
parties
,
one
of
them
a
stranger
to
the
claim
,
and
to
prevent
traffic
in
claims
,
particularly
tenuous
claims
,
against
the
Government
.
Neither
reason
,
said
the
Court
,
applied
to
the
case
at
hand
;
;
furthermore
,
Congress
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended
to
obstruct
mergers
approved
by
the
states
.
Other
exceptions
are
assignments
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
,
corporate
dissolutions
,
transfers
by
descent
,
or
transfers
by
subrogation
.
Exceptions
are
often
classified
as
transfers
by
``
operation
of
law
''
.
A
tax-free
reorganization
not
complying
with
the
merger
or
consolidation
statutes
of
the
states
involved
is
difficult
to
fit
into
an
``
operation
of
law
''
mold
.
Although
it
is
in
some
ways
comparable
to
a
voluntary
sale
of
assets
for
cash
,
to
which
section
203
quite
clearly
applies
,
the
courts
and
Treasury
have
held
that
acquiring
corporations
in
several
types
of
non-taxable
reorganizations
may
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
transferors
.
A
recent
case
in
point
is
Mitchell
Canneries
v.
United
States
,
in
which
a
claim
against
the
Government
was
transferred
first
from
a
corporation
to
a
partnership
,
whose
partners
were
former
stockholders
,
and
then
to
another
corporation
formed
by
the
partners
.
Holding
the
final
corporation
entitled
to
sue
on
the
claim
,
the
Court
cited
the
Seaboard
,
Novo
Trading
,
and
Roomberg
cases
for
the
proposition
that
``
transfers
by
operation
of
law
or
in
conjunction
with
changes
of
corporate
structure
are
not
assignments
prohibited
by
the
statute
''
.
In
an
earlier
case
,
Kingan
&
Co.
v.
United
States
,
an
American
corporation
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
the
stock
of
a
British
corporation
in
exchange
for
its
own
stock
and
then
liquidating
the
British
corporation
.
The
anti-assignment
statute
was
held
not
to
prevent
the
American
corporation
from
suing
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
British
corporation
.
The
transaction
presumably
would
have
qualified
under
section
368(a)(1)
as
a
contractual
reorganization
,
followed
by
a
section
332
liquidation
,
but
not
under
section
368(a)(1)
as
a
statutory
merger
of
consolidation
.
The
Court
,
nevertheless
,
relied
on
the
Seaboard
case
and
also
mentioned
that
the
shareholders
of
the
two
corporations
were
the
same
.
In
substance
,
said
the
Court
,
there
was
no
transfer
of
equitable
title
.
The
Treasury
arrives
at
substantially
the
same
conclusion
,
but
skirts
the
problem
of
section
203
of
the
United
States
Code
.
Revenue
Ruling
54-17
provides
that
if
the
corporation
against
which
a
tax
was
assessed
has
since
been
liquidated
by
merger
with
a
successor
corporation
,
a
claim
for
refund
should
be
filed
by
the
successor
in
the
name
and
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
which
paid
the
tax
,
followed
by
the
name
of
the
successor
corporation
.
Proper
evidence
of
the
liquidation
and
succession
must
also
be
filed
.
If
the
succession
is
a
matter
of
public
record
,
certificates
of
the
Secretaries
of
State
or
other
public
officials
having
custody
of
the
documents
will
suffice
;
;
if
the
succession
is
not
of
record
,
all
documents
relating
to
such
succession
,
properly
certified
,
are
required
.
The
former
proof
seems
applicable
to
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
,
the
latter
to
a
contractual
acquisition
.
The
Ruling
would
not
,
however
,
apply
to
an
acquisition
of
assets
for
cash
.
A
recent
Ruling
,
although
rather
confusing
,
cites
and
follows
Rev.
Rul.
54-17
.
The
Ruling
suggests
also
that
it
applies
to
either
a
statutory
or
contractual
reorganization
.
Hence
,
a
successor
corporation
in
a
C
reorganization
appears
entitled
to
sue
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
merged
corporation
despite
section
203
.
In
a
B
reorganization
,
followed
by
a
section
332
liquidation
,
those
cases
which
hold
that
section
203
is
inapplicable
to
transfers
in
liquidation
appear
to
permit
the
successor
corporation
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
transferor
.
In
fact
,
a
cash
purchase
of
a
corporation's
stock
followed
by
liquidation
might
also
be
an
effective
way
to
transfer
a
claim
for
refund
if
the
Kimbell-Diamond
doctrine
is
not
applied
to
eliminate
the
intermediate
step
.
These
results
appear
sound
.
As
stated
in
Seaboard
and
numerous
other
cases
,
the
two
primary
reasons
for
the
enactment
of
section
203
of
the
United
States
Code
were
to
prevent
the
Government
from
having
to
deal
with
more
than
one
claimant
and
to
prevent
the
assignment
of
meretricious
claims
on
a
contingent-fee
basis
.
The
cases
have
allowed
transfer
of
claims
if
beneficial
ownership
is
not
changed
.
The
first
reason
would
never
apply
to
a
reorganization
transfer
which
meets
the
conditions
of
section
381(a)
,
which
is
the
only
type
presently
under
discussion
.
Section
381(a)
applies
only
to
a
transfer
by
liquidation
of
a
subsidiary
owned
to
the
extent
of
at
least
80
per
cent
,
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
,
an
acquisition
of
substantially
all
a
corporation's
assets
solely
in
exchange
for
voting
stock
,
or
a
change
of
identity
,
form
,
or
place
of
organization
.
In
virtually
every
case
the
transferor
corporation
is
liquidated
,
and
its
former
stockholders
either
own
outright
,
or
have
a
continuing
stock
interest
in
,
the
assets
which
gave
rise
to
the
tax
.
In
these
circumstances
the
possibility
of
multiple
or
conflicting
claims
is
exceedingly
remote
.
Furthermore
,
in
a
C
reorganization
the
continuing
interest
of
stockholders
of
the
corporation
which
paid
the
tax
must
be
greater
than
is
necessary
in
a
statutory
merger
,
to
which
the
statute
is
clearly
inapplicable
.
Nor
is
it
at
all
likely
that
a
``
desperate
''
claim
against
the
Government
will
be
assigned
on
a
contingent-fee
basis
in
the
guise
of
a
tax-free
reorganization
.
If
the
transferor
has
substantial
assets
other
than
the
claim
,
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
no
corporation
would
be
willing
to
acquire
all
of
its
properties
in
the
dim
hope
of
collecting
a
claim
for
refund
of
taxes
.
If
such
an
unlikely
transaction
were
to
take
place
,
it
would
more
logically
be
accomplished
by
a
stock
purchase
,
followed
by
the
prosecution
of
the
claim
by
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
,
followed
by
liquidation
.
In
the
rare
case
where
a
corporation's
only
substantial
asset
,
or
its
most
important
one
,
is
a
claim
for
refund
,
perhaps
its
transfer
should
not
be
permitted
,
whether
the
reorganization
takes
the
form
of
a
statutory
merger
or
of
the
acquisition
of
assets
for
stock
.
It
appears
,
then
,
that
although
the
matter
is
not
dealt
with
in
section
381(c)
,
a
successor
corporation
in
a
reorganization
of
a
type
specified
in
section
381(a)
is
entitled
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
a
transferor
corporation
.
Section
203
of
the
United
States
Code
has
been
interpreted
as
not
applying
to
claims
against
the
Government
transferred
in
tax-free
reorganizations
.
The
successor
corporations
have
been
held
entitled
to
sue
on
such
claims
.
Other
tax
attributes
of
the
transferor
There
are
certain
tax
attributes
of
a
corporation
whose
nature
and
effect
might
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
reorganization
involved
.
For
example
,
property
``
used
in
the
trade
or
business
''
of
a
transferor
corporation
,
as
defined
in
section
1231
,
presumably
would
not
retain
its
special
status
following
a
non-taxable
reorganization
if
it
is
not
so
used
in
the
business
of
the
acquiring
corporation
.
The
parent
of
a
group
filing
consolidated
returns
might
be
treated
as
the
same
corporation
following
a
reorganization
defined
in
section
368(a)(1)
,
but
as
a
different
corporation
for
this
purpose
after
a
tax-free
acquisition
by
another
corporation
which
had
not
,
for
example
,
elected
to
file
consolidated
returns
with
its
own
subsidiaries
.
Similar
considerations
presumably
made
it
difficult
to
prescribe
a
general
rule
where
the
acquired
and
acquiring
corporations
have
different
methods
of
accounting
(
section
381(c)(4)
)
or
depreciation
(
section
381(c)(6)
)
.
Other
sections
of
the
1954
Internal
Revenue
Code
provide
for
survival
of
certain
of
a
transferor's
tax
attributes
following
a
tax-free
reorganization
.
Section
362
requires
carryover
of
the
transferor
corporation's
basis
for
property
transferred
,
and
section
1223
provides
for
tacking
on
the
transferor's
holding
period
for
such
property
to
that
of
the
transferee
.
Section
169
permits
a
person
acquiring
grain-storage
facilities
to
elect
to
continue
amortization
over
a
60-month
period
.
However
,
a
similar
privilege
was
not
specifically
provided
in
section
168
for
a
person
acquiring
emergency
facilities
.
Attributes
similar
to
a
loss
carryover
.
There
may
be
certain
items
which
are
quite
similar
to
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
or
operating
deficit
and
whose
right
to
survive
a
reorganization
should
perhaps
be
subject
to
the
conditions
applicable
to
those
items
.
For
example
,
suppose
another
excess
profits
tax
similar
to
prior
laws
is
enacted
,
providing
for
carryover
of
excess
profits
credits
.
This
carryover
right
has
a
number
of
things
in
common
with
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
.
It
is
an
averaging
device
intended
to
ease
the
tax
burden
of
fluctuating
income
;
;
it
is
a
tax
benefit
which
might
be
of
substantial
value
to
a
corporation
which
expects
to
have
a
high
excess
profits
tax
.
Under
the
1939
Code
this
item
was
permitted
to
survive
a
tax-free
reorganization
in
the
Stanton
Brewery
case
,
but
only
over
the
dissent
of
Judge
Learned
Hand
,
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
the
Sansome
case
,
a
leading
case
requiring
carryover
of
earnings
and
profits
in
a
non-taxable
reorganization
.
Since
this
type
of
item
was
not
in
the
statute
when
section
381
was
enacted
in
1954
,
one
cannot
say
with
certainty
what
effect
the
enactment
of
that
section
should
have
.
With
respect
to
this
type
of
item
,
one
might
properly
apply
the
language
of
the
Committee
Report
,
quoted
above
,
which
cautions
against
using
section
381
as
a
basis
for
treating
other
tax
attributes
not
mentioned
therein
.
Actually
,
there
do
not
presently
appear
to
be
items
in
the
statute
comparable
to
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
.
Probably
the
primary
reason
for
special
treatment
of
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
is
the
unique
opportunity
it
presents
for
tax
avoidance
.

Reasons
for
selecting
mail
questionnaire
method
There
were
two
methods
that
could
have
been
used
for
conducting
the
study
within
the
resources
available
:
(
1
)
interviews
in
depth
with
a
few
selected
companies
,
and
(
2
)
the
more
limited
interrogation
of
a
large
number
of
companies
by
means
of
a
mail
questionnaire
.
While
the
method
of
interviewing
a
small
number
of
companies
was
appealing
because
of
the
opportunity
it
might
have
furnished
to
probe
fully
the
reasons
and
circumstances
of
a
company's
practices
and
opinions
,
it
also
involved
the
risk
of
paying
undue
attention
to
the
unique
and
peculiar
problems
of
just
a
few
individual
companies
.
As
a
result
,
it
was
decided
that
a
mail
questionnaire
sent
to
a
large
number
of
companies
would
be
more
effective
in
determining
the
general
practices
and
opinions
of
small
firms
and
in
highlighting
some
of
the
fundamental
and
recurring
problems
of
defense
procurement
that
concern
both
industry
and
government
.
It
was
also
hoped
that
responses
to
a
mail
questionnaire
would
suggest
fruitful
inquiries
that
might
be
made
in
subsequent
studies
of
a
more
detailed
nature
.
