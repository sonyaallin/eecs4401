Right
now
,
they
are
pushing
a
resolution
which
would
have
UN
use
its
forces
to
invade
and
subjugate
Katanga
.
That
notion
is
fantastically
wrong-headed
from
several
points
of
view
.
The
UN
army
is
too
weak
,
too
demoralized
for
the
task
.
Further
,
it
has
its
work
cut
out
stopping
anarchy
where
it
is
now
garrisoned
.
Last
,
it
makes
no
sense
to
deliver
Katanga
,
the
one
reasonably
solid
territory
,
into
the
existing
chaos
.
The
Congo
should
have
been
mandated
,
because
it
was
not
ready
for
independence
.
The
idea
was
not
even
suggested
because
political
expediency
prevailed
over
wisdom
.
It
is
perhaps
too
late
now
to
talk
of
mandate
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
what
is
termed
political
realism
.
But
if
any
realism
and
feeling
for
truth
remain
in
the
General
Assembly
,
it
is
time
for
men
of
courage
to
measure
the
magnitude
of
the
failure
and
urge
some
new
approach
.
Otherwise
,
UN
will
march
blindly
on
to
certain
defeat
.
Featherbed
reversal
A
recent
editorial
discussing
a
labor-management
agreement
reached
between
the
Southern
Pacific
Co.
and
the
Order
of
Railroad
Telegraphers
has
been
criticized
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
based
on
complete
information
.
The
editorial
was
based
on
a
news
association
dispatch
which
said
that
the
telegraphers
had
secured
an
agreement
whereby
they
were
guaranteed
40
hours'
pay
per
week
whether
they
worked
or
not
and
that
a
reduction
in
their
number
was
limited
to
2
per
cent
per
year
.
Our
comment
was
that
this
was
``
featherbedding
''
in
its
ultimate
form
and
that
sympathy
for
the
railroad
was
misplaced
since
it
had
entered
into
such
an
agreement
.
The
statement
was
also
made
that
undoubtedly
the
railroad
had
received
some
compensating
benefit
from
the
telegraphers
,
but
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
could
balance
a
job
for
life
.
Additional
information
supplied
to
us
discloses
that
the
railroad
gained
a
stabilized
supply
of
telegraphers
of
which
it
was
in
need
.
Also
,
normal
personnel
attrition
would
make
the
job
reduction
provision
more
or
less
academic
.
The
situation
with
regard
to
the
Southern
Pacific
was
therefore
a
special
one
and
not
necessarily
applicable
to
other
situations
in
other
industries
.
The
solution
reached
in
the
agreement
was
more
acceptable
to
the
railroad
than
that
originally
included
in
a
series
of
union
demands
.
