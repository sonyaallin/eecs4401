When
the
early
part
of
the
gradient
was
flattened
,
either
by
using
the
gradient
shown
in
Fig.
2
or
by
allowing
the
``
cone-sphere
''
gradient
to
become
established
more
slowly
,
Region
2
activity
could
sometimes
be
separated
into
two
areas
(
donors
P.
J.
and
R.
S.
,
Fig.
1
and
E.
M.
,
Fig.
2
)
.
The
latter
procedure
gave
rise
to
a
small
active
protein
peak
(
Region
1a
)
between
Regions
1
and
2
.
In
2
of
15
experiments
on
whole
serum
a
region
of
agglutinin
activity
with
intermediate
anionic
binding
capacity
was
detected
(
Region
3
,
Fig.
1
)
.
Moreover
,
after
concentration
using
negative
pressure
dialysis
,
agglutinin
activity
could
sometimes
be
detected
in
the
region
designated
2a
(
donors
P.
J.
,
D.
A.
,
and
J.
F.
,
Fig.
1
)
.
Not
all
these
regions
exhibited
equal
agglutinating
activity
,
as
evidenced
by
titer
and
the
extent
of
the
active
areas
.
In
all
cases
,
most
of
the
activity
lay
in
the
region
of
high
anionic
binding
capacity
.
This
was
particularly
noticeable
in
group
A
and
group
B
sera
,
in
which
cases
activity
in
Regions
1
and
2
was
usually
not
detectable
without
prior
concentration
and
occasionally
could
not
be
detected
at
all
.
There
appeared
to
be
no
difference
in
the
distribution
of
anti-A
and
anti-B
activity
in
group
O
serum
,
though
in
two
group
O
donors
(
J.
F.
and
E.
M.
)
only
one
type
of
agglutinin
was
found
in
the
regions
of
low
anionic
binding
capacity
(
Figs.
1
and
2
)
.
Several
samples
of
citrated
plasma
were
fractionated
in
our
laboratory
by
Method
6
of
Cohn
et
al
.
These
fractions
were
tested
for
ABO
agglutinin
activity
,
using
fractions
from
group
AB
plasma
as
a
control
.
As
expected
,
most
of
the
activity
was
found
in
Fraction
Af
,
with
slight
activity
seen
in
Fraction
4-1
.
A
sample
of
Fraction
Af
from
group
O
plasma
was
dissolved
in
starting
buffer
,
dialyzed
against
this
buffer
and
subjected
to
chromatography
using
the
gradient
shown
in
Fig.
2
.
Once
again
,
both
anti-A
and
anti-B
activities
were
found
in
the
insoluble
material
precipitated
during
dialysis
.
Similarly
,
both
types
of
antibodies
were
found
in
three
regions
of
the
chromatographic
eluate
,
having
extremely
low
,
low
,
and
high
anionic
binding
capacity
,
respectively
(
Fig.
3
)
.
Chromatography
of
whole
sera
revealed
that
the
areas
of
Rh
antibody
activity
were
generally
continuous
and
wide
.
The
incomplete
antibody
activity
appeared
in
the
early
part
of
the
chromatogram
;
;
the
complete
,
in
the
latter
part
.
The
serum
containing
the
mixed
type
of
complete
and
incomplete
antibodies
showed
activity
in
both
regions
(
Fig.
1
)
.
In
all
cases
the
activity
against
Af
cells
was
spread
over
a
wider
area
than
that
with
Af
cells
,
regardless
of
the
type
of
test
(
saline
,
albumin
,
indirect
Coombs
)
used
for
comparison
.
The
insoluble
material
resulting
from
dialysis
against
starting
buffer
always
showed
strong
activity
.
In
fact
agglutination
of
Af
cells
in
saline
could
be
produced
by
the
insoluble
material
from
sera
containing
``
only
''
incomplete
antibody
activity
.
This
was
later
known
to
be
the
result
of
concentrating
the
minute
amount
of
complete
antibody
found
in
these
sera
;
;
when
the
insoluble
fraction
was
suspended
in
a
volume
of
saline
equal
to
that
of
the
original
serum
sample
,
no
complete
antibody
activity
could
be
detected
.
Apart
from
the
honeybee
,
practically
all
bees
and
bumblebees
hibernate
in
a
state
of
torpor
.
Occasionally
,
you
may
come
across
one
or
two
bumblebees
in
the
cold
season
,
when
you
are
turning
over
sods
in
your
garden
,
but
you
have
to
be
a
really
keen
observer
to
see
them
at
all
.
They
keep
their
wings
and
feet
pressed
tightly
against
their
bodies
,
and
in
spite
of
their
often
colorful
attire
you
may
very
well
mistake
them
for
lumps
of
dirt
.
I
must
add
at
once
that
these
animals
are
what
we
call
``
queens
''
,
young
females
that
have
mated
in
the
previous
summer
or
autumn
.
It
is
on
them
alone
that
the
future
of
their
race
depends
,
for
all
their
relatives
(
mothers
,
husbands
,
brothers
,
and
unmated
sisters
)
have
perished
with
the
arrival
of
the
cold
weather
.
Even
some
of
the
queens
will
die
before
the
winter
is
over
,
falling
prey
to
enemies
or
disease
.
The
survivors
emerge
on
some
nice
,
sunny
day
in
March
or
April
,
when
the
temperature
is
close
to
50-degrees
and
there
is
not
too
much
wind
.
Now
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
ourselves
a
couple
of
those
wonderful
flowering
currants
such
as
the
red
Ribes
sanguineum
of
our
Pacific
Northwest
,
or
otherwise
a
good
sloe
tree
,
or
perhaps
some
nice
pussy
willow
in
bloom
,
preferably
one
with
male
or
staminate
catkins
.
The
blooms
of
Ribes
and
of
the
willow
and
sloe
are
the
places
where
large
numbers
of
our
early
insects
will
assemble
:
honeybees
,
bumblebees
,
and
other
wild
bees
,
and
also
various
kinds
of
flies
.
It
is
a
happy
,
buzzing
crowd
.
Each
male
willow
catkin
is
composed
of
a
large
number
of
small
flowers
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
stamens
of
the
catkin
are
always
arranged
in
pairs
,
and
that
each
individual
flower
is
nothing
but
one
such
pair
standing
on
a
green
,
black-tipped
little
scale
.
By
scrutinizing
the
flowers
,
one
can
also
notice
that
the
scale
bears
one
or
two
tiny
warts
.
Those
are
the
nectaries
or
honey
glands
(
Fig.
26
,
page
74
)
.
The
staminate
willow
catkins
,
then
,
provide
their
visitors
with
both
nectar
and
pollen
;
;
a
marvelous
arrangement
,
for
it
provides
exactly
what
the
bee
queens
need
to
make
their
beebread
,
a
combination
of
honey
and
pollen
with
which
the
young
of
all
species
are
fed
.
The
only
exception
to
this
is
certain
bees
that
have
become
parasites
.
I
will
deal
with
these
later
on
.
Quite
often
,
honeybees
form
a
majority
on
the
willow
catkins
.
As
we
have
already
seen
in
the
first
chapter
,
bumblebees
are
bigger
,
hairier
,
and
much
more
colorful
than
honeybees
,
exhibiting
various
combinations
of
black
,
yellow
,
white
and
orange
.
Let
us
not
try
to
key
them
out
at
this
stage
of
the
game
,
and
let
us
just
call
them
Bombus
.
There
must
be
several
dozen
species
in
the
United
States
alone
.
If
you
really
insist
on
knowing
their
names
,
an
excellent
book
on
the
North
American
species
is
Bumblebees
And
Their
Ways
by
O.
E.
Plath
.
If
we
manage
to
keep
track
of
a
Bombus
queen
after
she
has
left
her
feeding
place
,
we
may
discover
the
snug
little
hideout
which
she
has
fixed
up
for
herself
when
she
woke
up
from
her
winter
sleep
.
As
befits
a
queen
,
a
bumblebee
female
is
rather
choosy
and
may
spend
considerable
time
searching
for
a
suitable
nesting
place
.
Most
species
seem
to
prefer
a
ready-made
hollow
such
as
a
deserted
mouse
nest
,
a
bird
house
,
or
the
hole
made
by
a
woodpecker
;
;
some
show
a
definite
liking
for
making
their
nest
in
moss
.
Once
she
has
made
up
her
mind
,
the
queen
starts
out
by
constructing
,
in
her
chosen
abode
,
a
small
``
floor
''
of
dried
grass
or
some
woolly
material
.
On
this
,
she
builds
an
``
egg
compartment
''
or
``
egg
cell
''
which
is
filled
with
that
famous
pollen-and-nectar
mixture
called
beebread
.
She
also
builds
one
or
two
waxen
cups
which
she
fills
with
honey
.
Then
,
a
group
of
eggs
is
deposited
in
a
cavity
in
the
beebread
loaf
and
the
egg
compartment
is
closed
.
The
queen
afterward
keeps
incubating
and
guarding
her
eggs
like
a
mother
hen
,
taking
a
sip
from
time
to
time
from
the
rather
liquid
honey
in
her
honey
pots
.
When
the
larvae
hatch
,
they
feed
on
the
beebread
,
although
they
also
receive
extra
honey
meals
from
their
mother
.
She
continues
to
add
to
the
pollen
supply
as
needed
.
The
larvae
,
kept
warm
by
the
queen
,
are
full
grown
in
about
ten
days
.
Each
now
makes
a
tough
,
papery
cocoon
and
pupates
.
After
another
two
weeks
,
the
first
young
emerge
,
four
to
eight
small
daughters
that
begin
to
play
the
role
of
worker
bees
,
collecting
pollen
and
nectar
in
the
field
and
caring
for
the
new
young
generation
while
the
queen
retires
to
a
life
of
egg
laying
.
The
first
worker
bees
do
not
mate
or
lay
eggs
;
;
males
and
mating
females
do
not
emerge
until
later
in
the
season
.
The
broods
of
workers
that
appear
later
tend
to
be
bigger
than
the
first
ones
,
probably
because
they
are
better
fed
.
By
the
middle
of
the
summer
,
many
of
the
larvae
apparently
receive
such
a
good
diet
that
it
is
``
optimal
''
,
and
it
is
then
that
young
queens
begin
to
appear
.
Simultaneously
,
males
or
drones
are
produced
,
mostly
from
the
unfertilized
eggs
of
workers
,
although
a
few
may
be
produced
by
the
queen
.
The
young
queens
and
drones
leave
the
nest
and
mate
,
and
after
a
short
period
of
freedom
,
the
fertilized
young
queens
will
begin
to
dig
in
for
the
winter
.
It
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in
full
swing
,
for
instance
,
in
August
.
The
temperature
then
is
still
very
high
.
At
the
old
nest
,
the
queen
will
in
the
early
fall
cease
to
lay
the
fertilized
eggs
that
will
produce
females
.
As
a
result
,
the
proportion
of
males
(
which
leave
the
nest
)
increases
,
and
eventually
the
old
colony
will
die
out
completely
.
The
nest
itself
,
the
structure
that
in
some
cases
housed
about
2,000
individuals
when
the
season
was
at
its
peak
,
is
now
rapidly
destroyed
by
the
scavenging
larvae
of
certain
beetles
and
moths
.
Not
always
,
though
,
does
the
development
of
a
bumblebee
colony
take
place
in
the
smooth
fashion
we
have
just
described
.
Some
members
of
the
bee
family
have
become
idlers
,
social
parasites
that
live
at
the
expense
of
their
hardworking
relatives
.
Bumblebees
can
thus
suffer
severely
from
the
onslaughts
of
Psithyrus
,
the
``
cuckoo-bumblebee
''
as
it
is
called
in
some
European
countries
.
Female
individuals
of
Psithyrus
look
deceptively
like
the
workers
and
queens
of
the
bumblebees
they
victimize
.
The
one
sure
way
to
tell
victim
and
villain
apart
is
to
examine
the
hind
legs
which
in
the
case
of
the
idler
,
Psithyrus
,
lack
the
pollen
baskets
--
naturally
!
!
The
female
parasite
spends
much
time
in
her
efforts
to
find
a
nest
of
her
host
.
When
she
succeeds
,
she
usually
manages
to
slip
in
unobtrusively
,
to
deposit
an
egg
on
a
completed
loaf
of
beebread
before
the
bumblebees
seal
the
egg
compartment
.
The
hosts
never
seem
to
recognize
that
something
is
amiss
,
so
that
the
compartment
afterward
is
sealed
normally
.
Thus
,
the
larvae
of
the
intruder
can
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
rightful
inhabitants
and
the
store
of
beebread
.
Later
on
,
they
and
the
mother
Psithyrus
are
fed
by
the
Bombus
workers
.
Worse
still
,
in
a
number
of
cases
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
Psithyrus
female
kills
the
Bombus
queen
.
But
let
us
return
,
after
this
gruesome
interlude
,
to
our
willow
catkins
in
the
spring
;
;
there
are
other
wild
bees
that
command
our
attention
.
It
is
almost
certain
that
some
of
these
,
usually
a
trifle
smaller
than
the
honeybees
,
are
andrenas
or
mining
bees
.
There
are
about
200
different
kinds
of
Andrena
in
Europe
alone
.
One
of
my
favorites
is
A.
armata
,
a
species
very
common
in
England
,
where
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
lawn
bee
.
The
females
like
to
burrow
in
the
short
turf
of
well-kept
lawns
,
where
their
little
mounds
of
earth
often
appear
by
the
hundreds
.
Almost
equal
in
size
to
a
honeybee
,
A.
armata
is
much
more
beautiful
in
color
,
at
least
in
the
female
of
the
species
:
a
rich
,
velvety
,
rusty
red
.
The
males
are
much
duller
.
After
having
mated
,
an
Andrena
female
digs
a
hole
straight
down
into
the
ground
,
forming
a
burrow
about
the
size
of
a
lead
pencil
.
The
bottom
part
of
a
burrow
has
a
number
of
side
tunnels
or
``
cells
''
,
each
of
which
is
provided
with
an
egg
plus
a
store
of
beebread
.
The
development
of
the
Andrena
larvae
is
very
rapid
,
so
that
by
the
end
of
spring
they
have
already
pupated
and
become
adults
.
But
they
are
still
enclosed
in
their
larval
cells
and
remain
there
throughout
the
summer
,
fall
,
and
winter
.
Their
appearance
,
next
spring
,
coincides
in
an
almost
uncanny
way
with
the
flowering
of
their
host
plants
.
In
the
Sacramento
valley
in
California
,
for
instance
,
it
has
been
observed
that
there
was
not
one
day's
difference
between
the
emergence
of
the
andrenas
and
the
opening
of
the
willow
catkins
.
This
must
be
due
to
a
completely
identical
response
to
the
weather
,
in
the
plant
and
the
animal
.
After
the
male
and
female
andrenas
have
mated
,
the
cycle
is
repeated
.
Although
Andrena
is
gregarious
,
so
that
we
may
find
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
burrows
together
,
we
must
still
call
it
a
solitary
bee
.
Its
life
history
is
much
simpler
than
that
of
the
truly
colonial
bumblebees
and
can
serve
as
an
example
of
the
life
cycle
of
many
other
species
.
After
all
,
social
life
in
the
group
of
the
bees
is
by
no
means
general
,
although
it
certainly
is
a
striking
feature
.
On
the
basis
of
its
life
history
,
we
like
to
think
that
Andrena
is
more
primitive
than
the
bumblebees
.
The
way
in
which
it
transports
its
pollen
is
not
so
perfect
,
either
.
It
lacks
pollen
baskets
and
possesses
only
a
large
number
of
long
,
branched
hairs
on
its
legs
,
on
which
the
pollen
grains
will
collect
.
Still
Andrena
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
,
so
that
an
animal
with
a
full
pollen
load
looks
like
a
gay
little
piece
of
yellow
down
floating
in
the
wind
.
Closely
related
to
the
andrenas
are
the
nomias
or
alkali
bees
.
Nomia
melanderi
can
be
found
in
tremendous
numbers
in
certain
parts
of
the
United
States
west
of
the
Great
Plains
,
for
example
,
in
Utah
and
central
Washington
.
In
the
United
States
Department
of
Agriculture's
Yearbook
Of
Agriculture
,
1952
,
which
is
devoted
entirely
to
insects
,
George
E.
Bohart
mentions
a
site
in
Utah
which
was
estimated
to
contain
200,000
nesting
females
.
Often
the
burrows
are
only
an
inch
or
two
apart
,
and
the
bee
cities
cover
several
acres
.
The
life
history
of
the
alkali
bee
is
similar
to
that
of
Andrena
,
but
the
first
activity
of
the
adults
does
not
take
place
until
summer
,
and
the
individuals
hibernate
in
the
prepupal
stage
.
In
most
places
,
there
are
two
generations
a
year
,
a
second
brood
of
adults
appearing
late
in
the
summer
.
I
must
plead
guilty
to
a
special
sympathy
for
nomias
.
This
may
just
be
pride
in
my
adopted
State
of
Washington
,
but
certainly
I
love
to
visit
their
mound
cities
near
Yakima
and
Prosser
in
July
or
August
,
when
the
bees
are
in
their
most
active
period
.
The
name
``
alkali
bee
''
indicates
that
one
has
to
look
for
them
in
rather
inhospitable
places
.
Sometimes
,
although
by
no
means
always
,
these
are
indeed
alkaline
.
The
thing
is
that
these
bees
love
a
fine-grained
soil
that
is
moist
;
;
yet
the
water
in
the
ground
should
not
be
stagnant
either
.
They
dislike
dense
vegetation
.
Where
does
one
find
such
conditions
?
?
The
best
chance
,
of
course
,
is
offered
by
gently
sloping
terrain
where
the
water
remains
close
to
the
surface
and
where
the
air
is
dry
,
so
that
a
high
evaporation
leaves
salty
deposits
which
permit
only
sparse
plant
growth
.
Many
other
(
probably
nearly
all
)
snakes
at
maturity
are
already
more
than
half
their
final
length
.
Laurence
M.
Klauber
put
length
at
maturity
at
two
thirds
the
ultimate
length
for
some
rattlesnakes
,
and
Charles
C.
Carpenter's
data
on
Michigan
garter
and
ribbon
snakes
(
Thamnophis
)
show
that
the
smallest
gravid
females
are
more
than
half
as
long
as
the
biggest
adults
.
Felix
Kopstein
states
that
``
when
the
snake
reaches
its
maturity
it
has
already
reached
about
its
maximal
length
''
,
but
goes
on
to
cite
the
reticulate
python
as
an
exception
,
with
maximum
length
approximately
three
times
that
at
maturity
.
It
is
hard
to
understand
how
he
concluded
that
most
snakes
do
not
grow
appreciably
after
attaining
maturity
;
;
he
was
working
with
species
of
Java
,
so
perhaps
some
tropical
snakes
are
unusual
in
this
respect
.
Certain
individual
giants
recorded
later
did
fail
to
show
a
reasonable
difference
after
maturity
,
but
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
this
is
due
to
captive
conditions
.
Additional
records
of
slow
growth
have
been
omitted
.
It
is
possible
to
make
a
few
generalizations
about
the
six
giants
themselves
.
There
seems
to
be
a
rough
correlation
between
the
initial
and
ultimate
lengths
,
starting
with
the
smallest
(
boa
constrictor
)
and
ending
with
the
largest
(
anaconda
)
.
Data
on
the
former
are
scanty
,
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
latter
is
sometimes
born
at
a
length
greater
than
that
of
any
of
the
others
,
thereby
lending
support
to
the
belief
that
the
anaconda
does
,
indeed
,
attain
the
greatest
length
.
For
four
of
the
six
(
the
anaconda
and
the
amethystine
python
cannot
be
included
for
lack
of
data
)
there
is
also
a
correlation
between
size
at
maturity
and
maximum
length
,
the
boa
constrictor
being
the
smallest
and
the
Indian
python
the
next
in
size
at
the
former
stage
.
Let
us
speculate
a
little
on
the
maximum
size
of
the
anaconda
.
If
,
in
a
certain
part
of
the
range
,
it
starts
life
1
foot
longer
than
do
any
of
the
other
(
relatively
large
)
giants
,
and
reaches
maturity
at
,
let
us
guess
,
18
inches
longer
than
the
others
,
a
quadrupling
of
the
maturity
length
would
result
in
a
maximum
of
(
nearly
)
40
feet
.
When
it
comes
to
rate
of
early
growth
,
the
Indian
python
leads
with
a
figure
of
about
3
feet
6
inches
per
year
for
the
first
two
years
,
more
or
less
.
The
African
rock
python
,
a
close
second
,
is
followed
in
turn
by
the
reticulate
python
.
There
are
few
data
on
the
boa
constrictor
,
those
for
the
anaconda
are
unconvincing
,
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
on
the
amethystine
python
.
It
seems
likely
that
the
Indian
python
comes
out
ahead
because
records
of
its
growth
have
been
made
more
carefully
and
frequently
;
;
it
responds
exceptionally
well
to
captivity
and
does
not
reach
proportions
that
make
it
hard
to
keep
.
I
cannot
make
sense
out
of
the
figures
for
post
maturity
growth
;
;
at
best
the
annual
increase
appears
to
be
a
matter
of
inches
rather
than
feet
.
Until
better
records
have
been
kept
over
longer
periods
of
time
and
much
more
is
known
about
the
maximum
dimensions
,
it
will
be
wise
to
refrain
from
drawing
conclusions
.
It
is
often
stated
that
the
largest
snakes
require
five
years
to
attain
maturity
,
but
this
apparently
is
an
overestimation
.
The
best
way
to
determine
the
correct
figure
(
in
captives
)
is
by
direct
observation
of
pairs
isolated
from
birth
,
a
method
that
produced
surprising
results
:
maturing
of
a
male
Indian
python
in
less
than
two
years
,
his
mate
in
less
than
three
;
;
data
on
the
boa
constrictor
about
match
this
.
Another
approach
is
to
estimate
from
the
rate
of
growth
and
the
smallest
size
at
maturity
.
Results
from
this
approach
amply
confirm
the
direct
observations
:
about
three
years
are
required
,
there
being
a
possible
slight
difference
between
males
and
females
in
the
time
required
.
Only
the
amethystine
python
and
the
anaconda
must
be
excluded
for
lack
or
paucity
of
data
.
The
following
information
on
snakes
varying
greatly
in
size
(
but
all
with
less
than
a
10-foot
maximum
)
shows
,
when
considered
with
the
foregoing
,
that
there
is
probably
no
correlation
between
the
length
of
a
snake
and
the
time
required
for
it
to
mature
.
Oliver
,
in
his
summary
of
the
habits
of
the
snakes
of
the
United
States
,
could
supply
data
on
the
maturing
period
for
only
three
species
in
addition
to
the
rattlers
,
which
I
shall
consider
separately
.
These
three
were
much
alike
:
lined
snake
(
Tropidoclonion
)
,
one
year
and
nine
months
;
;
red-bellied
snake
(
Storeria
)
,
two
years
;
;
cottonmouth
(
Ancistrodon
)
,
two
years
.
Klauber
investigated
the
rattlesnakes
carefully
himself
and
also
summarized
what
others
have
found
.
He
concluded
that
in
the
southern
species
,
which
are
rapidly
growing
types
,
females
mate
at
the
age
of
two
and
a
half
and
bear
the
first
young
when
they
are
three
.
Other
herpetologists
have
ascertained
that
in
the
northern
United
States
the
prairie
rattlesnake
may
not
give
first
birth
until
it
is
four
or
even
five
years
old
,
and
that
the
young
may
be
born
every
other
year
,
rather
than
annually
.
Carpenter's
study
showed
that
female
common
garter
and
ribbon
snakes
of
Michigan
mature
at
about
the
age
of
two
.
Maximum
length
Oversized
monsters
are
never
brought
home
either
alive
or
preserved
,
and
field
measurements
are
obviously
open
to
doubt
because
of
the
universal
tendency
to
exaggerate
dimensions
.
Measurements
of
skins
are
of
little
value
;
;
every
snake
hide
is
noticeably
longer
than
its
carcass
and
intentional
stretching
presents
no
difficulty
to
the
unscrupulous
explorer
.
In
spite
of
all
the
pitfalls
,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
agreement
on
some
of
the
giants
.
The
anaconda
proves
to
be
the
fly
in
the
ointment
,
but
the
reason
for
this
is
not
clear
;
;
the
relatively
wild
conditions
still
found
in
tropical
South
America
might
be
responsible
.
There
are
three
levels
on
which
to
treat
the
subject
.
The
first
is
the
strictly
scientific
,
which
demands
concrete
proof
and
therefore
may
err
on
the
conservative
side
by
waiting
for
evidence
in
the
flesh
.
This
approach
rejects
virtually
all
field
measurements
.
The
next
level
attempts
to
weigh
varied
evidence
and
come
to
a
balanced
,
sensible
conclusion
;
;
field
measurements
by
experienced
explorers
are
not
rejected
,
and
even
reports
of
a
less
scientific
nature
are
duly
evaluated
.
The
third
level
leans
on
a
belief
that
a
lot
of
smoke
means
some
fire
.
The
argument
against
this
last
approach
is
comparable
to
that
which
rejects
stories
about
hoop
snakes
,
about
snakes
that
break
themselves
into
many
pieces
and
join
up
again
,
or
even
of
ghosts
that
chase
people
out
of
graveyards
;
;
the
mere
piling
up
of
testimony
does
not
prove
,
to
the
scientific
mind
,
the
existence
of
hoop
snakes
,
joint
snakes
,
or
ghosts
.
Oliver
has
recently
used
the
second-level
approach
with
the
largest
snakes
,
and
has
come
to
these
conclusions
:
the
anaconda
reaches
a
length
of
at
least
37
feet
,
the
reticulate
python
33
,
the
African
rock
python
25
,
the
amethystine
python
at
least
22
,
the
Indian
python
20
,
and
the
boa
constrictor
18-1/2
.
Bernard
Heuvelmans
also
treats
of
the
largest
snakes
,
but
on
the
third
level
,
and
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
anaconda
.
He
reasons
that
as
anacondas
30
feet
long
are
often
found
,
some
might
be
38
,
and
occasional
``
monstrous
freaks
''
over
50
.
He
rejects
dimensions
of
70
feet
and
more
.
His
thirteenth
chapter
includes
many
exciting
accounts
of
huge
serpents
with
prodigious
strength
,
but
these
seem
to
be
given
to
complete
his
picture
,
not
to
be
believed
.
Detailed
information
on
record
lengths
of
the
giants
is
given
in
the
section
that
follows
.
Growth
of
the
six
giants
Discussions
of
the
giants
one
by
one
will
include
,
as
far
as
possible
,
data
on
these
aspects
of
growth
:
size
at
which
life
is
started
and
at
which
sexual
maturity
is
reached
;
;
time
required
to
reach
maturity
;
;
rate
of
growth
both
before
and
after
this
crucial
stage
;
;
and
maximum
length
,
with
confirmation
or
amplification
of
Oliver's
figures
.
Definite
information
on
the
growth
of
senile
individuals
is
lacking
.
Anaconda
:
At
birth
,
this
species
varies
considerably
in
size
.
A
brood
of
twenty-eight
born
at
Brookfield
Zoo
,
near
Chicago
,
ranged
in
length
from
22
to
33-1/2
inches
and
averaged
29
inches
.
Lawrence
E.
Griffin
gives
measurements
of
nineteen
young
anacondas
,
presumably
members
of
a
brood
,
from
``
South
America
''
;
;
the
extreme
measurements
of
these
fall
between
the
lower
limit
of
the
Brookfield
brood
and
its
average
.
Raymond
L.
Ditmars
had
two
broods
that
averaged
27
inches
.
R.
R.
Mole
and
F.
W.
Urich
give
approximately
20
inches
as
the
average
length
of
a
brood
of
thirty
from
the
region
of
the
Orinoco
estuaries
.
William
Beebe
reports
26
inches
and
2.4
ounces
(
this
snake
must
have
been
emaciated
)
for
the
length
and
the
weight
of
a
young
anaconda
from
British
Guiana
.
In
contrast
,
Ditmars
recorded
the
average
length
of
seventy-two
young
of
a
19-foot
female
as
38
inches
,
and
four
young
were
born
in
London
at
a
length
of
35
or
36
inches
and
a
weight
of
from
14
to
16
ounces
.
Beebe
had
a
3-foot
anaconda
that
weighed
only
9.8
ounces
.
A
difference
between
subspecies
might
explain
the
great
range
in
size
.
I
have
little
information
on
the
anaconda's
rate
of
growth
.
Hans
Schweizer
had
one
that
increased
from
19-1/2
inches
to
5
feet
3
inches
in
five
years
,
and
J.
J.
Quelch
records
a
growth
of
from
less
than
4
feet
to
nearly
10
in
about
six
years
.
It
is
very
unlikely
that
either
of
these
anacondas
was
growing
at
a
normal
rate
.
In
1948
,
Afranio
Do
Amaral
,
the
noted
Brazilian
herpetologist
,
wrote
a
technical
paper
on
the
giant
snakes
.
He
concluded
that
the
anaconda's
maximum
length
is
12
or
13
(
perhaps
14
)
meters
,
which
would
approximate
from
39
to
42
feet
(
14
meters
is
slightly
less
than
46
feet
)
.
Thus
,
his
estimate
lies
between
Oliver's
suggestion
of
at
least
37
feet
and
the
50-foot
``
monstrous
freaks
''
intimated
by
Heuvelmans
.
The
most
convincing
recent
measurement
of
an
anaconda
was
made
in
eastern
Colombia
by
Roberto
Lamon
,
a
petroleum
geologist
of
the
Richmond
Oil
Company
,
and
reported
in
1944
by
Emmett
R.
Dunn
.
However
,
as
a
field
measurement
,
it
is
open
to
question
.
Oliver's
37-1/2
feet
is
partly
based
on
this
report
and
can
be
accepted
as
probable
.
However
,
many
herpetologists
remain
skeptical
and
would
prefer
a
tentative
maximum
of
about
30
feet
.
It
is
possible
that
especially
large
anacondas
will
prove
to
belong
to
subspecies
limited
to
a
small
area
.
In
snakes
difference
in
size
is
a
common
characteristic
of
subspecies
.
Boa
constrictor
:
A
Colombian
female's
brood
of
sixteen
boa
constrictors
born
in
the
Staten
Island
Zoo
averaged
20
inches
.
This
birth
length
seems
to
be
typical
.
When
some
thirteen
records
of
newly
and
recently
born
individuals
are
collated
,
little
or
no
correlation
between
length
and
distribution
can
be
detected
.
The
range
is
from
14
to
25
inches
;
;
the
former
figure
is
based
on
a
somewhat
unusual
birth
of
four
by
a
Central
American
female
(
see
chapter
on
Laying
,
Brooding
,
Hatching
,
and
Birth
)
,
the
latter
on
a
``
normal
''
newly
born
individual
.
However
,
as
so
many
of
the
records
are
not
certainly
based
on
newborn
snakes
,
these
data
must
be
taken
tentatively
;
;
final
conclusions
will
have
to
await
the
measurements
of
broods
from
definite
localities
.
Alphonse
R.
Hoge's
measurements
of
several
very
young
specimens
from
Brazil
suggest
that
at
birth
the
female
is
slightly
larger
than
the
male
.
I
have
surprisingly
little
information
on
the
size
and
age
at
maturity
.
Carl
Kauffeld
has
written
to
me
of
sexual
activity
in
February
1943
of
young
born
in
March
1940
.
One
female
,
collected
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
Nicaragua
,
was
gravid
and
measured
4
feet
8
inches
from
snout
to
vent
(
her
tail
should
be
between
6
and
7
inches
long
)
.
The
female
from
Central
America
which
gave
birth
to
four
was
only
3
feet
11
inches
long
.
What
data
there
are
on
growth
indicate
considerable
variation
in
rate
;
;
unfortunately
,
no
one
has
kept
complete
records
of
one
individual
,
whereas
many
have
been
made
for
a
very
short
period
of
time
.
The
results
are
too
varied
to
allow
generalization
.
The
bronchus
and
pulmonary
artery
in
this
lung
type
maintain
a
close
relationship
throughout
.
The
pulmonary
vein
,
however
,
without
the
limiting
supportive
tissue
septa
as
in
type
1
,
,
follows
a
more
direct
path
to
the
hilum
and
does
not
maintain
this
close
relationship
(
figs.
8
,
22
)
.
Another
marked
difference
is
noted
here
.
The
pulmonary
artery
,
in
addition
to
supplying
the
distal
portion
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
,
the
alveolar
duct
,
and
the
alveoli
,
continues
on
and
directly
supplies
the
thin
pleura
(
fig.
8
)
.
The
bronchial
artery
,
except
for
a
small
number
of
short
branches
in
the
hilum
,
contributes
none
of
the
pleural
blood
supply
.
It
does
,
as
in
type
1
,
,
supply
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
,
the
pulmonary
artery
,
the
pulmonary
vein
,
the
bronchi
,
and
the
bronchioles
--
terminating
in
a
common
capillary
bed
with
the
pulmonary
artery
at
the
level
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
.
No
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
were
noted
in
this
group
.
Lung
type
3
(
(
fig.
3
)
is
to
some
degree
a
composite
of
types
1
,
and
2
.
It
is
characterized
by
the
presence
of
incompletely
developed
secondary
lobules
;
;
well
defined
,
but
haphazardly
arranged
,
interlobular
septa
and
a
thick
,
remarkably
vascular
pleura
(
fig.
9
)
.
The
most
distal
airways
are
similar
to
those
found
in
type
1
,
,
being
composed
of
numerous
,
apparently
true
terminal
bronchioles
and
occasional
,
poorly
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
(
figs.
14
,
15
)
.
In
this
instance
,
because
of
incomplete
septation
,
the
secondary
lobule
does
not
constitute
in
itself
what
appears
to
be
a
small
individual
lung
as
in
type
1
.
Air-drifts
from
one
area
to
another
are
,
therefore
,
conceivable
.
Distally
the
bronchus
is
situated
between
a
pulmonary
artery
on
one
side
and
a
pulmonary
vein
on
the
other
,
as
in
type
1
(
(
fig.
24
)
.
This
relationship
,
however
,
is
not
maintained
centrally
.
Here
the
pulmonary
vein
,
as
in
type
2
,
,
is
noted
to
draw
away
from
the
bronchus
,
and
to
follow
a
more
direct
,
independent
course
to
the
hilum
(
figs.
23
,
24
)
.
The
bronchial
artery
in
its
course
and
distribution
differs
somewhat
from
that
found
in
other
mammals
.
As
seen
in
types
1
,
and
2
,
,
it
supplies
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
,
vasa
vasorum
to
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
,
the
bronchi
and
the
terminal
bronchioles
.
As
in
type
1
,
,
it
provides
arterial
blood
to
the
interlobular
septa
,
and
an
extremely
rich
anastomotic
pleural
supply
is
seen
(
figs.
9
,
10
)
.
This
pleural
supply
is
derived
both
from
hilar
and
interlobular
bronchial
artery
branches
.
Such
a
dual
derivation
was
strikingly
demonstrated
during
the
injection
process
where
initial
filling
would
be
noted
to
occur
in
several
isolated
pleural
vessels
at
once
.
Some
of
these
were
obviously
filling
from
interlobular
branches
of
the
bronchial
arteries
while
others
were
filling
from
direct
hilar
branches
following
along
the
pleural
surface
.
With
completion
of
filling
,
net-like
anastomoses
were
noted
to
be
present
between
these
separately
derived
branches
.
An
unusual
increase
in
the
number
of
bronchial
arteries
present
within
the
substance
of
the
lung
was
noted
.
This
was
accounted
for
primarily
by
the
presence
of
a
bronchial
artery
closely
following
the
pulmonary
artery
.
The
diameter
of
this
bronchial
artery
was
much
too
large
for
it
to
be
a
mere
vasa
vasorum
(
figs.
16
,
23
,
24
)
.
In
distal
regions
its
diameter
would
be
one-fourth
to
one-fifth
that
of
the
pulmonary
artery
.
This
vessel
could
be
followed
to
the
parenchyma
where
it
directly
provided
bronchial
arterial
blood
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
(
figs.
17
,
18
)
.
Also
three
other
direct
pathways
of
alveolar
bronchial
arterial
supply
were
noted
:
via
the
pleura
;
;
through
the
interlobular
septa
;
;
and
along
the
terminal
bronchiole
(
figs.
14
,
17
,
18
,
19
)
.
One
bronchial
arteriolar-pulmonary
arteriolar
anastomosis
was
noted
at
the
terminal
bronchiolar
level
(
fig.
26
)
.
Discussion
It
is
evident
that
many
marked
and
striking
differences
exist
between
lungs
when
an
inter-species
comparison
is
made
.
The
significance
of
these
differences
has
not
been
studied
nor
has
the
existence
of
corresponding
physiologic
differences
been
determined
.
However
,
the
dynamics
of
airflow
,
from
morphologic
considerations
alone
,
may
conceivably
be
different
in
the
monkey
than
in
the
horse
.
The
volume
and
,
perhaps
,
even
the
characteristics
of
bronchial
arterial
blood
flow
might
be
different
in
the
dog
than
in
the
horse
.
Also
,
interlobular
air
drifts
may
be
all
but
nonexistent
in
the
cow
;
;
probably
occur
in
the
horse
much
as
in
the
human
being
;
;
and
,
in
contrast
,
are
present
to
a
relatively
immense
degree
on
a
segmental
basis
in
the
dog
where
lobules
are
absent
(
Van
Allen
and
Lindskog
,
'31
)
.
A
reason
for
such
wide
variation
in
the
pulmonary
morphology
is
entirely
lacking
at
present
.
Within
certain
wide
limits
anatomy
dictates
function
and
,
if
one
is
permitted
to
speculate
,
potential
pathology
should
be
included
in
this
statement
as
well
.
For
example
,
the
marked
susceptibility
of
the
monkey
to
respiratory
infection
might
be
related
to
its
delicate
,
long
alveolar
ducts
and
short
,
large
bronchioles
situated
within
a
parenchyma
entirely
lacking
in
protective
supportive
tissue
barriers
such
as
those
found
in
types
1
,
and
3
.
One
might
also
wonder
if
monkeys
are
capable
of
developing
bronchiolitis
as
we
know
it
in
man
or
the
horse
.
In
addition
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
chronic
generalized
emphysema
occurring
in
a
cow
,
considering
its
marked
lobular
development
but
,
conversely
,
not
difficult
to
imagine
this
occurring
in
the
horse
or
the
dog
.
Anatomically
,
the
horse
lung
appears
to
be
remarkably
like
that
of
man
,
insofar
as
this
can
be
ascertained
from
comparison
of
our
findings
in
the
horse
with
those
of
others
(
Birnbaum
,
'54
)
in
the
human
being
.
The
only
area
in
which
one
might
find
major
disagreement
in
this
matter
is
in
regard
to
the
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
.
As
early
as
1858
,
Le
Fort
claimed
an
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
in
human
beings
.
In
1951
,
this
was
reaffirmed
by
Cudkowicz
.
The
opposition
to
this
point
of
view
has
its
staunchest
support
in
the
work
of
Miller
(
'50
)
.
Apparently
,
however
,
Miller
has
relied
heavily
on
the
anatomy
in
dogs
and
cats
,
and
he
has
been
criticized
for
using
pathologic
human
material
in
his
normal
study
(
Loosli
,
'38
)
.
Although
Miller
noted
in
1907
that
a
difference
in
the
pleural
blood
supply
existed
between
animals
,
nowhere
in
his
published
works
is
it
found
that
he
did
a
comparative
study
of
the
intrapulmonary
features
of
various
mammalian
lungs
other
than
in
the
dog
and
cat
(
Miller
,
'13
;
;
'25
)
.
The
meaning
of
this
variation
in
distribution
of
the
bronchial
artery
as
found
in
the
horse
is
not
clear
.
However
,
this
artery
is
known
to
be
a
nutrient
vessel
with
a
distribution
primarily
to
the
proximal
airways
and
supportive
tissues
of
the
lung
.
The
alveoli
and
respiratory
bronchioles
are
primarily
diffusing
tissues
.
Theoretically
,
they
are
capable
of
extracting
their
required
oxygen
either
from
the
surrounding
air
(
Ghoreyeb
and
Karsner
,
'13
)
or
from
pulmonary
arterial
blood
(
Comroe
,
'58
)
.
Therefore
,
an
explanation
of
this
alveolar
bronchial
artery
supply
might
be
the
nutritive
requirement
of
an
increased
amount
of
supportive
tissue
,
not
primarily
diffusing
in
nature
,
in
the
region
of
the
alveolus
.
If
this
be
true
,
the
possibility
exists
that
an
occlusive
lesion
of
the
bronchial
arteries
might
cause
widespread
degeneration
of
supportive
tissue
similar
to
that
seen
in
generalized
emphysema
.
One
would
not
expect
such
an
event
to
occur
in
animals
possessing
lungs
of
types
1
,
or
2
.
The
presence
of
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
was
first
noted
in
1721
by
Ruysch
,
and
thereafter
by
many
others
.
Nakamura
(
'58
)
,
Verloop
(
'48
)
,
Marchand
,
Gilroy
and
Watson
(
'50
)
,
Von
Hayek
(
'53
)
,
and
Tobin
(
'52
)
have
all
claimed
their
normal
but
relatively
nonfunctional
existence
in
the
human
being
.
Miller
(
'50
)
is
the
principal
antagonist
of
this
viewpoint
.
In
criticism
of
the
latter's
views
,
his
conclusions
were
based
upon
dog
lung
injection
studies
in
which
all
of
the
vascular
channels
were
first
filled
with
a
solution
under
pressure
and
then
were
injected
with
various
sized
colored
particles
designed
to
stop
at
the
arteriolar
level
.
As
early
as
1913
Ghoreyeb
and
Karsner
demonstrated
with
perfusion
studies
in
dogs
that
bronchial
artery
flow
would
remain
constant
at
a
certain
low
level
when
pressure
was
maintained
in
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
,
but
that
increases
in
bronchial
artery
flow
would
occur
in
response
to
a
relative
drop
in
pulmonary
artery
pressure
.
Berry
,
Brailsford
and
Daly
in
1931
and
Nakamura
in
1958
reaffirmed
this
.
Our
own
studies
in
which
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
were
demonstrated
,
were
accomplished
by
injecting
the
bronchial
artery
first
with
no
pressure
on
the
pulmonary
artery
or
vein
,
and
then
by
injecting
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
afterwards
.
It
is
distinctly
possible
,
therefore
,
that
simultaneous
pressures
in
all
three
vessels
would
have
rendered
the
shunts
inoperable
and
hence
,
uninjectable
.
This
viewpoint
is
further
supported
by
Verloop's
(
'48
)
demonstration
of
thickened
bronchial
artery
and
arteriolar
muscular
coats
which
are
capable
of
acting
as
valves
.
In
other
words
,
the
anastomoses
between
the
bronchial
artery
and
pulmonary
artery
should
be
considered
as
functional
or
demand
shunts
.
In
addition
,
little
work
has
been
done
on
a
comparative
basis
in
regard
to
the
normal
existence
of
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
.
Verloop
(
'48
;
;
'49
)
found
these
shunts
in
the
human
being
but
was
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
.
Ellis
,
Grindlay
and
Edwards
(
'52
)
also
were
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
.
Nakamura
(
'58
)
was
unable
to
demonstrate
their
existence
,
either
by
anatomic
or
physiologic
methods
,
in
dogs
.
The
possibility
that
the
absence
or
presence
of
these
shunts
is
species-dependent
is
therefore
inferred
.
Certainly
,
the
mere
fact
of
failing
to
demonstrate
them
in
one
or
another
species
does
not
conclusively
deny
their
existence
in
that
species
.
It
is
,
however
,
highly
suggestive
and
agrees
well
with
our
own
findings
in
which
we
also
failed
to
demonstrate
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
shunts
in
certain
species
,
especially
the
dog
.
In
conclusion
,
these
findings
suggest
the
need
for
a
comparative
physiology
,
pathology
,
and
histology
of
mammalian
lungs
.
In
addition
,
a
detailed
interspecies
survey
of
the
incidence
of
generalized
pulmonary
emphysema
in
mammals
would
be
interesting
and
pertinent
.
Also
,
for
the
present
,
great
caution
should
be
exercised
in
the
choice
of
an
experimental
animal
for
pulmonary
studies
if
they
are
to
be
applied
to
man
.
This
is
especially
so
if
the
dog
,
cat
or
monkey
are
to
be
used
,
in
view
of
their
marked
anatomical
differences
from
man
.
Finally
,
it
is
suggested
that
in
many
respects
the
horse
lung
may
be
anatomically
more
comparable
to
that
of
the
human
than
any
other
presently
known
species
.
Summary
The
main
subgross
anatomical
features
of
the
lungs
of
various
mammals
are
presented
.
A
tabulation
of
these
features
permits
the
lungs
to
be
grouped
into
three
distinctive
subgross
types
.
Type
1
,
is
represented
by
the
cow
,
sheep
,
and
pig
;
;
type
2
,
,
by
the
dog
,
cat
,
and
monkey
;
;
type
3
,
,
by
the
horse
.
Lobularity
is
extremely
well
developed
in
type
1
;
;
absent
in
type
2
;
;
imperfectly
developed
in
type
3
.
The
pleura
and
interlobular
septa
are
thick
in
types
1
and
3
.
The
pleura
is
extremely
thin
in
type
2
and
septa
are
absent
.
Arterial
supply
to
the
pleura
in
types
1
and
3
is
provided
by
the
bronchial
artery
,
and
in
type
2
,
by
the
pulmonary
artery
.
In
types
1
,
2
and
3
the
bronchial
artery
terminates
in
a
capillary
bed
shared
in
common
with
the
pulmonary
artery
at
the
level
of
the
distal
bronchiole
.
In
type
3
the
bronchial
artery
also
provides
blood
directly
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
.
True
terminal
bronchioles
comprise
the
most
frequent
form
taken
by
the
distal
airways
in
types
1
and
3
,
although
small
numbers
of
poorly
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
are
present
.
Well
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
,
on
the
other
hand
,
appear
to
be
the
only
form
taken
by
the
distal
airways
in
type
2
.
In
type
1
the
pulmonary
vein
closely
follows
the
course
of
the
bronchus
and
the
pulmonary
artery
from
the
periphery
to
the
hilum
.
This
may
be
due
to
the
heavy
interlobular
connective
tissue
barriers
present
.
In
type
3
,
this
general
relationship
is
maintained
peripherally
but
not
centrally
where
the
pulmonary
vein
follows
a
more
independent
path
to
the
hilum
as
is
the
case
throughout
the
lung
in
type
2
.
Some
of
the
features
of
the
top
portions
of
Figure
1
and
Figure
2
were
mentioned
in
discussing
Table
1
.
First
,
the
Onset
Profile
spreads
across
approximately
12
years
for
boys
and
10
years
for
girls
.
In
contrast
,
20
of
the
21
lines
in
the
Completion
Profile
(
excluding
center
5
for
boys
and
4
for
girls
)
are
bunched
and
extend
over
a
much
shorter
period
,
approximately
30
months
for
boys
and
40
months
for
girls
.
The
Maturity
Chart
for
each
sex
demonstrates
clearly
that
Onset
is
a
phenomenon
of
infancy
and
early
childhood
whereas
Completion
is
a
phenomenon
of
the
later
portion
of
adolescence
.
Second
,
for
both
sexes
,
the
21
transverse
lines
in
the
Onset
Profile
vary
more
in
individual
spread
than
those
in
the
Completion
Profile
.
Although
the
standard
deviation
values
on
which
spread
of
the
lines
is
based
are
relatively
larger
for
those
centers
which
begin
to
ossify
early
(
Table
1
)
,
there
are
considerable
differences
in
this
value
between
centers
having
the
closely
timed
Onsets
.
Third
,
the
process
of
calcification
is
seen
to
begin
later
and
to
continue
much
longer
for
these
boys
than
for
the
girls
,
a
fact
which
confirms
data
for
other
groups
of
children
.
The
Onset
Profile
and
Completion
Profile
are
constructed
to
serve
as
norms
for
children
.
It
is
convenient
to
classify
a
child's
onset
ages
and
completion
ages
as
``
advanced
''
,
``
moderate
''
(
modal
)
,
or
``
delayed
''
according
to
whether
the
child's
age
equivalent
``
dots
''
appeared
to
the
left
of
,
upon
,
or
to
the
right
of
the
appropriate
short
transverse
line
.
When
a
dot
appears
close
to
the
end
of
the
transverse
line
,
the
``
moderate
''
rating
may
be
further
classified
according
to
the
position
of
the
dot
with
respect
to
the
vertical
marking
denoting
the
mean
age
.
Such
classifications
may
be
called
``
somewhat
advanced
''
or
``
somewhat
delayed
''
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
reserving
``
moderate
''
for
dots
upon
or
close
to
the
mean
.
In
the
lower
portion
of
each
Chart
,
the
Skeletal
Age
(
Hand
)
of
boy
34
and
girl
2
may
be
similarly
classified
.
There
the
middle
one
of
the
three
curves
denotes
``
mean
Skeletal
Age
''
for
the
Maturity
Series
boys
and
girls
.
The
upper
curve
denotes
the
mean
plus
one
standard
deviation
,
and
the
lower
curve
represents
the
mean
minus
one
standard
deviation
.
Thus
,
a
child's
Skeletal
Age
``
dots
''
may
be
classified
as
``
advanced
''
when
they
appear
above
the
middle
curve
,
``
moderate
''
when
they
appear
immediately
above
or
below
the
middle
curve
,
and
``
delayed
''
when
they
appear
below
the
lower
curve
.
To
summarize
the
purpose
of
the
Skeletal
Maturity
Chart
:
each
contains
two
kinds
of
skeletal
maturity
norms
which
show
two
quite
different
methods
of
depicting
developmental
level
of
growth
centers
.
First
,
the
upper
portion
requires
series
of
films
for
every
child
,
consisting
of
those
from
Hand
,
Elbow
,
Shoulder
,
Knee
,
and
Foot
.
The
lower
portion
necessitates
only
films
of
Hand
.
Second
,
the
upper
portion
permits
comparison
of
maturity
levels
of
an
equal
number
of
growth
centers
from
the
long
,
short
,
and
round
bones
of
the
five
regions
.
The
lower
portion
permits
comparison
of
maturity
levels
of
short
and
round
bones
predominantly
,
since
only
two
long
bones
are
included
in
Hand
and
Wrist
as
a
region
.
Third
,
the
upper
portion
deals
with
only
two
indicators
of
developmental
level
,
Onset
and
Completion
.
The
lower
portion
utilizes
the
full
complement
of
intermediate
maturity
indicators
of
each
Hand
center
as
well
as
their
Onset
and
Completion
.
Fourth
,
the
two
indicators
are
for
the
most
part
widely
separated
chronologically
,
with
the
extensive
age
gap
occurring
during
childhood
for
all
but
one
growth
center
.
The
lower
portion
provides
a
rating
at
any
stage
between
infancy
and
adulthood
.
Onsets
,
Completions
,
and
Skeletal
Ages
(
Hand
)
of
boy
34
and
girl
2
may
be
directly
compared
and
classified
,
using
only
those
Skeletal
Ages
which
appear
immediately
below
the
Onset
Profile
and
the
Completion
Profile
.
It
may
be
assumed
that
differences
in
ratings
due
to
selection
of
growth
centers
from
specific
regions
of
the
body
will
be
small
,
according
to
existing
tables
of
onset
age
and
completion
age
for
centers
throughout
the
body
.
Accordingly
,
maturity
level
ratings
by
means
of
the
upper
portion
and
lower
portion
of
the
Chart
,
respectively
,
should
be
somewhat
similar
since
Skeletal
Age
assessments
are
dependent
upon
Onsets
during
infancy
and
upon
Completions
during
adolescence
.
It
is
clear
that
there
are
some
differences
in
the
ratings
,
but
there
is
substantial
agreement
.
Since
a
Skeletal
Age
rating
can
be
made
at
any
age
during
growth
,
from
Elbow
,
Shoulder
,
Knee
,
or
Foot
as
well
as
Hand
,
it
seems
to
be
the
method
of
choice
when
one
wishes
to
study
most
aspects
of
skeletal
developmental
progress
during
childhood
.
As
stated
earlier
in
the
paper
,
Onsets
and
Completions
--
particularly
the
former
--
provide
a
different
tool
or
indicator
of
expectancy
in
osseous
development
,
each
within
a
limited
age
period
.
Such
an
indicator
,
or
indicators
,
are
needed
as
means
of
recognizing
specific
periods
of
delay
in
skeletal
developmental
progress
.
It
was
stated
earlier
that
one
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
extend
the
analysis
of
variability
of
Onset
and
Completion
in
each
of
the
21
growth
centers
somewhat
beyond
that
provided
by
the
data
in
Tables
1
and
2
.
As
one
approach
to
doing
this
,
Figures
3
and
4
have
be
constructed
from
the
mean
ages
and
the
individual
onset
and
completion
ages
for
boy
34
and
girl
2
.
The
differences
between
onset
age
and
completion
age
with
respect
to
the
corresponding
mean
age
have
been
brought
into
juxtaposition
by
means
of
a
series
of
arrows
.
The
data
for
boy
34
appear
in
Figure
3
,
and
for
girl
2
in
Figure
4
.
The
numbering
system
used
in
Tables
1
and
2
and
Figures
1
and
2
was
continued
for
the
21
growth
centers
.
The
``
dot
''
on
one
end
of
each
arrow
indicates
extent
of
difference
in
months
between
the
child's
onset
age
and
the
corresponding
mean
age
for
the
growth
center
.
The
``
tip
''
of
the
arrow
represents
extent
of
difference
between
the
child's
completion
age
and
the
corresponding
mean
age
for
the
growth
center
.
Thus
,
the
alignment
of
the
``
dots
''
and
``
tips
''
,
respectively
,
indicate
individual
variability
of
the
21
growth
centers
of
each
child
with
respect
to
the
mean
values
for
these
boys
and
girls
.
The
direction
in
which
the
arrow
points
shows
how
the
maturity
level
of
the
growth
center
was
changed
at
Completion
from
the
level
at
Onset
.
When
the
``
dot
''
and
``
tip
''
coincide
,
the
classification
used
in
this
paper
is
``
Same
schedule
''
.
The
length
of
the
arrow
indicates
amount
of
slowing
or
acceleration
at
Completion
over
that
at
Onset
,
and
the
difference
in
months
can
be
read
roughly
by
referring
the
arrow
to
the
age
scale
along
the
base
of
each
figure
,
or
more
precisely
by
referring
to
the
original
data
in
the
appropriate
tables
.
The
difference
between
the
sequence
of
Onset
of
ossification
for
the
sexes
governs
the
numbering
sequence
in
Figures
3
and
4
.
This
difference
is
readily
clarified
by
referring
to
Table
1
.
For
example
,
arrow
17
in
Figure
3
portrays
the
proximal
radial
epiphysis
for
boy
34
,
whereas
the
same
epiphysis
for
girl
2
is
portrayed
by
arrow
18
in
Figure
4
.
For
the
boy
,
this
epiphysis
was
markedly
delayed
at
Onset
but
near
the
mean
at
Completion
.
Thus
,
the
Span
of
its
ossification
was
shortened
and
the
center's
ability
to
``
catch
up
''
in
ossification
is
demonstrated
.
In
contrast
,
for
the
girl
the
epiphysis
was
slightly
advanced
at
Onset
and
delayed
at
Completion
.
Obviously
,
the
slowing
for
her
may
have
occurred
at
any
point
between
Onset
and
Completion
.
The
Skeletal
Age
curve
in
the
lower
portion
of
Figure
2
shows
that
slowing
may
have
occurred
for
her
during
the
prepubescent
period
.
Length
of
the
shaft
of
these
arrows
may
be
evaluated
according
to
the
standard
deviation
values
for
each
center
in
Table
1
.
We
have
attempted
to
simplify
the
extensive
task
of
analyzing
onset
ages
and
completion
ages
of
each
child
--
more
than
1700
values
for
the
entire
group
--
by
constructing
figures
for
each
of
the
21
centers
so
that
the
data
for
all
34
boys
and
34
of
the
girls
will
appear
together
for
each
growth
center
.
Figures
5
and
6
are
examples
of
our
method
of
analyzing
the
results
for
each
growth
center
.
Forty
other
figures
similar
to
5
and
6
and
the
original
data
used
in
the
construction
of
all
figures
and
tables
in
this
monograph
have
been
included
in
the
Appendix
.
The
principles
used
in
making
each
arrow
for
Figures
3
and
4
were
applied
to
the
construction
of
Figures
5
and
6
as
well
as
all
figures
in
the
Appendix
.
One
growth
center
in
a
short
bone
--
distal
phalanx
of
the
second
finger
--
was
chosen
as
an
example
for
discussion
here
,
primarily
because
epiphyseal-diaphyseal
fusion
,
the
maturity
indicator
for
Completion
in
long
and
short
bones
,
occurs
in
this
center
for
girls
near
the
menarche
and
for
boys
near
their
comparable
pubescent
stage
.
Its
Completion
thus
becomes
one
of
the
convenient
maturity
indicators
to
include
in
studies
of
growth
,
dietary
patterns
,
and
health
during
adolescence
.
The
following
summary
,
based
on
Figures
5
and
6
,
is
an
example
of
one
way
of
interpreting
the
42
figures
constructed
from
onset
ages
and
completion
ages
of
individual
children
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
mean
age
for
each
growth
center
.
At
the
top
of
Figure
5
,
for
example
,
the
Onset
range
and
Completion
range
lines
for
the
chosen
growth
center
have
been
drawn
for
girls
according
to
their
mean
and
standard
deviation
values
in
Table
1
.
The
34
arrows
,
denoting
onset
age
plus
completion
age
deviations
,
have
been
arrayed
in
an
Onset
sequence
which
begins
with
girl
18
who
had
the
earliest
Onset
of
the
34
girls
.
The
growth
center
depicted
here
,
in
the
distal
phalanx
of
the
second
finger
,
is
listed
as
the
fifth
of
those
in
the
seven
short
bones
.
The
mean
onset
age
was
25.3
months
(
Table
1
)
,
and
the
average
Span
of
the
osseous
stage
was
133
months
.
The
correlation
(
Table
2
)
between
onset
age
and
completion
age
was
-.50
,
and
that
between
onset
age
and
Span
was
-.10
.
With
due
consideration
for
the
limits
of
precision
in
assessing
,
expected
rate
of
change
in
ossification
of
girls
age
2
years
,
and
the
known
variations
in
rate
of
ossification
of
these
children
as
described
in
our
preceding
paper
in
the
Supplement
,
each
arrow
with
a
``
shaft
length
''
of
four
months
or
less
was
selected
as
indicating
``
same
schedule
''
at
Onset
and
Completion
,
for
this
particular
epiphysis
.
Accordingly
,
girls
31
,
29
,
33
,
21
,
26
,
13
,
3
,
4
,
14
,
32
,
24
,
25
,
34
,
23
,
6
,
15
,
22
,
and
16
may
be
said
to
have
the
``
same
schedule
''
at
Onset
and
Completion
.
It
seems
clear
,
from
the
counter-balanced
shape
of
the
series
of
arrows
in
Figure
5
that
there
was
about
an
equal
number
of
early
and
late
Onsets
and
Completions
for
the
34
girls
.
Accordingly
,
if
epiphyseal-diaphyseal
fusion
occurs
in
this
phalanx
near
menarche
,
early
and
late
menarches
might
have
been
forecast
rather
precisely
at
the
time
of
Onset
of
ossification
for
the
18
girls
with
``
same
schedule
''
.
As
an
example
of
the
interpretation
of
an
arrow
in
the
figure
which
exceeds
four
months
in
shaft
length
in
conjunction
with
its
position
in
the
figure
:
girl
2
had
a
delayed
Onset
and
further
delayed
Completion
.
It
is
of
interest
that
her
menarche
was
somewhat
later
than
the
average
for
the
girls
in
this
group
.
A
similar
analysis
of
Figure
6
for
the
34
boys
would
necessitate
quite
a
different
conclusion
about
the
predictive
value
of
onset
age
in
forecasting
their
attainment
of
the
pubescent
stage
.
Boys
32
,
23
,
31
,
17
,
30
,
19
,
and
24
had
``
same
schedule
''
at
Onset
and
Completion
;
;
thus
early
forecasting
of
the
pubescent
stage
would
appear
possible
for
only
seven
boys
.
Boy
34
,
like
girl
2
,
did
not
have
``
same
schedule
''
;
;
his
arrow
crosses
the
line
denoting
the
mean
.
The
``
dot
''
on
his
arrow
indicates
early
Onset
and
the
``
tip
''
indicates
relatively
later
Completion
.
After
the
42
figures
had
been
drawn
like
Figures
5
and
6
,
classifications
of
the
onset
ages
and
completion
ages
were
summarized
from
them
.
Interestingly
enough
,
the
effect
of
the
digitalis
glycosides
is
inhibited
by
a
high
concentration
of
potassium
in
the
incubation
medium
and
is
enhanced
by
the
absence
of
potassium
(
Wolff
,
1960
)
.
B
.
Organification
of
iodine
The
precise
mechanism
for
organification
of
iodine
in
the
thyroid
is
not
as
yet
completely
understood
.
However
,
the
formation
of
organically
bound
iodine
,
mainly
mono-iodotyrosine
,
can
be
accomplished
in
cell-free
systems
.
In
the
absence
of
additions
to
the
homogenate
,
the
product
formed
is
an
iodinated
particulate
protein
(
Fawcett
and
Kirkwood
,
1953
;
;
Taurog
,
Potter
and
Chaikoff
,
1955
;
;
Taurog
,
Potter
,
Tong
,
and
Chaikoff
,
1956
;
;
Serif
and
Kirkwood
,
1958
;
;
De
Groot
and
Carvalho
,
1960
)
.
This
iodoprotein
does
not
appear
to
be
the
same
as
what
is
normally
present
in
the
thyroid
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
so
far
that
thyroglobulin
can
be
iodinated
in
vitro
by
cell-free
systems
.
In
addition
,
the
iodoamino
acid
formed
in
largest
quantity
in
the
intact
thyroid
is
di-iodotyrosine
.
If
tyrosine
and
a
system
generating
hydrogen
peroxide
are
added
to
a
cell-free
homogenate
of
the
thyroid
,
large
quantities
of
free
mono-iodotyrosine
can
be
formed
(
Alexander
,
1959
)
.
It
is
not
clear
whether
this
system
bears
any
resemblance
to
the
in
vivo
iodinating
mechanism
,
and
a
system
generating
peroxide
has
not
been
identified
in
thyroid
tissue
.
On
chemical
grounds
it
seems
most
likely
that
iodide
is
first
converted
to
Af
and
then
to
Af
as
the
active
iodinating
species
.
In
the
thyroid
gland
it
appears
that
proteins
(
chiefly
thyroglobulin
)
are
iodinated
and
that
free
tyrosine
and
thyronine
are
not
iodinated
.
Iodination
of
tyrosine
,
however
,
is
not
enough
for
the
synthesis
of
hormone
.
The
mono-
and
di-iodotyrosine
must
be
coupled
to
form
tri-iodothyronine
and
thyroxine
.
The
mechanism
of
this
coupling
has
been
studied
in
some
detail
with
non-enzymatic
systems
in
vitro
and
can
be
simulated
by
certain
di-iodotyrosine
analogues
(
Pitt-Rivers
and
James
,
1958
)
.
There
is
so
far
no
evidence
to
indicate
conclusively
that
this
coupling
is
under
enzymatic
control
.
The
chemical
nature
of
the
iodocompounds
is
discussed
below
(
pp.
76
et
seq.
)
.
C
.
Thyroglobulin
synthesis
Little
is
known
of
the
synthetic
mechanisms
for
formation
of
thyroglobulin
.
Its
synthesis
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
cell-free
systems
,
nor
has
its
synthesis
by
systems
with
intact
thyroid
cells
in
vitro
been
unequivocally
proven
.
There
is
some
reason
to
think
that
thyroglobulin
synthesis
may
proceed
independently
of
iodination
,
for
in
certain
transplantable
tumours
of
the
rat
thyroid
containing
essentially
no
iodinated
thyroglobulin
,
a
protein
that
appears
to
be
thyroglobulin
has
been
observed
in
ultracentrifuge
experiments
(
Wolff
,
Robbins
and
Rall
,
1959
)
.
Similar
findings
have
been
noted
in
a
patient
with
congenital
absence
of
the
organification
enzymes
,
whose
thyroid
tissue
could
only
concentrate
iodide
.
In
addition
,
depending
on
availability
of
dietary
iodine
,
thyroglobulin
may
contain
varying
quantities
of
iodine
.
D
.
Secretion
Since
the
circulating
thyroid
hormones
are
the
amino
acids
thyroxine
and
tri-iodothyronine
(
cf.
Section
C
)
,
it
is
clear
that
some
mechanism
must
exist
in
the
thyroid
gland
for
their
release
from
proteins
before
secretion
.
The
presence
of
several
proteases
and
peptidases
has
been
demonstrated
in
the
thyroid
.
One
of
the
proteases
has
pH
optimum
of
about
3.7
and
another
of
about
5.7
(
McQuillan
,
Stanley
and
Trikojus
,
1954
;
;
Alpers
,
Robbins
and
Rall
,
1955
)
.
The
finding
that
the
concentration
of
one
of
these
proteases
is
increased
in
thyroid
glands
from
TSH-treated
animals
suggests
that
this
protease
may
be
active
in
vivo
.
There
is
no
conclusive
evidence
yet
that
either
of
the
proteases
has
been
prepared
in
highly
purified
form
nor
is
their
specificity
known
.
A
study
of
their
activity
on
thyroglobulin
has
shown
that
thyroxine
is
not
preferentially
released
and
that
the
degradation
proceeds
stepwise
with
the
formation
of
macromolecular
intermediates
(
Alpers
,
Petermann
and
Rall
,
1956
)
.
Besides
proteolytic
enzymes
the
thyroid
possesses
de-iodinating
enzymes
.
A
microsomal
de-iodinase
with
a
pH
optimum
of
around
8
,
and
requiring
reduced
triphosphopyridine
nucleotide
for
activity
,
has
been
identified
in
the
thyroid
(
Stanbury
,
1957
)
.
This
de-iodinating
enzyme
is
effective
against
mono-
and
di-iodotyrosine
,
but
does
not
de-iodinate
thyroxine
or
tri-iodothyronine
.
It
is
assumed
that
the
iodine
released
from
the
iodotyrosines
remains
in
the
iodide
pool
of
the
thyroid
,
where
it
is
oxidised
and
re-incorporated
into
thyroglobulin
.
The
thyroxine
and
tri-iodothyronine
released
by
proteolysis
and
so
escaping
de-iodination
presumably
diffuse
into
the
blood
stream
.
It
has
been
shown
that
thyroglobulin
binds
thyroxine
,
but
the
binding
does
not
appear
to
be
particularly
strong
.
It
has
been
suggested
that
the
plasma
thyroxine-binding
proteins
,
which
have
an
extremely
high
affinity
for
thyroxine
,
compete
with
thyroglobulin
for
thyroxine
(
Ingbar
and
Freinkel
,
1957
)
.
E
.
Antithyroid
drugs
Antithyroid
drugs
are
of
two
general
types
.
One
type
has
a
small
univalent
anion
of
the
thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro
type
.
This
ion
inhibits
thyroid
hormone
synthesis
by
interfering
with
iodide
concentration
in
the
thyroid
.
It
does
not
appear
to
affect
the
iodinating
mechanism
as
such
.
The
other
group
of
antithyroid
agents
or
drugs
is
typified
by
thiouracil
.
These
drugs
have
no
effect
on
the
iodide
concentrating
mechanism
,
but
they
inhibit
organification
.
The
mechanism
of
action
of
these
drugs
has
not
been
completely
worked
out
,
but
certain
of
them
appear
to
act
by
reducing
the
oxidised
form
of
iodine
before
it
can
iodinate
thyroglobulin
(
Astwood
,
1954
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
a
few
antithyroid
drugs
of
this
same
general
type
,
such
as
resorcinol
,
possessing
no
reducing
activity
and
possibly
acting
through
formation
of
a
complex
with
molecular
iodine
.
Any
of
the
antithyroid
drugs
,
of
either
type
,
if
given
in
large
enough
doses
for
a
long
period
of
time
will
cause
goitre
,
owing
to
inhibition
of
thyroid
hormone
synthesis
,
with
production
of
hypothyroidism
.
The
anterior
lobe
of
the
pituitary
then
responds
by
an
increased
output
of
TSH
,
causing
the
thyroid
to
enlarge
.
The
effect
of
drugs
that
act
on
the
iodide-concentrating
mechanism
can
be
counteracted
by
addition
of
relatively
large
amounts
of
iodine
to
the
diet
.
The
antithyroid
drugs
of
the
thiouracil
type
,
however
,
are
not
antagonised
by
such
means
.
Besides
those
of
the
thiouracil
and
resorcinol
types
,
certain
antithyroid
drugs
have
been
found
in
naturally
occurring
foods
.
The
most
conclusively
identified
is
L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone
,
which
was
isolated
from
rutabaga
(
Greer
,
1950
)
.
It
is
presumed
to
occur
in
other
members
of
the
Brassica
family
.
There
is
some
evidence
that
naturally
occurring
goitrogens
may
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
goitre
,
particularly
in
Tasmania
and
Australia
(
Clements
and
Wishart
,
1956
)
.
There
it
seems
that
the
goitrogen
ingested
by
dairy
animals
is
itself
inactive
but
is
converted
in
the
animal
to
an
active
goitrogen
,
which
is
then
secreted
in
the
milk
.
F
.
Dietary
influences
Besides
the
presence
of
goitrogens
in
the
diet
,
the
level
of
iodine
itself
in
the
diet
plays
a
major
role
in
governing
the
activity
of
the
thyroid
gland
.
In
the
experimental
animal
and
in
man
gross
deficiency
in
dietary
iodine
causes
thyroid
hyperplasia
,
hypertrophy
and
increased
thyroid
activity
(
Money
,
Rall
and
Rawson
,
1952
;
;
Stanbury
,
Brownell
,
Riggs
,
Perinetti
,
Itoiz
,
and
Del
Castillo
,
1954
)
.
In
man
the
normal
level
of
iodine
in
the
diet
and
the
level
necessary
to
prevent
development
of
goitre
is
about
100
**ymg
per
day
.
With
lower
levels
,
thyroid
hypertrophy
and
increased
thyroid
blood-flow
enable
the
thyroid
to
accumulate
a
larger
proportion
of
the
daily
intake
of
iodine
.
Further
,
the
gland
is
able
to
re-use
a
larger
fraction
of
the
thyroid
hormone
de-iodinated
peripherally
.
In
the
presence
of
a
low
iodine
intake
,
thyroglobulin
labelled
in
vivo
with
Af
is
found
to
contain
more
mono-iodotyrosine
than
normal
,
the
amounts
of
di-iodotyrosine
and
iodothyronines
being
correspondingly
reduced
.
This
appears
to
result
from
both
a
reduced
amount
of
the
iodine
substrate
and
a
more
rapid
secretion
of
newly
iodinated
thyroglobulin
.
If
the
deficiency
persists
long
enough
,
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
Af
label
will
reflect
the
Af
distribution
in
the
thyroglobulin
.
Similar
results
might
be
expected
from
the
influence
of
drugs
or
pathological
conditions
that
limit
iodide
trapping
,
or
organification
,
or
accelerate
thyroglobulin
proteolysis
.
B
.
The
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
The
name
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
(
TSH
)
has
been
given
to
a
substance
found
in
the
anterior
pituitary
gland
of
all
species
of
animal
so
tested
for
its
presence
.
The
hormone
has
also
been
called
thyrotrophin
or
thyrotrophic
hormone
.
At
the
present
time
we
do
not
know
by
what
biochemical
mechanism
TSH
acts
on
the
thyroid
,
but
for
bio-assay
of
the
hormone
there
are
a
number
of
properties
by
which
its
activity
may
be
estimated
,
including
release
of
iodine
from
the
thyroid
,
increase
in
thyroid
weight
,
increase
in
mean
height
of
the
follicular
cells
and
increase
in
the
thyroidal
uptake
of
Af
.
Here
we
shall
restrict
discussion
to
those
methods
that
appear
sufficiently
sensitive
and
precise
for
determining
the
concentration
of
TSH
in
blood
.
Brown
(
1959
)
has
reviewed
generally
the
various
methods
of
assaying
TSH
,
and
the
reader
is
referred
to
her
paper
for
further
information
on
the
subject
.

.
Chemical
constitution
and
physical
properties
of
pituitary
tsh
As
long
ago
as
1851
it
was
pointed
out
by
Niepce
(
1851
)
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
pituitary
and
the
thyroid
.
This
connection
was
clarified
by
Smith
and
Smith
(
1922
)
,
who
showed
that
saline
extracts
of
fresh
bovine
pituitary
glands
could
re-activate
the
atrophied
thyroids
of
hypophysectomised
tadpoles
.
The
first
attempts
to
isolate
TSH
came
a
decade
later
,
when
Janssen
and
Loeser
(
1931
)
used
trichloroacetic
acid
to
separate
the
soluble
TSH
from
insoluble
impurities
.
After
their
work
other
investigators
applied
salt-fractionation
techniques
to
the
problem
,
as
well
as
fractionation
with
organic
solvents
,
such
as
acetone
.
Albert
(
1949
)
has
concluded
that
the
most
active
preparations
of
TSH
made
during
this
period
,
from
1931
to
1945
,
were
probably
about
100
to
300
times
as
potent
as
the
starting
material
.
Much
of
this
work
has
been
reviewed
by
White
(
1944
)
and
by
Albert
(
1949
)
.
Developments
up
to
about
1957
have
been
discussed
by
Sonenberg
(
1958
)
.
In
the
last
few
years
,
the
application
of
chromatographic
and
other
modern
techniques
to
the
problem
of
isolating
TSH
has
led
to
further
purification
(
Bates
and
Condliffe
,
1960
;
;
Pierce
,
Carsten
and
Wynston
,
1960
)
.
The
most
active
preparations
obtained
by
these
two
groups
of
investigators
appear
to
be
similar
in
potency
,
composition
and
physical
properties
.
Two
problems
present
themselves
in
considering
any
hormone
in
blood
.
First
,
is
the
circulating
form
of
the
hormone
the
same
as
that
found
in
the
gland
where
it
is
synthesised
and
stored
?
?
Second
,
what
is
its
concentration
in
normal
circumstances
and
in
what
circumstances
will
this
concentration
depart
from
the
normal
level
and
in
which
direction
?
?
It
is
therefore
necessary
to
consider
the
properties
of
pituitary
TSH
if
the
fragmentary
chemical
information
about
blood
TSH
is
to
be
discussed
rationally
.
The
importance
of
knowing
in
what
chemical
forms
the
hormone
may
exist
is
accentuated
by
the
recent
observation
that
there
exists
an
abnormally
long-acting
TSH
in
blood
drawn
from
many
thyrotoxic
patients
(
Adams
,
1958
)
.
Whether
this
abnormal
TSH
differs
chemically
from
pituitary
TSH
,
or
is
,
alternatively
,
normal
TSH
with
its
period
of
effectiveness
modified
by
some
other
blood
constituent
,
cannot
be
decided
without
chemical
study
of
the
activity
in
the
blood
of
these
patients
and
a
comparison
of
the
substance
responsible
for
the
blood
activity
with
pituitary
Aj
.
In
evaluating
data
on
the
concentration
of
TSH
in
blood
,
one
must
examine
critically
the
bio-assay
methods
used
to
obtain
them
.
The
introduction
of
the
United
States
Pharmacopoeia
reference
standard
in
1952
and
the
redefinition
and
equating
of
the
USP
and
international
units
of
thyroid-stimulating
activity
have
made
it
possible
to
compare
results
published
by
different
investigators
since
that
time
.
We
should
like
to
re-emphasise
the
importance
of
stating
results
solely
in
terms
of
international
units
of
TSH
activity
and
of
avoiding
the
re-introduction
of
biological
units
.
For
the
most
part
,
this
discussion
will
be
confined
to
results
obtained
since
the
introduction
of
the
reference
standard
.
A
.
Standard
preparations
and
units
of
thyroid-stimulating
activity
The
international
unit
(
u.
)
,
adopted
to
make
possible
the
comparison
of
results
from
different
laboratories
(
Mussett
and
Perry
,
1955
)
,
has
been
defined
as
the
amount
of
activity
present
in
13.5
mg
of
the
International
Standard
Preparation
.
The
international
unit
is
equipotent
with
the
USP
unit
adopted
in
1952
,
which
was
defined
as
the
amount
of
activity
present
in
20
mg
of
the
USP
reference
substance
.
Introduction
Muscle
weakness
is
now
recognized
as
an
uncommon
though
serious
complication
of
steroid
therapy
,
with
most
of
the
synthetic
adrenal
corticosteroids
in
clinical
use
.
Although
biopsies
have
shown
structural
changes
in
some
of
the
reported
cases
of
steroid-induced
weakness
,
this
case
provides
the
only
example
known
to
us
in
which
necropsy
afforded
the
opportunity
for
extensive
study
of
multiple
muscle
groups
.
The
case
described
in
this
paper
is
that
of
an
older
man
who
developed
disabling
muscular
weakness
while
receiving
a
variety
of
steroids
for
a
refractory
anemia
.
Report
of
case
This
patient
was
a
65-year-old
white
male
accountant
who
entered
the
New
York
Hospital
for
his
fourth
and
terminal
admission
on
June
26
,
1959
,
because
of
disabling
weakness
and
general
debility
.
In
1953
the
patient
developed
an
unexplained
anemia
for
which
15
blood
transfusions
were
given
over
a
period
of
4
years
.
Splenomegaly
was
first
noted
in
1956
,
and
a
sternal
marrow
biopsy
at
that
time
showed
``
scattered
foci
of
fibrosis
''
suggestive
of
myelofibrosis
.
No
additional
transfusions
were
necessary
after
the
institution
of
prednisone
in
July
,
1957
,
in
an
initial
dose
of
40
mg.
daily
with
gradual
tapering
to
10
mg.
daily
.
This
medication
was
continued
until
February
,
1958
.
In
February
,
1958
,
the
patient
suffered
a
myocardial
infarction
complicated
by
pulmonary
edema
.
Additional
findings
at
this
time
included
cardiomegaly
,
peripheral
arteriosclerosis
obliterans
,
and
cholelithiasis
.
The
hemoglobin
was
11.6
gm.
.
Therapy
included
digitalization
and
anticoagulation
.
Later
,
chlorothiazide
and
salt
restriction
became
necessary
to
control
the
edema
of
chronic
congestive
failure
.
Because
of
increasing
anemia
,
triamcinolone
,
8
mg.
daily
,
was
started
on
Feb.
23
,
1958
,
and
was
continued
until
July
,
1958
.
In
September
,
1958
,
the
patient
developed
generalized
weakness
and
fatigue
which
was
concurrent
with
exacerbation
of
his
anemia
;
;
the
hemoglobin
was
10.6
gm.
.
In
an
attempt
to
reverse
the
downhill
trend
by
stimulating
the
bone
marrow
and
controlling
any
hemolytic
component
,
triamcinolone
,
16
mg.
daily
,
was
begun
on
Sept.
26
,
1958
,
and
continued
until
Feb.
18
,
1959
.
At
first
the
patient
felt
stronger
,
and
the
hemoglobin
rose
to
13.8
gm.
,
but
on
Oct.
20
,
1958
,
he
complained
of
``
caving
in
''
in
his
knees
.
By
Nov.
8
,
1958
,
weakness
,
specifically
involving
the
pelvic
and
thigh
musculature
,
was
pronounced
,
and
a
common
complaint
was
``
difficulty
in
stepping
up
on
to
curbs
''
.
Prednisone
,
30
mg.
daily
,
was
substituted
for
triamcinolone
from
Nov.
22
until
Dec.
1
,
1958
,
without
any
improvement
in
the
weakness
.
Serum
potassium
at
this
time
was
3.8
mEq.
per
liter
,
and
the
hemoglobin
was
13.9
gm.
By
Dec.
1
,
1958
,
the
weakness
in
the
pelvic
and
quadriceps
muscle
groups
was
appreciably
worse
,
and
it
became
difficult
for
the
patient
to
rise
unaided
from
a
sitting
or
reclining
position
.
Triamcinolone
,
16
mg.
daily
,
was
resumed
and
maintained
until
Feb.
18
,
1959
.
Chlorothiazide
was
omitted
for
a
2-week
period
,
but
there
was
no
change
in
the
muscle
weakness
.
At
this
time
a
detailed
neuromuscular
examination
revealed
diffuse
muscle
atrophy
that
was
moderate
in
the
hands
and
feet
,
but
marked
in
the
shoulders
,
hips
,
and
pelvic
girdle
,
with
hypoactive
deep-tendon
reflexes
.
No
fasciculations
or
sensory
defects
were
found
.
Electromyography
revealed
no
evidence
of
lower
motor
neuron
disease
.
Thyroid
function
tests
yielded
normal
results
.
The
protein-bound
iodine
was
6.6
mg.
,
and
the
radioactive
iodine
uptake
over
the
thyroid
gland
was
46%
in
24
hours
,
with
a
conversion
ratio
of
12%
.
A
Schilling
test
demonstrated
normal
absorption
of
vitamin
Af
.
In
February
,
1959
,
during
the
second
admission
to
The
New
York
Hospital
,
a
biopsy
specimen
of
the
left
gastrocnemius
showed
striking
increase
in
the
sarcolemmal
sheath
nuclei
and
shrunken
muscle
fibers
in
several
sections
.
Serial
serum
potassium
levels
remained
normal
;
;
the
serum
glutamic
oxaloacetic
transaminase
was
10
units
per
ml.
per
min.
.
The
clinical
impression
at
this
time
was
either
muscular
dystrophy
or
polymyositis
.
On
Feb.
12
,
1959
,
purified
corticotropin
(
ACTH
Gel
)
,
20
units
daily
intramuscularly
,
was
started
but
had
to
be
discontinued
3
weeks
later
because
of
excessive
fluid
retention
.
From
March
3
to
May
1
,
1949
,
the
patient
was
maintained
on
dexamethasone
,
3
to
6
mg.
daily
.
In
May
1959
,
prednisone
,
30
mg.
daily
,
replaced
the
dexamethasone
.
Muscle
weakness
did
not
improve
,
and
the
patient
needed
first
a
cane
,
then
crutches
.
In
spite
of
normal
thyroid
function
tests
,
a
trial
of
propylthiouracil
,
400
mg.
daily
for
one
week
,
was
given
but
served
only
to
intensify
muscle
weakness
.
Repeated
attempts
to
withdraw
steroids
entirely
were
unsuccessful
because
increased
muscle
weakness
resulted
,
as
well
as
fever
,
malaise
,
anorexia
,
anxiety
,
and
an
exacerbation
of
the
anemia
.
These
reactions
were
interpreted
as
being
manifestations
of
hypoadrenocorticism
.
Severe
back
pain
in
June
,
1959
,
prompted
a
third
hospital
admission
.
Extensive
osteoporosis
with
partial
collapse
of
D8
was
found
.
A
high-protein
diet
,
calcium
lactate
supplements
,
and
norethandrolone
failed
to
change
the
skeletal
complaint
or
the
severe
muscle
weakness
.
The
terminal
hospital
admission
on
June
27
,
1959
,
was
necessitated
by
continued
weakness
and
debility
complicated
by
urinary
retention
and
painful
thrombosed
hemorrhoids
.
X-ray
films
of
the
vertebral
column
showed
progression
of
the
demineralization
.
On
July
4
,
1959
,
the
patient
developed
marked
abdominal
pain
and
distension
,
went
into
shock
,
and
died
.
Findings
at
necropsy
The
body
was
that
of
a
well-developed
,
somewhat
debilitated
white
man
weighing
108
lb.
.
There
were
bilateral
pterygia
and
arcus
senilis
,
and
the
mouth
was
edentulous
.
The
heart
weighed
510
gm.
,
and
at
the
outflow
tracts
the
left
and
right
ventricles
measured
19
and
3
mm.
,
respectively
.
The
coronary
arteries
were
sclerotic
and
diffusely
narrowed
throughout
their
courses
,
and
the
right
coronary
artery
was
virtually
occluded
by
a
yellow
atheromatous
plaque
1.5
cm.
distal
to
its
origin
.
The
myocardium
of
the
posterior
base
of
the
left
ventricle
was
replaced
by
gray
scar
tissue
over
a
7.5
cm.
area
.
The
valves
were
normal
except
for
thin
yellow
plaques
on
the
inferior
surface
of
the
mitral
leaflets
.
Microscopically
,
sections
from
the
posterior
base
of
the
left
ventricle
of
the
heart
showed
several
large
areas
of
replacement
of
muscle
by
fibrous
tissue
.
In
addition
,
other
sections
contained
focal
areas
of
recent
myocardial
necrosis
that
were
infiltrated
with
neutrophils
.
Many
of
the
myocardial
fibers
were
hypertrophied
and
had
large
,
irregular
,
basophilic
nuclei
.
The
intima
of
the
larger
coronary
arteries
was
thickened
by
fibrous
tissue
containing
fusiform
clefts
and
mononuclear
cells
.
The
intimal
surface
of
the
aorta
was
covered
with
confluent
,
yellow-brown
,
hard
,
friable
plaques
along
its
entire
course
,
and
there
was
a
marked
narrowing
of
the
orifices
of
the
large
major
visceral
arteries
.
In
particular
,
the
orifices
of
the
right
renal
and
celiac
arteries
were
virtually
occluded
,
and
both
calcified
common
iliac
arteries
were
completely
occluded
.
The
lungs
weighed
together
950
gm.
.
On
the
surfaces
of
both
lungs
there
were
emphysematous
blebs
measuring
up
to
3
cm.
in
diameter
.
The
parenchyma
was
slightly
hyperemic
in
the
apex
of
the
left
lung
,
and
there
were
several
firm
,
gray
,
fibrocalcific
nodules
measuring
as
large
as
3
mm.
.
Microscopically
,
there
was
emphysema
,
fibrosis
,
and
vascular
congestion
.
Macrophages
laden
with
brown
pigment
were
seen
in
some
of
the
alveoli
,
and
the
intima
of
some
of
the
small
arteries
was
thickened
by
fibrous
tissue
.
The
firm
red
spleen
weighed
410
gm.
,
and
its
surface
was
mottled
by
discrete
,
small
patches
of
white
material
.
The
endothelial
cells
lining
the
sinusoids
were
prominent
,
and
many
contained
large
quantities
of
hemosiderin
.
Some
of
the
sinusoids
contained
large
numbers
of
nucleated
red
cells
,
and
cells
of
the
granulocytic
series
were
found
in
small
numbers
.
There
were
slight
fibrosis
and
marked
arteriolosclerosis
.
The
liver
weighed
2,090
gm.
,
was
brown
in
color
,
and
the
cut
surface
was
mottled
by
irregular
pale
areas
.
Microscopically
,
there
was
hyperemia
of
the
central
veins
,
and
there
was
some
atrophy
of
adjacent
parenchyma
.
Some
liver
cord
cells
contained
vacuolated
cytoplasm
,
while
others
had
small
amounts
of
brown
hemosiderin
pigment
.
The
gallbladder
contained
about
40
cc.
of
green-brown
bile
and
3
smooth
,
dark-green
calculi
measuring
up
to
1
cm.
in
diameter
.
The
mucosa
of
the
stomach
was
atrophic
and
irregularly
blackened
over
a
14
cm.
area
.
The
small
and
large
intestines
were
filled
with
gas
,
and
the
jejunum
was
dilated
to
about
2
times
its
normal
circumference
.
The
small
intestine
and
colon
contained
approximately
300
cc.
of
foul-smelling
,
sanguineous
material
,
and
the
mucosa
throughout
was
hyperemic
and
mottled
green-brown
.
A
careful
search
failed
to
show
occlusion
of
any
of
the
mesenteric
vessels
.
Microscopically
,
the
mucosa
of
the
stomach
showed
extensive
cytolysis
and
contained
large
numbers
of
Gram-negative
bacterial
rods
.
The
submucosa
was
focally
infiltrated
with
neutrophils
.
The
mucosa
of
the
jejunum
and
ileum
showed
similar
changes
,
and
in
some
areas
the
submucosa
was
edematous
and
contained
considerable
numbers
of
neutrophils
.
Some
of
the
small
vessels
were
filled
with
fibrin
thrombi
,
and
there
was
extensive
interstitial
hemorrhage
.
A
section
of
the
colon
revealed
intense
hyperemia
and
extensive
focal
ulcerations
of
the
mucosa
,
associated
with
much
fibrin
and
many
neutrophils
.
Cultures
taken
from
the
jejunum
yielded
Monilia
albicans
,
Pseudomonas
pyocanea
,
Aerobacter
aerogenes
,
and
Streptococcus
anhemolyticus
.
The
kidneys
were
pale
and
weighed
right
,
110
gm.
,
and
left
,
230
gm.
.
The
surfaces
were
coarsely
and
finely
granular
and
punctuated
by
clear
,
fluid-filled
cysts
measuring
up
to
3
cm.
in
diameter
.
On
the
surface
of
the
right
kidney
there
were
also
2
yellow
,
firm
,
friable
raised
areas
measuring
up
to
2
cm.
in
diameter
.
Microscopically
,
both
kidneys
showed
many
small
cortical
scars
in
which
there
was
glomerular
and
interstitial
fibrosis
,
tubular
atrophy
,
and
an
infiltration
of
lymphocytes
and
plasma
cells
.
Occasional
tubules
contained
hyaline
casts
admixed
with
neutrophils
.
Throughout
,
there
were
marked
arteriolosclerosis
and
hyalinization
of
afferent
glomerular
arterioles
.
These
changes
were
more
marked
in
the
atrophic
right
kidney
than
in
the
left
.
In
addition
,
there
were
2
small
papillary
adenomas
in
the
right
kidney
.
The
bone
of
the
vertebral
bodies
,
ribs
,
and
sternum
was
soft
and
was
easily
compressed
.
The
marrow
of
the
vertebral
bodies
was
pale
and
showed
areas
of
fatty
replacement
.
Microscopically
,
there
were
many
areas
of
hypercellularity
alternating
with
areas
of
hypocellularity
.
The
cells
of
the
erythroid
,
myeloid
,
and
megakaryocytic
series
were
normal
except
for
their
numbers
.
There
was
no
evidence
of
fibrosis
.
The
muscles
of
the
extremities
,
chest
wall
,
neck
,
and
abdominal
wall
were
soft
,
pale
,
and
atrophic
.
Microscopic
studies
of
the
gastrocnemius
,
pectoralis
major
,
transversus
abdominis
,
biceps
brachii
,
and
diaphragm
showed
atrophy
as
well
as
varying
degrees
of
injury
ranging
from
swelling
and
vacuolization
to
focal
necrosis
of
the
muscle
fibers
.
These
changes
were
most
marked
in
the
gastrocnemius
and
biceps
and
less
evident
in
the
pectoralis
,
diaphragm
,
and
transversus
.
In
the
gastrocnemius
and
biceps
there
were
many
swollen
and
homogeneous
necrotic
fibers
such
as
that
shown
in
Figure
2
.
Such
swollen
fibers
were
deeply
eosinophilic
,
contained
a
few
pyknotic
nuclei
,
and
showed
loss
of
cross-striations
,
obliteration
of
myofibrils
,
and
prominent
vacuolization
.
The
necrosis
often
involved
only
a
portion
of
the
length
of
a
given
fiber
,
and
usually
the
immediately
adjacent
fibers
were
normal
.
As
shown
in
Figure
3
,
the
protoplasm
of
other
fibers
was
pale
,
granular
,
or
flocculated
and
invaded
by
phagocytes
.
Inflammatory
cells
were
strikingly
absent
.
In
association
with
these
changes
in
the
fibers
,
there
were
striking
alterations
in
the
muscle
nuclei
.
These
were
increased
both
in
number
and
in
size
,
contained
prominent
nucleoli
,
and
were
distributed
throughout
the
fiber
(
Figs.
2
-
5
)
.
In
contrast
to
the
nuclear
changes
described
above
,
another
change
in
muscle
nuclei
was
seen
,
usually
occurring
in
fibers
that
were
somewhat
smaller
than
normal
but
that
showed
distinct
cross-striations
and
myofibrillae
.
The
nuclei
of
these
fibers
,
as
is
shown
in
Figures
3
and
4
,
showed
remarkable
proliferation
and
were
closely
approximated
,
forming
a
chainlike
structure
at
either
the
center
or
the
periphery
of
the
fiber
.
Individual
nuclei
were
usually
oval
to
round
,
though
occasionally
elongated
,
and
frequently
small
and
somewhat
pyknotic
.
At
times
,
clumps
of
10
to
15
closely-packed
nuclei
were
also
observed
.
Occasionally
there
were
small
basophilic
fibers
that
were
devoid
of
myofibrillae
and
contained
many
vesicular
nuclei
with
prominent
nucleoli
(
Fig.
5
)
.
These
were
thought
to
represent
regenerating
fibers
.
Trichrome
stains
failed
to
show
fibrosis
in
the
involved
muscles
.
In
all
of
the
sections
examined
,
the
arterioles
and
small
arteries
were
essentially
normal
.
Purification
of
the
conjugates
In
attempting
to
improve
specificity
of
staining
,
the
fluorescein-labeled
antisera
used
in
both
direct
and
indirect
methods
were
treated
in
one
of
several
ways
:
(
1
)
They
were
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
with
acetone
insoluble
powders
(
Coons
,
1958
)
prepared
from
mouse
liver
or
from
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
or
crown
gall
tissue
produced
by
Agrobacterium
tumefaciens
(
E.
F.
Smith
&
Townsend
)
on
sweet
clover
stems
.
(
2
)
The
conjugates
as
well
as
the
intermediate
sera
were
absorbed
for
30
minutes
with
20
-
50
mg
of
proteins
extracted
from
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
.
The
proteins
were
extracted
with
3
volumes
of
Af
in
Af
to
give
a
nearly
neutral
extract
and
precipitated
by
80%
saturation
with
Af
.
The
precipitate
was
washed
twice
with
an
80%
saturated
solution
of
Af
,
dissolved
in
a
small
quantity
of
0.1
M
neutral
phosphate
buffer
,
dialyzed
against
cold
distilled
water
till
free
from
ammonium
ions
,
and
lyophilized
using
liquid
nitrogen
.
(

)
In
other
experiments
the
indirect
conjugate
was
treated
with
3
volumes
of
ethyl
acetate
as
recommended
by
Dineen
and
Ade
(
1957
)
.
(
4
)
The
conjugates
were
passed
through
a
diethylaminoethyl
(
DEAE
)
cellulose
column
equilibrated
with
neutral
phosphate
buffer
(
PBS
)
containing
Af
potassium
phosphate
and
Af
.
Preparation
of
frozen
sections
The
technique
of
cutting
sections
was
essentially
the
same
as
that
described
by
Coons
et
al
(
1951
)
.
Root
and
stem
tumors
from
sweet
clover
plants
infected
with
WTV
were
quick-frozen
in
liquid
nitrogen
,
embedded
in
ice
,
and
cut
at
3
-
6
**ym
in
a
cryostat
maintained
at
-16-degrees
to
-20-degrees
.
The
sections
were
mounted
on
cold
slides
smeared
with
Haupts'
adhesive
(
Johansen
,
1940
)
in
earlier
experiments
,
and
in
later
experiments
with
a
different
mixture
of
the
same
components
reported
by
Schramm
and
Rottger
(
1959
)
.
The
latter
adhesive
was
found
to
be
much
more
satisfactory
.
The
sections
were
then
thawed
by
placing
a
finger
under
the
slide
and
dried
under
a
fan
for
30
minutes
;
;
until
used
they
were
stored
for
as
long
as
2
weeks
.
Staining
technique
indirect
method
.
The
sections
were
fixed
in
acetone
for
15
minutes
and
dried
at
37-degrees
for
30
minutes
.
Some
of
them
were
then
covered
with
a
drop
of
Af
in
a
moist
chamber
at
24-degrees
for
30
-
40
minutes
.
As
controls
other
sections
were
similarly
covered
with
Aj
.
Sections
were
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30
minutes
.
After
blotting
out
most
of
the
saline
around
the
sections
,
a
drop
of
Af
was
layered
over
each
of
the
sections
,
allowed
to
react
for
30
minutes
,
and
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30
minutes
.
After
blotting
out
most
of
the
liquid
around
the
sections
,
the
latter
were
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
(
7
parts
glycerine
to
3
parts
of
PBS
)
.
Direct
method
.
After
drying
the
sections
under
the
fan
,
fixing
in
acetone
,
and
drying
at
37-degrees
as
in
the
indirect
method
,
the
sections
were
treated
with
conjugated
Af
or
Af
(
undiluted
unless
mentioned
otherwise
)
for
5
-
30
minutes
.
As
controls
,
other
sections
were
similarly
treated
with
Af
or
conjugated
antiserum
to
the
New
York
strain
of
potato
yellow-dwarf
virus
(
Wolcyrz
and
Black
,
1956
)
.
The
sections
were
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30
minutes
and
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
.
Fluorescence
microscopy
Stained
or
unstained
sections
were
examined
under
dark
field
illumination
in
a
Zeiss
fluorescence
microscope
equipped
with
a
mercury
vapor
lamp
(
Osram
HBO
200
)
.
The
light
beam
from
the
lamp
was
filtered
through
a
half-standard
thickness
Corning
1840
filter
.
In
the
eyepiece
a
Wratten
2
B
filter
was
used
to
filter
off
residual
ultra-violet
light
.
A
red
filter
,
Zeiss
barrier
filter
with
the
code
(
Schott
)
designation
BG
23
,
was
also
used
in
the
ocular
lens
assembly
as
it
improved
the
contrast
between
specific
and
nonspecific
fluorescence
.
Results
specificity
of
staining
indirect
method
.
In
the
first
few
experiments
Af
was
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
absorbed
twice
with
50
-
100
mg
sweet
clover
tissue
powder
.
The
intermediate
sera
were
also
similarly
absorbed
with
tissue
powder
.
Sections
of
sweet
clover
stem
and
root
tumors
were
treated
with
1
:
10
solution
of
Af
for
30
minutes
,
washed
in
buffered
saline
for
15
minutes
,
stained
with
Af
for
30
minutes
,
and
washed
for
15
minutes
in
Aj
.
Such
sections
showed
bright
yellow-green
specific
fluorescence
in
the
cells
of
the
pseudophloem
tissue
(
Lee
and
Black
,
1955
)
.
This
specific
fluorescence
was
readily
distinguished
from
the
light
green
nonspecific
fluorescence
in
consecutive
sections
stained
with
1
:
10
dilution
of
NS
and
Af
or
with
Af
alone
.
Unstained
sections
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
or
sections
treated
only
with
NS
or
Af
did
not
show
such
green
fluorescence
.
Sections
of
crown
gall
tissue
similarly
stained
with
either
Af
and
Af
or
NS
and
Af
also
showed
only
the
light
green
nonspecific
fluorescence
.
However
,
the
nonspecific
staining
by
the
Af
in
tumor
sections
was
considered
bright
enough
to
be
confused
with
the
staining
of
small
amounts
of
WTV
antigen
.
Two
absorptions
of
Af
with
ethyl
acetate
or
two
absorptions
of
Af
(
which
had
been
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
)
,
NS
and
Af
with
crown
gall
tissue
powder
,
or
mouse
liver
powder
did
not
further
improve
the
specificity
of
staining
.
Treatment
of
all
the
sera
with
sweet
clover
proteins
greatly
reduced
nonspecific
fluorescence
,
especially
when
the
treated
conjugate
was
diluted
to
1
:
2
with
0.85%
saline
.
In
all
the
above
procedures
,
when
the
intermediate
sera
were
diluted
to
1
:
10
or
1
:
100
with
0.85%
saline
,
the
specific
and
nonspecific
fluorescence
were
not
appreciably
reduced
,
whereas
,
a
dilution
of
the
intermediate
sera
to
1
:
500
or
diluting
the
Af
to
1
:
5
greatly
reduced
specific
fluorescence
.
Rinsing
the
sections
with
PBS
before
layering
the
intermediate
sera
did
not
improve
the
staining
reaction
.
In
addition
to
other
treatments
,
treating
the
sections
with
normal
sheep
serum
for
half
an
hour
before
layering
Af
did
not
reduce
nonspecific
staining
.
The
only
treatment
by
which
nonspecific
staining
could
be
satisfactorily
removed
was
by
passing
the
conjugate
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
.
When
1
ml
of
conjugate
was
passed
through
a
column
(
Af
)
,
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
collected
were
the
most
specific
and
gave
no
nonspecific
staining
in
some
experiments
,
and
very
little
in
others
.
In
the
latter
cases
an
additional
treatment
of
the
DEAE-cellulose-treated
Af
with
50
mg
of
sweet
clover
stem
tissue
powder
further
improved
the
specificity
.
After
these
treatments
the
conjugate
did
not
stain
healthy
or
crown
gall
sweet
clover
tissues
or
stained
them
a
very
faint
green
which
was
easily
distinguishable
from
the
bright
yellow-green
specific
staining
.
With
this
purified
conjugate
the
best
staining
procedure
consisted
of
treating
the
sections
with
1
:
10
dilution
of
Af
for
30
minutes
,
washing
with
PBS
for
15
minutes
,
staining
with
Af
for
30
minutes
,
and
washing
with
PBS
for
15
minutes
.
The
specificity
of
staining
in
WTV
tumors
with
Af
and
Af
but
not
with
NS
and
Af
or
with
antiserum
to
potato
yellow-dwarf
virus
and
Af
,
and
the
absence
of
such
staining
in
crown
gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet-clover
,
indicate
that
an
antigen
of
WTV
was
being
stained
.
Direct
method
.
Af
was
first
conjugated
with
50
mg
of
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
.
This
conjugate
was
passed
twice
through
Dowex-2-chloride
and
treated
with
various
tissue
powders
in
the
same
manner
as
described
for
the
indirect
method
.
In
all
cases
a
disturbing
amount
of
nonspecific
staining
was
still
present
although
it
was
still
distinguishable
from
specific
fluorescence
.
In
later
experiments
,
Af
and
Af
were
prepared
by
conjugating
8
mg
of
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
.
These
conjugates
Af
had
much
less
nonspecific
staining
than
the
previous
conjugate
(
with
50
mg
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
)
while
the
specific
staining
was
similar
in
both
cases
.
Nonspecific
staining
could
be
satisfactorily
eliminated
by
passing
these
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
as
described
for
Af
.
The
best
staining
procedure
with
this
purified
Af
consisted
of
staining
with
the
conjugate
for
30
minutes
and
washing
in
PBS
for
15
minutes
.
The
specificity
of
staining
with
Af
was
established
as
follows
:
Af
specifically
stained
tumor
sections
but
not
sections
of
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
or
of
crown
gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet
clover
.
Sections
of
tumors
incited
by
WTV
were
not
similarly
stained
with
conjugated
normal
serum
or
conjugated
antiserum
to
potato
yellow-dwarf
virus
.
After
passing
Af
through
DEAE-cellulose
,
the
titer
of
antibodies
to
WTV
in
the
specific
fraction
was
1
:
4
of
the
titer
before
such
passage
(
precipitin
ring
tests
by
R.
F.
Whitcomb
)
;
;
but
mere
dilution
of
the
conjugate
to
1
:
4
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecific
staining
.
This
indicates
that
increase
in
specificity
of
Af
after
passing
it
through
DEAE-cellulose
was
not
merely
due
to
dilution
.
Specific
staining
by
DEAE-cellulose
treated
Af
and
Af
,
although
clearly
distinguishable
under
the
microscope
from
either
nonspecific
staining
or
autofluorescence
of
cells
,
was
not
satisfactorily
photographed
to
show
such
differences
in
spite
of
many
attempts
with
black
and
white
and
color
photography
.
This
was
chiefly
because
of
the
bluish
white
autofluorescence
from
the
cells
.
The
autofluorescence
from
the
walls
of
the
xylem
cells
was
particularly
brilliant
.
Distribution
of
virus
antigen
Results
of
specific
staining
by
the
direct
and
the
indirect
methods
were
similar
and
showed
the
localization
of
WTV
antigen
in
certain
tissues
of
tumors
.
The
virus
antigen
was
concentrated
in
the
pseudophloem
tissue
.
Frequently
a
few
isolated
thick-walled
cells
or
,
rarely
,
groups
of
such
cells
in
the
xylem
region
,
were
also
specifically
stained
,
but
there
was
no
such
staining
in
epidermis
,
cortex
,
most
xylem
cells
,
ray
cells
,
or
pith
.
Within
the
pseudophloem
cells
the
distribution
of
WTV
antigen
was
irregular
in
the
cytoplasm
.
No
antigen
was
detectable
in
certain
dark
spherical
areas
in
most
cells
.
These
areas
are
thought
to
represent
the
nuclei
.
In
some
tumor
sections
small
spherical
bodies
,
possibly
inclusion
bodies
(
Littau
and
Black
,
1952
)
stained
more
intensely
than
the
rest
of
cytoplasm
and
probably
contained
more
antigen
.
In
all
cases
studied
tissues
of
the
stem
on
which
the
tumor
had
developed
did
not
contain
detectable
amounts
of
WTV
antigen
.
Discussion
In
both
the
direct
and
indirect
methods
of
staining
,
the
conjugates
had
nonspecifically
staining
fractions
.
In
the
indirect
method
,
this
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
tumor
sections
were
stained
light
green
even
when
stained
with
NS
and
Af
or
with
Af
only
.
In
the
direct
method
,
Af
,
not
further
treated
,
stained
certain
tissues
of
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
nonspecifically
and
WTV
tumor
sections
were
similarly
stained
by
comparable
Af
.
After
Af
and
Af
were
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
twice
with
healthy
sweet
clover
tissue
powder
,
nonspecific
staining
was
greatly
reduced
but
a
disturbing
amount
of
such
staining
was
still
present
.
Treatment
of
the
conjugates
with
ethyl
acetate
,
and
the
conjugates
(
which
had
been
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
)
with
mouse
liver
powder
,
sweet
clover
crown
gall
tissue
powder
,
or
healthy
sweet
clover
proteins
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecifically
staining
substances
in
the
conjugates
.
Such
treatments
of
the
conjugates
have
usually
been
successful
in
eliminating
nonspecific
staining
in
several
other
systems
(
Coons
,
1958
)
.
Schramm
and
Rottger
(
1959
)
did
not
report
any
such
nonspecific
staining
of
plant
tissues
with
fluorescein
isocyanate-labeled
antiserum
to
tobacco
mosaic
virus
.
The
reason
for
the
failure
of
these
treatments
to
eliminate
nonspecific
staining
in
the
conjugates
in
our
system
is
not
known
.
In
our
work
the
best
procedure
for
removing
substances
causing
nonspecific
staining
in
order
to
obtain
specific
conjugates
was
to
pass
the
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
and
in
some
cases
to
absorb
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
with
sweet
clover
tissue
powder
.
The
specific
staining
by
both
direct
and
indirect
methods
showed
that
WTV
antigen
was
concentrated
in
the
pseudophloem
tissue
and
in
a
few
thick-walled
cells
in
the
xylem
region
,
but
was
not
detectable
in
any
other
tissues
of
the
root
and
stem
tumors
.
A
study
of
the
distribution
of
WTV
antigen
within
the
pseudophloem
cells
indicates
that
it
is
irregularly
distributed
in
the
cytoplasm
.
Wound-tumor
virus
is
a
leafhopper
transmitted
virus
not
easily
transmissible
by
mechanical
inoculation
(
Black
,
1944
;
;
Brakke
et
al
,
1954
)
.
The
concentration
and
apparent
localization
of
the
WTV
antigen
in
pseudophloem
tissue
of
the
tumor
may
indicate
that
the
virus
preferentially
multiplies
in
the
phloem
and
may
need
to
be
directly
placed
in
this
tissue
in
order
to
infect
plants
.
Since
emotional
reactions
in
the
higher
vertebrates
depend
on
individual
experience
and
are
aroused
in
man
,
in
addition
,
by
complex
symbols
,
one
would
expect
that
the
hypothalamus
could
be
excited
from
the
cortex
.
In
experiments
with
topical
application
of
strychnine
on
the
cerebral
cortex
,
the
transmission
of
impulses
from
the
cortex
to
the
hypothalamus
was
demonstrated
.
Moreover
,
the
responsiveness
of
the
hypothalamus
to
nociceptive
stimulation
is
greatly
increased
under
these
conditions
.
Even
more
complex
and
obviously
cortically
induced
forms
of
emotional
arousal
could
be
elicited
in
monkey
A
on
seeing
monkey
B
(
but
not
a
rabbit
)
in
emotional
stress
.
A
previously
extinguished
conditioned
reaction
was
restored
in
monkey
A
and
was
associated
with
typical
signs
of
emotional
excitement
including
sympathetic
discharges
.
It
seems
to
follow
that
by
and
large
an
antagonism
exists
between
the
paleo-
and
the
neocortex
as
far
as
emotional
reactivity
is
concerned
,
and
that
the
balance
between
the
two
systems
determines
the
emotional
responsiveness
of
the
organism
.
In
addition
,
the
neocortical-hypothalamic
relations
play
a
great
role
in
primates
,
as
Mirsky's
interesting
experiment
on
the
``
communication
of
affect
''
demonstrates
.
But
even
in
relatively
primitive
laboratory
animals
such
as
the
rat
,
sex
activity
closely
identified
with
the
hypothalamus
and
the
visceral
brain
is
enhanced
by
the
neocortex
.
MacLean
stressed
correctly
the
importance
of
the
visceral
brain
for
preservation
of
the
individual
and
the
species
,
as
evidenced
by
the
influence
of
the
limbic
brain
(
including
the
hypothalamus
)
on
emotions
related
to
fight
and
flight
and
also
on
sexual
functions
.
It
should
be
added
that
in
man
neocortical-hypothalamic
interrelations
probably
play
a
role
in
the
fusion
of
emotional
processes
with
those
underlying
perception
,
memory
,
imagination
,
and
creativity
.
Previous
experiences
are
obviously
of
great
importance
for
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
emotional
response
.
The
visceral
brain
as
well
as
the
neocortex
is
known
to
contribute
to
memory
,
but
this
topic
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper
.

Hypothalamic
balance
and
its
significance
After
this
brief
discussion
of
neo-
,
paleocortical
,
and
cortico-hypothalamic
relations
,
let
us
return
once
more
to
the
problem
of
hypothalamic
balance
and
its
physiological
and
pathological
significance
.
Facilitatory
processes
take
place
between
neocortex
and
hypothalamus
via
ascending
and
descending
pathways
.
Thus
cortico-fugal
discharges
induced
by
topical
application
of
strychnine
to
a
minute
area
in
the
neocortex
summate
with
spikes
present
in
the
hypothalamus
and
cause
increased
convulsive
discharges
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
temporary
reduction
in
hypothalamic
excitability
through
the
injection
of
a
barbiturate
into
the
posterior
hypothalamus
causes
a
lessening
in
frequency
and
amplitude
of
cortical
strychnine
spikes
until
the
hypothalamic
excitability
is
restored
.
Apparently
,
a
positive
feedback
exists
between
the
posterior
hypothalamus
and
the
cerebral
cortex
.
Consequently
,
if
for
any
reason
the
hypothalamic
excitability
falls
below
the
physiological
level
,
the
lessened
hypothalamic-cortical
discharges
lead
to
a
diminished
state
of
activity
in
the
cortex
with
consequent
reduction
in
the
cortico-fugal
discharges
.
Obviously
,
a
vicious
cycle
develops
.
This
tendency
can
be
broken
either
by
restoring
hypothalamic
excitability
directly
or
via
cortico-hypothalamic
pathways
.
It
is
believed
that
drug
therapy
and
electroshock
involve
the
former
and
psychotherapy
the
latter
mechanism
.
Before
we
comment
further
on
these
pathological
conditions
,
we
should
remember
that
changes
in
the
state
of
the
hypothalamus
within
physiological
limits
distinguish
sleep
from
wakefulness
.
Thus
,
a
low
intensity
of
hypothalamic-cortical
discharges
prevails
in
sleep
and
a
high
one
during
wakefulness
,
resulting
in
synchronous
EEG
potentials
in
the
former
and
asynchrony
in
the
latter
condition
.
Moreover
,
the
dominance
in
parasympathetic
action
(
with
reciprocal
inhibition
of
the
sympathetic
)
at
the
hypothalamic
level
induces
,
by
its
peripheral
action
,
the
autonomic
symptoms
of
sleep
and
,
by
its
action
on
the
cortex
,
a
lessening
in
the
reactivity
of
the
sensory
and
motor
apparatus
of
the
somatic
nervous
system
.
With
the
dominance
of
the
sympathetic
division
of
the
hypothalamus
,
the
opposite
changes
occur
.
Since
electrical
stimulation
of
the
posterior
hypothalamus
produces
the
effects
of
wakefulness
while
stimulation
of
the
anterior
hypothalamus
induces
sleep
,
it
may
be
said
that
the
reactivity
of
the
whole
organism
is
altered
by
a
change
in
the
autonomic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
.
Similar
effects
can
be
induced
reflexly
via
the
baroreceptor
reflexes
in
man
and
animals
.
Of
particular
importance
is
the
study
of
the
actions
of
drugs
in
this
respect
.
Although
no
drugs
act
exclusively
on
the
hypothalamus
or
a
part
of
it
,
there
is
sufficient
specificity
to
distinguish
drugs
which
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
from
those
which
produce
a
parasympathetic
dominance
.
The
former
comprise
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
,
the
latter
the
tranquilizers
.
Specific
differences
exist
in
the
action
of
different
drugs
belonging
to
the
same
group
as
,
for
instance
,
between
reserpine
and
chlorpromazine
.
Important
as
these
differences
are
,
they
should
not
obscure
the
basic
fact
that
by
shifting
the
hypothalamic
balance
sufficiently
to
the
parasympathetic
side
,
we
produce
depressions
,
whereas
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
causes
excitatory
effects
and
,
eventually
,
maniclike
changes
.
The
emotional
states
produced
by
drugs
influence
the
cortical
potentials
in
a
characteristic
manner
;
;
synchrony
prevails
in
the
EEG
of
the
experimental
animal
after
administration
of
tranquilizers
,
but
asynchrony
after
application
of
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
.
The
shock
therapies
act
likewise
on
the
hypothalamic
balance
.
Physiological
experiments
and
clinical
observations
have
shown
that
these
procedures
influence
the
hypothalamically
controlled
hypophyseal
secretions
and
increase
sympathetic
discharges
.
They
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
.
This
explains
the
beneficial
effect
of
electroshock
therapy
in
certain
depressions
and
a
shift
in
the
reaction
from
hypo-
to
normal
reactivity
of
the
sympathetic
system
as
shown
by
the
Mecholyl
test
.
Some
investigators
have
found
a
parallelism
between
remissions
and
return
of
the
sympathetic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
to
the
normal
level
as
indicated
by
the
Mecholyl
test
and
,
conversely
,
between
clinical
impairment
and
increasing
deviation
of
this
test
from
the
norm
.
Nevertheless
,
the
theory
that
the
determining
influence
of
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
a
profound
influence
on
the
clinical
behavior
of
neuropsychiatric
patients
has
not
yet
been
tested
on
an
adequate
number
of
patients
.
The
Mecholyl
and
noradrenalin
tests
applied
with
certain
precautions
are
reliable
indicators
of
this
central
autonomic
balance
,
but
for
the
sake
of
correlating
autonomic
and
clinical
states
,
and
of
studying
the
effect
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
on
central
autonomic
reactions
,
additional
tests
seem
to
be
desirable
.
It
was
assumed
that
the
shift
in
autonomic
hypothalamic
balance
occurring
spontaneously
in
neuropsychiatric
patients
from
the
application
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
follows
the
pattern
known
from
the
sleep-wakefulness
cycle
.
A
change
in
the
balance
to
the
parasympathetic
side
leads
in
the
normal
individual
to
sleep
or
,
in
special
circumstances
,
to
cardiovascular
collapse
or
nausea
and
vomiting
.
In
both
conditions
the
emotional
and
perceptual
sensitivity
is
diminished
,
but
no
depression
occurs
such
as
is
seen
clinically
or
may
be
produced
in
normal
persons
by
drugs
.
The
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
(
and
also
of
sympathetic
)
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
.
Perhaps
a
clue
to
these
and
related
problems
lies
in
the
fact
that
changes
in
the
intensity
of
hypothalamic
discharges
which
are
associated
with
changes
in
its
balance
lead
also
to
qualitative
alterations
in
reactivity
.
A
state
of
parasympathetic
``
tuning
''
of
the
hypothalamus
induced
experimentally
causes
not
only
an
increase
in
the
parsympathetic
reactivity
of
this
structure
to
direct
and
reflexly
induced
stimuli
,
but
leads
also
to
an
autonomic
reversal
:
a
stimulus
acting
sympathetically
under
control
conditions
elicits
in
this
state
of
tuning
a
parasympathetic
response
!
!
Furthermore
,
conditioned
reactions
are
fundamentally
altered
when
the
hypothalamic
sympathetic
reactivity
is
augmented
beyond
a
critical
level
,
and
several
types
of
behavioral
changes
probably
related
to
the
degree
of
central
autonomic
``
tuning
''
are
observed
.
If
,
for
instance
,
such
a
change
is
produced
by
one
or
a
few
insulin
comas
or
electroshocks
,
previously
inhibited
conditioned
reactions
reappear
.
However
,
if
these
procedures
are
applied
more
often
,
conditioned
emotional
responses
are
temporarily
abolished
.
In
other
studies
,
loss
of
differentiation
in
previously
established
conditioned
reflexes
resulted
from
repeated
convulsive
(
metrazol
)
treatments
,
suggesting
a
fundamental
disturbance
in
the
balance
between
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cerebral
processes
.
It
has
further
been
shown
that
:
(
1
)
an
experimental
neurosis
in
its
initial
stages
is
associated
with
a
reversible
shift
in
the
central
autonomic
balance
;
;
(

)
drugs
altering
the
hypothalamic
balance
alter
conditioned

(

)
in
a
state
of
depression
,
the
positive
conditioned
stimulus
may
fail
to
elicit
a
conditioned
reaction
but
cause
an
increased
synchrony
instead
of
the
excitatory
desynchronizing
(
alerting
)
effect
on
the
Aj
.
These
are
few
and
seemingly
disjointed
data
,
but
they
illustrate
the
important
fact
that
fundamental
alterations
in
conditioned
reactions
occur
in
a
variety
of
states
in
which
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
been
altered
by
physiological
experimentation
,
pharmacological
action
,
or
clinical
processes
.
14
.
On
the
physiological
basis
of
some
form
of
psychotherapy
The
foregoing
remarks
imply
that
the
hypothalamic
balance
plays
a
crucial
role
at
the
crossroads
between
physiological
and
pathological
forms
of
emotion
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
one
would
expect
that
not
only
the
various
procedures
just
mentioned
which
alter
the
hypothalamic
balance
would
influence
emotional
state
and
behavior
but
that
emotion
itself
would
act
likewise
.
We
pointed
out
that
emotional
excitement
may
lead
to
psychosomatic
disorders
and
neurotic
symptoms
,
particularly
in
certain
types
of
personality
,
but
it
is
also
known
that
the
reliving
of
a
strong
emotion
(
``
abreaction
''
)
may
cure
a
battle
neurosis
.
This
phenomenon
raises
the
question
whether
the
guidance
of
the
emotions
for
therapeutic
ends
may
not
have
an
even
wider
application
in
the
area
of
the
neuroses
.
Being
a
strictly
physiological
procedure
,
one
may
expect
from
such
a
study
additional
information
on
the
nature
of
the
emotional
process
itself
.
Wolpe's
experiments
and
therapeutic
work
lie
in
this
area
.
He
showed
convincingly
that
anxiety
is
a
learned
(
conditioned
)
reaction
and
is
the
basis
of
experimental
and
clinical
neuroses
and
assumed
,
therefore
,
that
the
neuronal
changes
which
underlie
the
neuroses
are
functional
and
reversible
.
An
important
observation
of
Pavlov
served
as
a
guide
post
to
achieve
such
a
reversibility
by
physiological
means
.
In
a
conditioning
experiment
,
he
demonstrated
the
antagonism
between
feeding
and
pain
.
A
mild
electrical
shock
served
as
a
conditioned
stimulus
and
was
followed
by
feeding
.
The
pain
became
thus
the
symbol
for
food
and
elicited
salivary
secretion
(
conditioned
reflex
)
.
Even
when
the
intensity
of
the
shocks
was
increased
gradually
,
it
failed
to
evoke
any
signs
of
pain
.
Since
strong
nociceptive
stimuli
produce
an
experimental
neurosis
during
which
the
animals
fail
to
eat
in
the
experimental
situation
,
Wolpe
thought
that
he
could
utilize
the
feeding-pain
antagonism
to
inhibit
the
neurotic
symptoms
through
feeding
.
Appropriate
experiments
showed
that
this
is
,
indeed
,
possible
.
He
then
applied
this
principle
of
reciprocal
inhibition
to
human
neuroses
.
He
took
advantage
of
the
antagonism
between
aggressive
assertiveness
and
anxiety
and
found
a
relatively
rapid
disappearance
of
anxiety
when
the
former
attitude
was
established
.
For
the
interpretation
of
these
significant
investigations
,
it
should
be
remembered
that
reciprocal
relations
exist
in
the
hypothalamus
with
respect
to
autonomic
and
somatic
functions
which
are
closely
associated
with
the
emotions
.
The
feeding-pain
antagonism
seems
to
be
based
on
this
reciprocal
relation
between
the
tropho-
and
ergotropic
systems
.
Furthermore
,
a
functional
antagonism
exists
between
an
aggressive
attitude
and
a
state
of
anxiety
.
Although
in
both
emotions
sympathetic
symptoms
are
present
,
different
autonomic-somatic
patterns
underlie
aggression
and
anxiety
,
respectively
,
as
indicated
by
the
rate
of
the
excretion
of
the
catecholamines
,
the
state
of
the
muscle
tone
,
and
the
Mecholyl
test
.
The
psychological
incompatibility
of
these
emotional
states
seems
to
be
reflected
in
,
or
based
on
,
this
marked
difference
.
15
.
Concluding
remarks
In
our
attempt
to
interpret
the
emotions
in
their
physiological
and
pathological
range
,
we
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
degree
of
activity
of
the
parasympathetic
and
sympathetic
divisions
of
the
hypothalamic
system
and
their
influence
on
the
inhibitory
and
excitatory
systems
,
respectively
.
We
stressed
the
reciprocal
relation
of
these
systems
with
respect
to
the
autonomic-somatic
downward
discharge
as
well
as
regarding
the
hypothalamic-cortical
discharge
.
Although
we
are
still
far
from
a
complete
understanding
of
these
problems
,
as
a
first
approximation
,
it
is
suggested
that
alterations
in
the
hypothalamic
balance
with
consequent
changes
in
the
hypothalamic-cortical
discharges
account
for
major
changes
in
behavior
seen
in
various
moods
and
states
of
emotions
in
man
and
beast
under
physiological
circumstances
,
in
experimental
and
clinical
neurosis
,
and
as
the
result
of
psychopharmacological
agents
.
In
view
of
the
important
role
which
emotional
disturbances
play
in
the
genesis
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
disorders
and
the
parallelism
observed
between
autonomic
states
and
psychological
behavior
in
several
instances
,
it
is
further
suggested
that
a
hypothalamic
imbalance
may
play
an
important
role
in
initiating
mental
changes
.

The
primary
decomposition
theorem
We
are
trying
to
study
a
linear
operator
T
on
the
finite-dimensional
space
V
,
by
decomposing
T
into
a
direct
sum
of
operators
which
are
in
some
sense
elementary
.
We
can
do
this
through
the
characteristic
values
and
vectors
of
T
in
certain
special
cases
,
i.e.
,
when
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
factors
over
the
scalar
field
F
into
a
product
of
distinct
monic
polynomials
of
degree
1
.
What
can
we
do
with
the
general
T
?
?
If
we
try
to
study
T
using
characteristic
values
,
we
are
confronted
with
two
problems
.
First
,
T
may
not
have
a
single
characteristic
value
;
;
this
is
really
a
deficiency
in
the
scalar
field
,
namely
,
that
it
is
not
algebraically
closed
.
Second
,
even
if
the
characteristic
polynomial
factors
completely
over
F
into
a
product
of
polynomials
of
degree
1
,
there
may
not
be
enough
characteristic
vectors
for
T
to
span
the
space
V
.
This
is
clearly
a
deficiency
in
T
.
The
second
situation
is
illustrated
by
the
operator
T
on
Af
(
F
any
field
)
represented
in
the
standard
basis
by
Af
.
The
characteristic
polynomial
for
A
is
Af
and
this
is
plainly
also
the
minimal
polynomial
for
A
(
or
for
T
)
.
Thus
T
is
not
diagonalizable
.
One
sees
that
this
happens
because
the
null
space
of
Af
has
dimension
1
only
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
null
space
of
Af
and
the
null
space
of
Af
together
span
V
,
the
former
being
the
subspace
spanned
by
Af
and
the
latter
the
subspace
spanned
by
Af
and
Af
.
This
will
be
more
or
less
our
general
method
for
the
second
problem
.
If
(
remember
this
is
an
assumption
)
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
decomposes
Af
where
Af
are
distinct
elements
of
F
,
then
we
shall
show
that
the
space
V
is
the
direct
sum
of
the
null
spaces
of
Af
.
The
diagonalizable
operator
is
the
special
case
of
this
in
which
Af
for
each
i
.
The
theorem
which
we
prove
is
more
general
than
what
we
have
described
,
since
it
works
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
the
minimal
polynomial
,
whether
or
not
the
primes
which
enter
are
all
of
first
degree
.
The
reader
will
find
it
helpful
to
think
of
the
special
case
when
the
primes
are
of
degree
1
,
and
even
more
particularly
,
to
think
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
10
,
a
special
case
of
this
theorem
.
Theorem
12
.
(
primary
decomposition
theorem
)
.
Let
T
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
finite-dimensional
vector
space
V
over
the
field
F
.
Let
p
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
,
Af
,
where
the
Af
,
are
distinct
irreducible
monic
polynomials
over
F
and
the
Af
are
positive
integers
.
Let
Af
be
the
null
space
of
Af
.
Then
(
A
)
Af
;
;
(
B
)
each
Af
is
invariant
under
T
;
;
(
C
)
if
Af
is
the
operator
induced
on
Af
by
T
,
then
the
minimal
polynomial
for
Af
is
Af
.
Proof
.
The
idea
of
the
proof
is
this
.
If
the
direct-sum
decomposition
(
A
)
is
valid
,
how
can
we
get
hold
of
the
projections
Af
associated
with
the
decomposition
?
?
The
projection
Af
will
be
the
identity
on
Af
and
zero
on
the
other
Af
.
We
shall
find
a
polynomial
Af
such
that
Af
is
the
identity
on
Af
and
is
zero
on
the
other
Af
,
and
so
that
Af
,
etc.
.
For
each
i
,
let
Af
.
Since
Af
are
distinct
prime
polynomials
,
the
polynomials
Af
are
relatively
prime
(
Theorem
8
,
Chapter
4
)
.
Thus
there
are
polynomials
Af
such
that
Af
.
Note
also
that
if
Af
,
then
Af
is
divisible
by
the
polynomial
p
,
because
Af
contains
each
Af
as
a
factor
.
We
shall
show
that
the
polynomials
Af
behave
in
the
manner
described
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
proof
.
Let
Af
.
Since
Af
and
P
divides
Af
for
Af
,
we
have
Af
.
Thus
the
Af
are
projections
which
correspond
to
some
direct-sum
decomposition
of
the
space
V
.
We
wish
to
show
that
the
range
of
Af
is
exactly
the
subspace
Af
.
It
is
clear
that
each
vector
in
the
range
of
Af
is
in
Af
for
if
**ya
is
in
the
range
of
Af
,
then
Af
and
so
Af
because
Af
is
divisible
by
the
minimal
polynomial
P
.
Conversely
,
suppose
that
**ya
is
in
the
null
space
of
Af
.
If
Af
,
then
Af
is
divisible
by
Af
and
so
Af
,
i.e.
,
Af
.
But
then
it
is
immediate
that
Af
,
i.e.
,
that
**ya
is
in
the
range
of
Af
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
statement
(
A
)
.
It
is
certainly
clear
that
the
subspaces
Af
are
invariant
under
T
.
If
Af
is
the
operator
induced
on
Af
by
T
,
then
evidently
Af
,
because
by
definition
Af
is
0
on
the
subspace
Af
.
This
shows
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
Af
divides
Af
.
Conversely
,
let
G
be
any
polynomial
such
that
Af
.
Then
Af
.
Thus
Af
is
divisible
by
the
minimal
polynomial
P
of
T
,
i.e.
,
Af
divides
Af
.
It
is
easily
seen
that
Af
divides
G
.
Hence
the
minimal
polynomial
for
Af
is
Af
.
Corollary
.
If
Af
are
the
projections
associated
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
T
,
then
each
Af
is
a
polynomial
in
T
,
and
accordingly
if
a
linear
operator
U
commutes
with
T
then
U
commutes
with
each
of
the
Af
,
i.e.
,
each
subspace
Af
is
invariant
under
U
.
In
the
notation
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
12
,
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
special
case
in
which
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
is
a
product
of
first-degree
polynomials
,
i.e.
,
the
case
in
which
each
Af
is
of
the
form
Af
.
Now
the
range
of
Af
is
the
null
space
Af
of
Af
.
Let
us
put
Af
.
By
Theorem
10
,
D
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
we
shall
call
the
diagonalizable
part
of
T
.
Let
us
look
at
the
operator
Af
.
Now
Af
Af
so
Af
.
The
reader
should
be
familiar
enough
with
projections
by
now
so
that
he
sees
that
Af
and
in
general
that
Af
.
When
Af
for
each
i
,
we
shall
have
Af
,
because
the
operator
Af
will
then
be
0
on
the
range
of
Af
.
Definition
.
Let
N
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
vector
space
V
.
We
say
that
N
is
nilpotent
if
there
is
some
positive
integer
R
such
that
Af

Theorem
13
.
Let
T
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
finite-dimensional
vector
space
V
over
the
field
F
.
Suppose
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
decomposes
over
F
into
a
product
of
linear
polynomials
.
Then
there
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
D
on
V
and
a
nilpotent
operator
N
in
V
such
that
(
A
)
Af
,
(
b
)
Af
.
The
diagonalizable
operator
D
and
the
nilpotent
operator
N
are
uniquely
determined
by
(
A
)
and
(
B
)
and
each
of
them
is
a
polynomial
in
T
.
Proof
.
We
have
just
observed
that
we
can
write
Af
where
D
is
diagonalizable
and
N
is
nilpotent
,
and
where
D
and
N
not
only
commute
but
are
polynomials
in
T
.
Now
suppose
that
we
also
have
Af
where
D'
is
diagonalizable
,
N'
is
nilpotent
,
and
Af
.
We
shall
prove
that
Af
.
Since
D'
and
N'
commute
with
one
another
and
Af
,
we
see
that
D'
and
N'
commute
with
T
.
Thus
D'
and
N'
commute
with
any
polynomial
in
T
;
;
hence
they
commute
with
D
and
with
N
.
Now
we
have
Af
or
Af
and
all
four
of
these
operators
commute
with
one
another
.
Since
D
and
D'
are
both
diagonalizable
and
they
commute
,
they
are
simultaneously
diagonalizable
,
and
Af
is
diagonalizable
.
Since
N
and
N'
are
both
nilpotent
and
they
commute
,
the
operator
Af
is
nilpotent
;
;
for
,
using
the
fact
that
N
and
N'
commute
Af
and
so
when
R
is
sufficiently
large
every
term
in
this
expression
for
Af
will
be
0
.
(
Actually
,
a
nilpotent
operator
on
an
n-dimensional
space
must
have
its
T
power
0
;
;
if
we
take
Af
above
,
that
will
be
large
enough
.
It
then
follows
that
Af
is
large
enough
,
but
this
is
not
obvious
from
the
above
expression
.
)
Now
Af
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
is
also
nilpotent
.
Such
an
operator
is
obviously
the
zero
operator
;
;
for
since
it
is
nilpotent
,
the
minimal
polynomial
for
this
operator
is
of
the
form
Af
for
some
Af
;
;
but
then
since
the
operator
is
diagonalizable
,
the
minimal
polynomial
cannot
have
a
repeated
root
;
;
hence
Af
and
the
minimal
polynomial
is
simply
x
,
which
says
the
operator
is
0
.
Thus
we
see
that
Af
and
Af
.
Corollary
.
Let
V
be
a
finite-dimensional
vector
space
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
F
,
e.g.
,
the
field
of
complex
numbers
.
Then
every
linear
operator
T
in
V
can
be
written
as
the
sum
of
a
diagonalizable
operator
D
and
a
nilpotent
operator
N
which
commute
.
These
operators
D
and
N
are
unique
and
each
is
a
polynomial
in
T
.
From
these
results
,
one
sees
that
the
study
of
linear
operators
on
vector
spaces
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
is
essentially
reduced
to
the
study
of
nilpotent
operators
.
For
vector
spaces
over
non-algebraically
closed
fields
,
we
still
need
to
find
some
substitute
for
characteristic
values
and
vectors
.
It
is
a
very
interesting
fact
that
these
two
problems
can
be
handled
simultaneously
and
this
is
what
we
shall
do
in
the
next
chapter
.
In
concluding
this
section
,
we
should
like
to
give
an
example
which
illustrates
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
.
We
have
chosen
to
give
it
at
the
end
of
the
section
since
it
deals
with
differential
equations
and
thus
is
not
purely
linear
algebra
.
Example
11
.
In
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
vector
space
V
be
finite
dimensional
,
nor
is
it
necessary
for
parts
(
A
)
and
(
B
)
that
P
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
.
If
T
is
a
linear
operator
on
an
arbitrary
vector
space
and
if
there
is
a
monic
polynomial
P
such
that
Af
,
then
parts
(
A
)
and
(
B
)
of
Theorem
12
are
valid
for
T
with
the
proof
which
we
gave
.
Let
N
be
a
positive
integer
and
let
V
be
the
space
of
all
N
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
F
on
the
real
line
which
satisfy
the
differential
equation
Af
where
Af
are
some
fixed
constants
.
If
Af
denotes
the
space
of
N
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
,
then
the
space
V
of
solutions
of
this
differential
equation
is
a
subspace
of
Af
.
If
D
denotes
the
differentiation
operator
and
P
is
the
polynomial
Af
then
V
is
the
null
space
of
the
operator
p
(
,
)
,
because
Af
simply
says
Af
.
Let
us
now
regard
D
as
a
linear
operator
on
the
subspace
V
.
Then
Af
.
If
we
are
discussing
differentiable
complex-valued
functions
,
then
Af
and
V
are
complex
vector
spaces
,
and
Af
may
be
any
complex
numbers
.
We
now
write
Af
where
Af
are
distinct
complex
numbers
.
If
Af
is
the
null
space
of
Af
,
then
Theorem
12
says
that
Af
.
In
other
words
,
if
F
satisfies
the
differential
equation
Af
,
then
F
is
uniquely
expressible
in
the
form
Af
where
Af
satisfies
the
differential
equation
Af
.
Thus
,
the
study
of
the
solutions
to
the
equation
Af
is
reduced
to
the
study
of
the
space
of
solutions
of
a
differential
equation
of
the
form
Af
.
This
reduction
has
been
accomplished
by
the
general
methods
of
linear
algebra
,
i.e.
,
by
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
.
To
describe
the
space
of
solutions
to
Af
,
one
must
know
something
about
differential
equations
;
;
that
is
,
one
must
know
something
about
D
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
linear
operator
.
However
,
one
does
not
need
to
know
very
much
.
It
is
very
easy
to
establish
by
induction
on
R
that
if
F
is
in
Af
then
Af
;
;
that
is
,
Af
,
etc.
.
Thus
Af
if
and
only
if
Af
.
A
function
G
such
that
Af
,
i.e.
,
Af
,
must
be
a
polynomial
function
of
degree
Af
or
less
:
Af
.
Thus
F
satisfies
Af
if
and
only
if
F
has
the
form
Af
.
Accordingly
,
the
'
functions
'
Af
span
the
space
of
solutions
of
Af
.
Since
Af
are
linearly
independent
functions
and
the
exponential
function
has
no
zeros
,
these
R
functions
Af
,
form
a
basis
for
the
space
of
solutions
.

Examples
of
binomial
experiments
Some
experiments
are
composed
of
repetitions
of
independent
trials
,
each
with
two
possible
outcomes
.
The
binomial
probability
distribution
may
describe
the
variation
that
occurs
from
one
set
of
trials
of
such
a
binomial
experiment
to
another
.
We
devote
a
chapter
to
the
binomial
distribution
not
only
because
it
is
a
mathematical
model
for
an
enormous
variety
of
real
life
phenomena
,
but
also
because
it
has
important
properties
that
recur
in
many
other
probability
models
.
We
begin
with
a
few
examples
of
binomial
experiments
.
Marksmanship
example
.
A
trained
marksman
shooting
five
rounds
at
a
target
,
all
under
practically
the
same
conditions
,
may
hit
the
bull's-eye
from
0
to
5
times
.
In
repeated
sets
of
five
shots
his
numbers
of
bull's-eyes
vary
.
What
can
we
say
of
the
probabilities
of
the
different
possible
numbers
of
bull's-eyes
?
?
Inheritance
in
mice
.
In
litters
of
eight
mice
from
similar
parents
,
the
number
of
mice
with
straight
instead
of
wavy
hair
is
an
integer
from
0
to
8
.
What
probabilities
should
be
attached
to
these
possible
outcomes
?
?
Aces
(
ones
)
with
three
dice
.
When
three
dice
are
tossed
repeatedly
,
what
is
the
probability
that
the
number
of
aces
is
0
(
or
1
,
or
2
,
or
3
)
?
?
General
binomial
problem
.
More
generally
,
suppose
that
an
experiment
consists
of
a
number
of
independent
trials
,
that
each
trial
results
in
either
a
``
success
''
or
a
``
non-success
''
(
``
failure
''
)
,
and
that
the
probability
of
success
remains
constant
from
trial
to
trial
.
In
the
examples
above
,
the
occurrence
of
a
bull's-eye
,
a
straight-haired
mouse
,
or
an
ace
could
be
called
a
``
success
''
.
In
general
,
any
outcome
we
choose
may
be
labeled
``
success
''
.
The
major
question
in
this
chapter
is
:
What
is
the
probability
of
exactly
X
successes
in
N
trials
?
?
In
Chapters
3
and
4
we
answered
questions
like
those
in
the
examples
,
usually
by
counting
points
in
a
sample
space
.
Fortunately
,
a
general
formula
of
wide
applicability
solves
all
problems
of
this
kind
.
Before
deriving
this
formula
,
we
explain
what
we
mean
by
``
problems
of
this
kind
''
.
Experiments
are
often
composed
of
several
identical
trials
,
and
sometimes
experiments
themselves
are
repeated
.
In
the
marksmanship
example
,
a
trial
consists
of
``
one
round
shot
at
a
target
''
with
outcome
either
one
bull's-eye
(
success
)
or
none
(
failure
)
.
Further
,
an
experiment
might
consist
of
five
rounds
,
and
several
sets
of
five
rounds
might
be
regarded
as
a
super-experiment
composed
of
several
repetitions
of
the
five-round
experiment
.
If
three
dice
are
tossed
,
a
trial
is
one
toss
of
one
die
and
the
experiment
is
composed
of
three
trials
.
Or
,
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
,
if
one
die
is
tossed
three
times
,
each
toss
is
a
trial
,
and
the
three
tosses
form
the
experiment
.
Mathematically
,
we
shall
not
distinguish
the
experiment
of
three
dice
tossed
once
from
that
of
one
die
tossed
three
times
.
These
examples
are
illustrative
of
the
use
of
the
words
``
trial
''
and
``
experiment
''
as
they
are
used
in
this
chapter
,
but
they
are
quite
flexible
words
and
it
is
well
not
to
restrict
them
too
narrowly
.
Example
1
.
Student
football
managers
.
Ten
students
act
as
managers
for
a
high-school
football
team
,
and
of
these
managers
a
proportion
P
are
licensed
drivers
.
Each
Friday
one
manager
is
chosen
by
lot
to
stay
late
and
load
the
equipment
on
a
truck
.
On
three
Fridays
the
coach
has
needed
a
driver
.
Considering
only
these
Fridays
,
what
is
the
probability
that
the
coach
had
drivers
all
3
times
?
?
Exactly
2
times
?
?
1
time
?
?
0
times
?
?
Discussion
.
Note
that
there
are
3
trials
of
interest
.
Each
trial
consists
of
choosing
a
student
manager
at
random
.
The
2
possible
outcomes
on
each
trial
are
``
driver
''
or
``
nondriver
''
.
Since
the
choice
is
by
lot
each
week
,
the
outcomes
of
different
trials
are
independent
.
The
managers
stay
the
same
,
so
that
Af
is
the
same
for
all
weeks
.
We
now
generalize
these
ideas
for
general
binomial
experiments
.
For
an
experiment
to
qualify
as
a
binomial
experiment
,
it
must
have
four
properties
:
(
1
)
there
must
be
a
fixed
number
of
trials
,
(
2
)
each
trial
must
result
in
a
``
success
''
or
a
``
failure
''
(
a
binomial
trial
)
,
(
3
)
all
trials
must
have
identical
probabilities
of
success
,
(
4
)
the
trials
must
be
independent
of
each
other
.
Below
we
use
our
earlier
examples
to
describe
and
illustrate
these
four
properties
.
We
also
give
,
for
each
property
,
an
example
where
the
property
is
absent
.
The
language
and
notation
introduced
are
standard
throughout
the
chapter
.
1
.
There
must
be
a
fixed
number
n
of
repeated
trials
.
For
the
marksman
,
we
study
sets
of
five
shots
(
Af
)
;
;
for
the
mice
,
we
restrict
attention
to
litters
of
eight
(
Af
)
;
;
and
for
the
aces
,
we
toss
three
dice
(
Af
)
.
Experiment
without
a
fixed
number
of
trials
.
Toss
a
die
until
an
ace
appears
.
Here
the
number
of
trials
is
a
random
variable
,
not
a
fixed
number
.
2
.
Binomial
trials
.
Each
of
the
N
trials
is
either
a
success
or
a
failure
.
``
Success
''
and
``
failure
''
are
just
convenient
labels
for
the
two
categories
of
outcomes
when
we
talk
about
binomial
trials
in
general
.
These
words
are
more
expressive
than
labels
like
``
A
''
and
``
not-A
''
.
It
is
natural
from
the
marksman's
viewpoint
to
call
a
bull's-eye
a
success
,
but
in
the
mice
example
it
is
arbitrary
which
category
corresponds
to
straight
hair
in
a
mouse
.
The
word
``
binomial
''
means
``
of
two
names
''
or
``
of
two
terms
''
,
and
both
usages
apply
in
our
work
:
the
first
to
the
names
of
the
two
outcomes
of
a
binomial
trial
,
and
the
second
to
the
terms
P
and
Af
that
represent
the
probabilities
of
``
success
''
and
``
failure
''
.
Sometimes
when
there
are
many
outcomes
for
a
single
trial
,
we
group
these
outcomes
into
two
classes
,
as
in
the
example
of
the
die
,
where
we
have
arbitrarily
constructed
the
classes
``
ace
''
and
``
not-ace
''
.
Experiment
without
the
two-class
property
.
We
classify
mice
as
``
straight-haired
''
or
``
wavy-haired
''
,
but
a
hairless
mouse
appears
.
We
can
escape
from
such
a
difficulty
by
ruling
out
the
animal
as
not
constituting
a
trial
,
but
such
a
solution
is
not
always
satisfactory
.
3
.
All
trials
have
identical
probabilities
of
success
.
Each
die
has
probability
Af
of
producing
an
ace
;
;
the
marksman
has
some
probability
p
,
perhaps
0.1
,
of
making
a
bull's-eye
.
Note
that
we
need
not
know
the
value
of
p
,
for
the
experiment
to
be
binomial
.
Experiment
where
p
is
not
constant
.
During
a
round
of
target
practice
the
sun
comes
from
behind
a
cloud
and
dazzles
the
marksman
,
lowering
his
chance
of
a
bull's-eye
.
4
.
The
trials
are
independent
.
Strictly
speaking
,
this
means
that
the
probability
for
each
possible
outcome
of
the
experiment
can
be
computed
by
multiplying
together
the
probabilities
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
single
binomial
trials
.
Thus
in
the
three-dice
example
Af
,
Af
,
and
the
independence
assumption
imply
that
the
probability
that
the
three
dice
fall
ace
,
not-ace
,
ace
in
that
order
is
Af
.
Experimentally
,
we
expect
independence
when
the
trials
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
.
Examples
where
independence
fails
.
A
family
of
five
plans
to
go
together
either
to
the
beach
or
to
the
mountains
,
and
a
coin
is
tossed
to
decide
.
We
want
to
know
the
number
of
people
going
to
the
mountains
.
When
this
experiment
is
viewed
as
composed
of
five
binomial
trials
,
one
for
each
member
of
the
family
,
the
outcomes
of
the
trials
are
obviously
not
independent
.
Indeed
,
the
experiment
is
better
viewed
as
consisting
of
one
binomial
trial
for
the
entire
family
.
The
following
is
a
less
extreme
example
of
dependence
.
Consider
couples
visiting
an
art
museum
.
Each
person
votes
for
one
of
a
pair
of
pictures
to
receive
a
popular
prize
.
Voting
for
one
picture
may
be
called
``
success
''
,
for
the
other
``
failure
''
.
An
experiment
consists
of
the
voting
of
one
couple
,
or
two
trials
.
In
repetitions
of
the
experiment
from
couple
to
couple
,
the
votes
of
the
two
persons
in
a
couple
probably
agree
more
often
than
independence
would
imply
,
because
couples
who
visit
the
museum
together
are
more
likely
to
have
similar
tastes
than
are
a
random
pair
of
people
drawn
from
the
entire
population
of
visitors
.
Table
7-1
illustrates
the
point
.
The
table
shows
that
0.6
of
the
boys
and
0.6
of
the
girls
vote
for
picture
A
.
Therefore
,
under
independent
voting
,
Af
or
0.36
of
the
couples
would
cast
two
votes
for
picture
A
,
and
Af
or
0.16
would
cast
two
votes
for
picture
B
.
Thus
in
independent
voting
,
Af
or
0.52
of
the
couples
would
agree
.
But
Table
7-1
shows
that
Af
or
0.70
agree
,
too
many
for
independent
voting
.
Each
performance
of
an
n-trial
binomial
experiment
results
in
some
whole
number
from
0
through
N
as
the
value
of
the
random
variable
X
,
where
Af
.
We
want
to
study
the
probability
function
of
this
random
variable
.
For
example
,
we
are
interested
in
the
number
of
bull's-eyes
,
not
which
shots
were
bull's-eyes
.
A
binomial
experiment
can
produce
random
variables
other
than
the
number
of
successes
.
For
example
,
the
marksman
gets
5
shots
,
but
we
take
his
score
to
be
the
number
of
shots
before
his
first
bull's-eye
,
that
is
,
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
(
or
5
,
if
he
gets
no
bull's-eye
)
.
Thus
we
do
not
score
the
number
of
bull's-eyes
,
and
the
random
variable
is
not
the
number
of
successes
.
The
constancy
of
P
and
the
independence
are
the
conditions
most
likely
to
give
trouble
in
practice
.
Obviously
,
very
slight
changes
in
P
do
not
change
the
probabilities
much
,
and
a
slight
lack
of
independence
may
not
make
an
appreciable
difference
.
(
For
instance
,
see
Example
2
of
Section
5-5
,
on
red
cards
in
hands
of
5
.
)
On
the
other
hand
,
even
when
the
binomial
model
does
not
describe
well
the
physical
phenomenon
being
studied
,
the
binomial
model
may
still
be
used
as
a
baseline
for
comparative
purposes
;
;
that
is
,
we
may
discuss
the
phenomenon
in
terms
of
its
departures
from
the
binomial
model
.
To
summarize
:
A
binomial
experiment
consists
of
Af
independent
binomial
trials
,
all
with
the
same
probability
Af
of
yielding
a
success
.
The
outcome
of
the
experiment
is
X
successes
.
The
random
variable
X
takes
the
values
Af
with
probabilities
Af
or
,
more
briefly
Af
.
We
shall
find
a
formula
for
the
probability
of
exactly
X
successes
for
given
values
of
P
and
N
.
When
each
number
of
successes
X
is
paired
with
its
probability
of
occurrence
Af
,
the
set
of
pairs
Af
,
is
a
probability
function
called
a
binomial
distribution
.
The
choice
of
P
and
N
determines
the
binomial
distribution
uniquely
,
and
different
choices
always
produce
different
distributions
(
except
when
Af
;
;
then
the
number
of
successes
is
always
0
)
.
The
set
of
all
binomial
distributions
is
called
the
family
of
binomial
distributions
,
but
in
general
discussions
this
expression
is
often
shortened
to
``
the
binomial
distribution
''
,
or
even
``
the
binomial
''
when
the
context
is
clear
.
Binomial
distributions
were
treated
by
James
Bernoulli
about
1700
,
and
for
this
reason
binomial
trials
are
sometimes
called
Bernoulli
trials
.
Random
variables
.
Each
binomial
trial
of
a
binomial
experiment
produces
either
0
or
1
success
.
Therefore
each
binomial
trial
can
be
thought
of
as
producing
a
value
of
a
random
variable
associated
with
that
trial
and
taking
the
values
0
and
1
,
with
probabilities
Q
and
P
respectively
.
The
several
trials
of
a
binomial
experiment
produce
a
new
random
variable
X
,
the
total
number
of
successes
,
which
is
just
the
sum
of
the
random
variables
associated
with
the
single
trials
.

.
The
marksman
gets
two
bull's-eyes
,
one
on
his
third
shot
and
one
on
his
fifth
.
The
numbers
of
successes
on
the
five
individual
shots
are
,
then
,
0
,
0
,
1
,
0
,
1
.
The
number
of
successes
on
each
shot
is
a
value
of
a
random
variable
that
has
values
0
or
1
,
and
there
are
5
such
random
variables
here
.
Their
sum
is
X
,
the
total
number
of
successes
,
which
in
this
experiment
has
the
value
Af
.
Consider
a
simple
,
closed
,
plane
curve
C
which
is
a
real-analytic
image
of
the
unit
circle
,
and
which
is
given
by
Af
.
These
are
real
analytic
periodic
functions
with
period
T
.
In
the
following
paper
it
is
shown
that
in
a
certain
definite
sense
,
exactly
an
odd
number
of
squares
can
be
inscribed
in
every
such
curve
which
does
not
contain
an
infinite
number
of
inscribed
squares
.
This
theorem
is
similar
to
the
theorem
of
Kakutani
that
there
exists
a
circumscribing
cube
around
any
closed
,
bounded
convex
set
in
Af
.
The
latter
theorem
has
been
generalized
by
Yamabe
and
Yujobo
,
and
Cairns
to
show
that
in
Af
there
are
families
of
such
cubes
.
Here
,
for
the
case
of
squares
inscribed
in
plane
curves
,
we
remove
the
restriction
to
convexity
and
give
certain
other
results
.
A
square
inscribed
in
a
curve
C
means
a
square
with
its
four
corner
points
on
the
curve
,
though
it
may
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
of
C
.
Indeed
,
the
spiral
Af
,
with
the
two
endpoints
connected
by
a
straight
line
possesses
only
one
inscribed
square
.
The
square
has
one
corner
point
on
the
straight
line
segment
,
and
does
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
.
On
C
,
from
the
point
P
at
Af
to
the
point
Q
at
Af
,
we
construct
the
chord
,
and
upon
the
chord
as
a
side
erect
a
square
in
such
a
way
that
as
S
approaches
zero
the
square
is
inside
C
.
As
S
increases
we
consider
the
two
free
corner
points
of
the
square
,
Af
and
Af
,
adjacent
to
P
and
Q
respectively
.
As
S
approaches
T
the
square
will
be
outside
C
and
therefore
both
Af
and
Af
must
cross
C
an
odd
number
of
times
as
S
varies
from
zero
to
T
.
The
points
may
also
touch
C
without
crossing
.
Suppose
Af
crosses
C
when
Af
.
We
now
have
certain
squares
with
three
corners
on
C
.
For
any
such
square
the
middle
corner
of
these
will
be
called
the
vertex
of
the
square
and
the
corner
not
on
the
curve
will
be
called
the
diagonal
point
of
the
square
.
Each
point
on
C
,
as
a
vertex
,
may
possess
a
finite
number
of
corresponding
diagonal
points
by
the
above
construction
.
To
each
paired
vertex
and
diagonal
point
there
corresponds
a
unique
forward
corner
point
,
i.e.
,
the
corner
on
C
reached
first
by
proceeding
along
C
from
the
vertex
in
the
direction
of
increasing
T
.
If
the
vertex
is
at
Af
,
and
if
the
interior
of
C
is
on
the
left
as
one
moves
in
the
direction
of
increasing
t
,
then
every
such
corner
can
be
found
from
the
curve
obtained
by
rotating
C
clockwise
through
90-degrees
about
the
vertex
.
The
set
of
intersections
of
Af
,
the
rotated
curve
,
with
the
original
curve
C
consists
of
just
the
set
of
forward
corner
points
on
C
corresponding
to
the
vertex
at
Af
,
plus
the
vertex
itself
.
We
note
that
two
such
curves
C
and
Af
,
cannot
coincide
at
more
than
a
finite
number
of
points
;
;
otherwise
,
being
analytic
,
they
would
coincide
at
all
points
,
which
is
impossible
since
they
do
not
coincide
near
Af
.
With
each
vertex
we
associate
certain
numerical
values
,
namely
the
set
of
positive
differences
in
the
parameter
T
between
the
vertex
and
its
corresponding
forward
corner
points
.
For
the
vertex
at
Af
,
these
values
will
be
denoted
by
Af
.
The
function
f{t}
defined
in
this
way
is
multi-valued
.
We
consider
now
the
graph
of
the
function
f{t}
on
Af
.
We
will
refer
to
the
plane
of
C
and
Af
as
the
C-plane
and
to
the
plane
of
the
graph
as
the
Aj
.
The
graph
,
as
a
set
,
may
have
a
finite
number
of
components
.
We
will
denote
the
values
of
f{t}
on
different
components
by
Af
.
Each
point
with
abscissa
T
on
the
graph
represents
an
intersection
between
C
and
Af
.
There
are
two
types
of
such
intersections
,
depending
essentially
on
whether
the
curves
cross
at
the
point
of
intersection
.
An
ordinary
point
will
be
any
point
of
intersection
A
such
that
in
every
neighborhood
of
A
in
the
C-plane
,
Af
meets
both
the
interior
and
the
exterior
of
C
.
Any
other
point
of
intersection
between
C
and
Af
will
be
called
a
tangent
point
.
This
terminology
will
also
be
applied
to
the
corresponding
points
in
the
Aj
.
We
can
now
prove
several
lemmas
.
Lemma
1
.
In
some
neighborhood
in
the
f-plane
of
any
ordinary
point
of
the
graph
,
the
function
f
is
a
single-valued
,
continuous
function
.
Proof
.
We
first
show
that
the
function
is
single-valued
in
some
neighborhood
.
With
the
vertex
at
Af
in
the
C-plane
we
assume
that
Af
is
the
parametric
location
on
C
of
an
ordinary
intersection
Q
between
C
and
Af
.
In
the
f-plane
the
coordinates
of
the
corresponding
point
are
Af
.
We
know
that
in
the
C-plane
both
C
and
Af
are
analytic
.
In
the
C-plane
we
construct
a
set
of
rectangular
Cartesian
coordinates
u
,
V
with
the
origin
at
Q
and
such
that
both
C
and
Af
have
finite
slope
at
Q
.
Near
Q
,
both
curves
can
be
represented
by
analytic
functions
of
U
.
In
a
neighborhood
of
Q
the
difference
between
these
functions
is
also
a
single-valued
,
analytic
function
of
U
.
Furthermore
,
one
can
find
a
neighborhood
of
Q
in
which
the
difference
function
is
monotone
,
for
since
it
is
analytic
it
can
have
only
a
finite
number
of
extrema
in
any
interval
.
Now
,
to
find
Af
,
one
needs
the
intersection
of
C
and
Af
near
Q
.
But
Af
is
just
the
curve
Af
translated
without
rotation
through
a
small
arc
,
for
Af
is
always
obtained
by
rotating
C
through
exactly
90-degrees
.
The
arc
is
itself
a
segment
of
an
analytic
curve
.
Thus
if
E
is
sufficiently
small
,
there
can
be
only
one
intersection
of
C
and
Af
near
Q
,
for
if
there
were
more
than
one
intersection
for
every
E
then
the
difference
between
C
and
Af
near
Q
would
not
be
a
monotone
function
.
Therefore
,
Af
is
single-valued
near
Q
.
It
is
also
seen
that
Af
,
since
the
change
from
Af
to
Af
is
accomplished
by
a
continuous
translation
.
Thus
Af
is
also
continuous
at
Af
,
and
in
a
neighborhood
of
Af
which
does
not
contain
a
tangent
point
.
We
turn
now
to
the
set
of
tangent
points
on
the
graph
.
This
set
must
consist
of
isolated
points
and
closed
intervals
.
The
fact
that
there
can
not
be
any
limit
points
of
the
set
except
in
closed
intervals
follows
from
the
argument
used
in
Lemma
1
,
namely
,
that
near
any
tangent
point
in
the
C-plane
the
curves
C
and
Af
are
analytic
,
and
therefore
the
difference
between
them
must
be
a
monotone
function
in
some
neighborhood
on
either
side
of
the
tangent
point
.
This
prevents
the
occurrence
of
an
infinite
sequence
of
isolated
tangent
points
.
Lemma
2
.
In
some
neighborhood
of
an
isolated
tangent
point
in
the
f-plane
,
say
Af
,
the
function
Af
is
either
double-valued
or
has
no
values
defined
,
except
at
the
tangent
point
itself
,
where
it
is
single-valued
.
Proof
.
A
tangent
point
Q
in
the
C-plane
occurs
when
C
and
Af
are
tangent
to
one
another
.
A
continuous
change
in
T
through
an
amount
E
results
in
a
translation
along
an
analytic
arc
of
the
curve
Af
.
There
are
three
possibilities
:
(
A
)
Af
remains
tangent
to
C
as
it
is
translated
;
;
(
B
)
Af
moves
away
from
C
and
does
not
intersect
it
at
all
for
Af
;
;
(
C
)
Af
cuts
across
C
and
there
are
two
ordinary
intersections
for
every
T
in
Af
.
The
first
possibility
results
in
a
closed
interval
of
tangent
points
in
the
f-plane
,
the
end
points
of
which
fall
into
category
(
B
)
or
(
C
)
.
In
the
second
category
the
function
Af
has
no
values
defined
in
a
neighborhood
Af
.
In
the
third
category
the
function
is
double-valued
in
this
interval
.
The
same
remarks
apply
to
an
interval
on
the
other
side
of
Af
.
Again
,
the
analyticity
of
the
two
curves
guarantees
that
such
intervals
exist
.
In
the
neighborhood
of
an
end
point
of
an
interval
of
tangent
points
in
the
f-plane
the
function
is
two-valued
or
no-valued
on
one
side
,
and
is
a
single-valued
function
consisting
entirely
of
tangent
points
on
the
other
side
.
With
the
above
results
we
can
make
the
following
remarks
about
the
graph
of
F
.
First
,
for
any
value
of
T
for
which
all
values
of
f{t}
are
ordinary
points
the
number
of
values
of
f{t}
must
be
odd
.
For
it
is
clear
that
the
total
number
of
ordinary
intersections
of
C
and
Af
must
be
even
(
otherwise
,
starting
in
the
interior
of
C
,
Af
could
not
finally
return
to
the
interior
)
,
and
the
center
of
rotation
at
T
is
the
argument
of
the
function
,
not
a
value
.
Therefore
,
for
any
value
of
T
the
number
of
values
of
f{t}
is
equal
to
the
(
finite
)
number
of
tangent
points
corresponding
to
the
argument
T
plus
an
odd
number
.
Definition
.
The
number
of
ordinary
values
of
the
function
f{t}
at
T
will
be
called
its
multiplicity
at
T
.
Lemma
3
.
The
graph
of
f
has
at
least
one
component
whose
support
is
the
entire
interval
Aj
.
Proof
.
We
suppose
not
.
Then
every
component
of
the
graph
of
F
must
be
defined
over
a
bounded
sub-interval
.
Suppose
Af
is
defined
in
the
sub-interval
Af
.
Now
Af
and
Af
must
both
be
tangent
points
on
the
T
component
in
the
f-plane
;
;
otherwise
by
Lemma
1
the
component
would
extend
beyond
these
points
.
Further
,
we
see
by
Lemma
2
that
the
multiplicity
of
F
can
only
change
at
a
tangent
point
,
and
at
such
a
point
can
only
change
by
an
even
integer
.
Thus
the
multiplicity
of
Af
for
a
given
T
must
be
an
even
number
.
This
is
true
of
all
components
which
have
such
a
bounded
support
.
But
this
is
a
contradiction
,
for
we
know
that
the
multiplicity
of
f{t}
is
odd
for
every
T
.
We
have
shown
that
the
graph
of
F
contains
at
least
one
component
whose
inverse
is
the
entire
interval
{0,T}
,
and
whose
multiplicity
is
odd
.
There
must
be
an
odd
number
of
such
components
,
which
will
be
called
complete
components
.
The
remaining
(
incomplete
)
components
all
have
an
even
number
of
ordinary
points
at
any
argument
,
and
are
defined
only
on
a
proper
sub-interval
of
Aj
.
We
must
now
show
that
on
some
component
of
the
graph
there
exist
two
points
for
which
the
corresponding
diagonal
points
in
the
C-plane
are
on
opposite
sides
of
C
.
We
again
consider
a
fixed
point
P
at
Af
and
a
variable
point
Q
at
Af
on
C
.
We
erect
a
square
with
PQ
as
a
side
and
with
free
corners
Af
and
Af
adjacent
to
P
and
Q
respectively
.
As
S
varies
from
zero
to
T
,
the
values
of
S
for
which
Af
and
Af
cross
C
will
be
denoted
by
Af
and
Af
respectively
.
We
have
Af
,
plus
tangent
points
.
These
s-values
are
just
the
ordinary
values
of
Af
.
Lemma
4
.
The
values
Af
are
the
ordinary
values
at
Af
of
a
multi-valued
function
g{t}
which
has
components
corresponding
to
those
of
f{t}
.
Proof
.
We
first
define
a
function
b{t}
as
follows
:
given
the
set
of
squares
such
that
each
has
three
corners
on
C
and
vertex
at
t
,
b{t}
is
the
corresponding
set
of
positive
parametric
differences
between
T
and
the
backward
corner
points
.
The
functions
F
and
B
have
exactly
the
same
multiplicity
at
every
argument
T
.
Now
with
P
fixed
at
Af
,
Af-values
occur
when
the
corner
Af
crosses
C
,
and
are
among
the
values
of
S
such
that
Af
.
The
roots
of
this
equation
are
just
the
ordinates
of
the
intersections
of
the
graph
of
B
with
a
straight
line
of
unit
slope
through
Af
in
the
b-plane
(
the
plane
of
the
graph
of
b
)
.
We
define
these
values
as
Af
,
and
define
g{t}
in
the
same
way
for
each
T
.
Thus
we
obtain
g{t}
by
introducing
an
oblique
g{t}-axis
in
the
Aj
.
Introduction
.
In
1
we
investigate
a
new
series
of
line
involutions
in
a
projective
space
of
three
dimensions
over
the
field
of
complex
numbers
.
These
are
defined
by
a
simple
involutorial
transformation
of
the
points
in
which
a
general
line
meets
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
a
curve
of
symbol
Af
.
Then
in
2
we
show
that
any
line
involution
with
the
properties
that
(
A
)
It
has
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
and
(
B
)
Its
singular
lines
form
a
complex
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
,
is
necessarily
of
the
type
discussed
in
1
.
No
generalization
of
these
results
to
spaces
of
more
than
three
dimensions
has
so
far
been
found
possible
.
1
.
Let
Q
be
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
reguli
Af
and
Af
,
and
let
**zg
be
a
Af
curve
of
order
K
on
Q
.
A
general
line
L
meets
Q
in
two
points
,
Af
and
Af
,
through
each
of
which
passes
a
unique
generator
of
the
regulus
,
Af
,
whose
lines
are
simple
secants
of
Aj
.
On
these
generators
let
Af
and
Af
be
,
respectively
,
the
harmonic
conjugates
of
Af
and
Af
with
respect
to
the
two
points
in
which
the
corresponding
generator
meets
Aj
.
The
line
Af
is
the
image
of
L
.
Clearly
,
the
transformation
is
involutorial
.
We
observe
first
that
no
line
,
l
,
can
meet
its
image
except
at
one
of
its
intersections
with
Q
.
For
if
it
did
,
the
plane
of
L
and
l'
would
contain
two
generators
of
Af
,
which
is
impossible
.
Moreover
,
from
the
definitive
transformation
of
intercepts
on
the
generators
of
Af
,
it
is
clear
that
the
only
points
of
Q
at
which
a
line
can
meet
its
image
are
the
points
of
Aj
.
Hence
the
totality
of
singular
lines
is
the
T
order
complex
of
lines
which
meet
Aj
.
The
invariant
lines
are
the
lines
of
the
congruence
of
secants
of
**zg
,
since
each
of
these
meets
Q
in
two
points
which
are
invariant
.
The
order
of
this
congruence
is
Af
,
since
Af
secants
of
a
curve
of
symbol
(
B
)
on
a
quadric
surface
pass
through
an
arbitrary
point
.
The
class
of
the
congruence
is
Af
,
since
an
arbitrary
plane
meets
**zg
in
K
points
.
Since
the
complex
of
singular
lines
is
of
order
K
and
since
there
is
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
it
follows
from
the
formula
Af
that
the
order
of
the
involution
is
Af
.
There
are
various
sets
of
exceptional
lines
,
or
lines
whose
images
are
not
unique
.
The
most
obvious
of
these
is
the
quadratic
complex
of
tangents
to
Q
,
each
line
of
which
is
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
of
lines
tangent
to
Q
at
the
image
of
the
point
of
tangency
of
the
given
line
.
Thus
pencils
of
tangents
to
Q
are
transformed
into
pencils
of
tangents
.
It
is
interesting
that
a
1
:
1
correspondence
can
be
established
between
the
lines
of
two
such
pencils
,
so
that
in
a
sense
a
unique
image
can
actually
be
assigned
to
each
tangent
.
For
the
lines
of
any
plane
,
**yp
,
meeting
Q
in
a
conic
C
,
are
transformed
into
the
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
C'
into
which
C
is
transformed
in
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
In
particular
,
tangents
to
C
are
transformed
into
tangents
to
C'
.
Moreover
,
if
Af
and
Af
are
two
planes
intersecting
in
a
line
l
,
tangent
to
Q
at
a
point
P
,
the
two
free
intersections
of
the
image
curves
Af
and
Af
must
coincide
at
P'
,
the
image
of
P
,
and
at
this
point
Af
and
Af
must
have
a
common
tangent
l'
.
Hence
,
thought
of
as
a
line
in
a
particular
plane
**yp
,
any
tangent
to
Q
has
a
unique
image
and
moreover
this
image
is
the
same
for
all
planes
through
L
.
Each
generator
,
**yl
,
of
Af
is
also
exceptional
,
for
each
is
transformed
into
the
entire
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
into
which
that
generator
is
transformed
by
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
This
curve
is
of
symbol
Af
since
it
meets
**yl
,
and
hence
every
line
of
Af
in
the
Af
invariant
points
on
**yl
and
since
it
obviously
meets
every
line
of
Af
in
a
single
point
.
The
congruence
of
its
secants
is
therefore
of
order
Af
and
class
Af
.
A
final
class
of
exceptional
lines
is
identifiable
from
the
following
considerations
:
Since
no
two
generators
of
Af
can
intersect
,
it
follows
that
their
image
curves
can
have
no
free
intersections
.
In
other
words
,
these
curves
have
only
fixed
intersections
common
to
them
all
.
Now
the
only
way
in
which
all
curves
of
the
image
family
of
Af
can
pass
through
a
fixed
point
is
to
have
a
generator
of
Af
which
is
not
a
secant
but
a
tangent
of
**zg
,
for
then
any
point
on
such
a
generator
will
be
transformed
into
the
point
of
tangency
.
Since
two
curves
of
symbol
Af
on
Q
intersect
in
Af
points
,
it
follows
that
there
are
Af
lines
of
Af
which
are
tangent
to
Aj
.
Clearly
,
any
line
,
l
,
of
any
bundle
having
one
of
these
points
of
tangency
,
T
,
as
vertex
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
having
the
image
of
the
second
intersection
of
L
and
Q
as
vertex
and
lying
in
the
plane
determined
by
the
image
point
and
the
generator
of
Af
which
is
tangent
to
**zg
at
T
.
A
line
through
two
of
these
points
,
Af
and
Af
,
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
bilinear
congruence
having
the
tangents
to
**zg
at
Af
and
Af
as
directrices
.
A
conic
,
C
,
being
a
(
1
,
1
)
curve
on
Q
,
meets
the
image
of
any
line
of
Af
,
which
we
have
already
found
to
be
a
Af
curve
on
Q
,
in
Af
points
.
Hence
its
image
,
C'
,
meets
any
line
of
Af
in
Af
points
.
Moreover
,
C'
obviously
meets
any
line
Af
in
a
single
point
.
Hence
C'
is
a
Af
curve
on
Q
.
Therefore
,
the
congruence
of
its
secants
,
that
is
the
image
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
is
of
order
Af
and
class
Af
.
Finally
,
the
image
of
a
general
bundle
of
lines
is
a
congruence
whose
order
is
the
order
of
the
congruence
of
invariant
lines
,
namely
Af
and
whose
class
is
the
order
of
the
image
congruence
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
namely
Af
.

.
The
preceding
observations
make
it
clear
that
there
exist
line
involutions
of
all
orders
greater
than
1
with
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
with
a
complex
of
singular
lines
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
Aj
.
We
now
shall
show
that
any
involution
with
these
characteristics
is
necessarily
of
the
type
we
have
just
described
.
To
do
this
we
must
first
show
that
every
line
which
meets
**zg
in
a
point
P
meets
its
image
at
P
.
To
see
this
,
consider
a
general
pencil
of
lines
containing
a
general
secant
of
Aj
.
By
(
1
)
,
the
image
of
this
pencil
is
a
ruled
surface
of
order
Af
which
is
met
by
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
a
curve
,
C
,
of
order
Af
.
On
C
there
is
a
Af
correspondence
in
which
the
Af
points
cut
from
C
by
a
general
line
,
l
,
of
the
pencil
correspond
to
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
image
of
L
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
.
Since
C
is
rational
,
this
correspondence
has
K
coincidences
,
each
of
which
implies
a
line
of
the
pencil
which
meets
its
image
.
However
,
since
the
pencil
contains
a
secant
of
**zg
it
actually
contains
only
Af
singular
lines
.
To
avoid
this
contradiction
it
is
necessary
that
C
be
composite
,
with
the
secant
of
**zg
and
a
curve
of
order
Af
as
components
.
Thus
it
follows
that
the
secants
of
**zg
are
all
invariant
.
But
if
this
is
the
case
,
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having
a
point
,
P
,
of
**zg
as
vertex
is
transformed
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
Af
having
Af
generators
concurrent
at
P
.
Since
a
ruled
surface
of
order
N
with
N
concurrent
generators
is
necessarily
a
cone
,
it
follows
finally
that
every
line
through
a
point
,
P
,
of
**zg
meets
its
image
at
P
,
as
asserted
.
Now
consider
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
,
P
,
on
**zg
which
is
effected
by
the
involution
as
a
whole
.
From
the
preceding
remarks
,
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
.
Moreover
,
in
this
involution
there
is
a
cone
of
invariant
lines
of
order
Af
,
namely
the
cone
of
secants
of
**zg
which
pass
through
P
.
Hence
it
follows
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be
a
perspective
De
Jonquieres
involution
of
order
Af
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
Af
or
Af
.
The
first
possibility
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
**zg
in
Af
points
;
;
the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
**zg
in
Af
points
.
In
each
case
,
lines
of
the
bundles
are
transformed
by
involutions
within
the
pencils
they
determine
with
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
first
case
the
fixed
elements
within
each
pencil
are
the
multiple
secant
and
the
line
joining
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
intersection
of
**zg
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
does
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
second
,
the
fixed
elements
are
the
lines
which
join
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
two
intersections
of
**zg
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
do
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
.
The
multiple
secants
,
of
course
,
are
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed
into
cones
of
order
Af
.
Observations
similar
to
these
can
be
made
at
each
point
of
Aj
.
Hence
**zg
must
have
either
a
regulus
of
Af-fold
secants
or
a
regulus
of
Af-fold
secants
.
Moreover
,
if
Af
,
no
two
of
the
multiple
secants
can
intersect
.
For
if
such
were
the
case
,
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet
**zg
in
more
than
K
points
or
,
alternatively
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined
by
the
two
lines
would
be
too
high
.
But
if
no
two
lines
of
the
regulus
of
multiple
secants
of
**zg
can
intersect
,
then
the
regulus
must
be
quadratic
,
or
in
other
words
,
**zg
must
be
either
a
Af
or
a
Af
curve
on
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
.
We
now
observe
that
the
case
in
which
**zg
is
a
Af
curve
on
a
quadric
is
impossible
if
the
complex
of
singular
lines
consists
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
Aj
.
For
any
pencil
in
a
plane
containing
a
Af-fold
secant
of
**zg
has
an
image
regulus
which
meets
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
Af
lines
,
namely
the
images
of
the
lines
of
the
pencil
which
pass
through
the
intersection
of
**zg
and
the
multiple
secant
,
plus
an
additional
component
to
account
for
the
intersections
of
the
images
of
the
general
lines
of
the
pencil
.
However
,
if
there
is
no
additional
complex
of
singular
lines
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
a
pencil
is
precisely
Af
.
This
contradicts
the
preceding
observations
,
and
so
,
under
the
assumption
of
this
paper
,
we
must
reject
the
possibility
that
**zg
is
a
Af
curve
on
a
quadric
surface
.
Continuing
with
the
case
in
which
**zg
is
a
Af
curve
on
a
quadric
Q
,
we
first
observe
that
the
second
regulus
of
Q
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
which
join
the
two
free
intersections
of
**zg
and
the
planes
through
any
one
of
the
multiple
secants
.
For
each
of
these
lines
meets
Q
in
three
points
,
namely
two
points
on
**zg
and
one
point
on
one
of
the
multiple
secants
.
Now
consider
an
arbitrary
line
,
l
,
meeting
Q
in
two
points
,
Af
and
Af
.
If
**ya
is
the
multiple
secant
of
**zg
which
passes
through
Af
and
**yb
is
the
simple
secant
of
**zg
which
passes
through
Af
,
and
if
Af
are
the
points
in
which
**ya
meets
**zg
,
and
if
Af
is
the
image
of
Af
on
the
generator
**yb
,
it
follows
that
the
image
of
the
line
Af
is
Af
.
These
societies
can
expect
to
face
difficult
times
.
As
the
historic
processes
of
modernization
gradually
gain
momentum
,
their
cohesion
will
be
threatened
by
divisive
forces
,
the
gaps
between
rulers
and
subjects
,
town
and
country
,
will
widen
;
;
new
aspirants
for
power
will
emerge
whose
ambitions
far
exceed
their
competence
;
;
old
rulers
may
lose
their
nerve
and
their
sense
of
direction
.
National
leaders
will
have
to
display
the
highest
skills
of
statesmanship
to
guide
their
people
through
times
of
uncertainty
and
confusion
which
destroy
men's
sense
of
identity
.
Feelings
of
a
community
of
interest
will
have
to
be
recreated
--
in
some
of
the
new
nations
,
indeed
,
they
must
be
built
for
the
first
time
--
on
a
new
basis
which
looks
toward
the
future
and
does
not
rely
only
on
shared
memories
of
the
past
.
Nevertheless
,
with
foresight
and
careful
planning
,
some
of
the
more
disruptive
and
dangerous
consequences
of
social
change
which
have
troubled
other
countries
passing
through
this
stage
can
be
escaped
.
The
United
States
can
help
by
communicating
a
genuine
concern
with
the
problems
these
countries
face
and
a
readiness
to
provide
technical
and
other
appropriate
forms
of
assistance
where
possible
.
Our
central
goal
should
be
to
provide
the
greatest
positive
incentive
for
these
societies
to
tackle
boldly
the
tasks
which
they
face
.
At
the
same
time
,
we
should
recognize
that
the
obstacles
to
change
and
the
lack
of
cohesion
and
stability
which
characterize
these
countries
may
make
them
particularly
prone
to
diversions
and
external
adventures
of
all
sorts
.
It
may
seem
to
some
of
them
that
success
can
be
purchased
much
less
dearly
by
fishing
in
the
murky
waters
of
international
politics
than
by
facing
up
to
the
intractable
tasks
at
home
.
We
should
do
what
we
can
to
discourage
this
conclusion
,
both
by
offering
assistance
for
their
domestic
needs
and
by
reacting
firmly
to
irresponsible
actions
on
the
world
scene
.
When
necessary
,
we
should
make
it
clear
that
countries
which
choose
to
derive
marginal
advantages
from
the
cold
war
or
to
exploit
their
potential
for
disrupting
the
security
of
the
world
will
not
only
lose
our
sympathy
but
also
risk
their
own
prospects
for
orderly
development
.
As
a
nation
,
we
feel
an
obligation
to
assist
other
countries
in
their
development
;
;
but
this
obligation
pertains
only
to
countries
which
are
honestly
seeking
to
become
responsible
members
of
a
stable
and
forward-moving
world
community
.
Transitional
societies
When
we
look
at
countries
like
Iran
,
Iraq
,
Pakistan
,
and
Burma
,
where
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
creating
a
minimum
supply
of
modern
men
and
of
social
overhead
capital
,
and
where
institutions
of
centralized
government
exist
,
we
find
a
second
category
of
countries
with
a
different
set
of
problems
and
hence
different
priorities
for
policy
.
The
men
in
power
are
committed
in
principle
to
modernization
,
but
economic
and
social
changes
are
proceeding
only
erratically
.
Isolated
enterprises
have
been
launched
,
but
they
are
not
yet
related
to
each
other
in
a
meaningful
pattern
.
The
society
is
likely
to
be
characterized
by
having
a
fairly
modernized
urban
sector
and
a
relatively
untouched
rural
sector
,
with
very
poor
communications
between
the
two
.
Progress
is
impeded
by
psychological
inhibitions
to
effective
action
among
those
in
power
and
by
a
failure
on
their
part
to
understand
how
local
resources
,
human
and
material
,
can
be
mobilized
to
achieve
the
national
goals
of
modernization
already
symbolically
accepted
.
Most
countries
in
this
second
category
share
the
difficulty
of
having
many
of
the
structures
of
a
modern
political
and
social
system
without
the
modern
standards
of
performance
required
to
make
them
effective
.
In
these
rapidly
changing
societies
there
is
also
too
little
appreciation
of
the
need
for
effort
to
achieve
goals
.
The
colonial
period
has
generally
left
people
believing
that
government
can
,
if
it
wishes
,
provide
all
manner
of
services
for
them
--
and
that
with
independence
free
men
do
not
have
to
work
to
realize
the
benefits
of
modern
life
.
For
example
,
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
times
,
most
transitional
societies
have
announced
economic
development
plans
of
varying
numbers
of
years
;
;
such
is
the
mystique
of
planning
that
people
expect
that
fulfillment
of
the
plan
will
follow
automatically
upon
its
announcement
.
The
civil
services
in
such
societies
are
generally
inadequate
to
deal
competently
with
the
problems
facing
them
;
;
and
their
members
often
equate
a
government
career
with
security
and
status
rather
than
with
sacrifice
,
self-discipline
,
and
competence
.
American
policy
should
press
constantly
the
view
that
until
these
governments
demand
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
their
bureaucracies
there
is
not
the
slightest
hope
that
they
will
either
modernize
of
democratize
their
societies
.
We
should
spread
the
view
that
planning
and
national
development
are
serious
matters
which
call
for
effort
as
well
as
enthusiasm
.
Above
all
,
we
should
seek
to
encourage
the
leaders
of
these
societies
to
accept
the
unpleasant
fact
that
they
are
responsible
for
their
fates
.
Only
within
the
framework
of
a
mature
relationship
characterized
by
honest
appraisals
of
performance
can
we
provide
telling
assistance
.
With
respect
to
those
countries
whose
leaders
prefer
to
live
with
their
illusions
,
we
can
afford
to
wait
,
for
in
time
their
comparative
lack
of
progress
will
become
clear
for
all
to
see
.
Our
technical
assistance
to
these
countries
should
place
special
emphasis
on
inducing
the
central
governments
to
assume
the
role
of
advisor
and
guide
which
at
an
earlier
stage
foreign
experts
assumed
in
dealing
with
the
central
governments
.
We
should
encourage
the
governments
to
develop
their
own
technical
assistance
to
communities
,
state
and
provincial
governments
,
rural
communities
,
and
other
smaller
groups
,
making
certain
that
no
important
segment
of
the
economy
is
neglected
.
Simultaneously
we
should
be
underlining
the
interrelationships
of
technical
progress
in
various
fields
,
showing
how
agricultural
training
can
be
introduced
into
education
,
how
health
affects
labor
productivity
,
how
small
business
can
benefit
the
rural
farm
community
,
and
,
above
all
,
how
progress
in
each
field
relates
to
national
progress
.
Efforts
such
as
the
Community
Development
Program
in
the
Philippines
have
demonstrated
that
transitional
societies
can
work
toward
balanced
national
development
.
To
achieve
this
goal
of
balanced
development
,
communications
between
the
central
government
and
the
local
communities
must
be
such
that
the
needs
and
aspirations
of
the
people
themselves
are
effectively
taken
into
account
.
If
modernization
programs
are
imposed
from
above
,
without
the
understanding
and
cooperation
of
the
people
,
they
will
encounter
grave
difficulties
.
Land
reform
is
likely
to
be
a
pressing
issue
in
many
of
these
countries
.
It
should
be
American
policy
not
only
to
encourage
effective
land
reform
programs
but
also
to
underline
the
relation
of
such
reforms
to
the
economic
growth
and
modernization
of
the
society
.
As
an
isolated
policy
,
land
reform
is
likely
to
be
politically
disruptive
;
;
as
part
of
a
larger
development
effort
,
however
,
it
may
gain
wide
acceptance
.
It
should
also
be
recognized
that
the
problem
of
rural
tenancy
cannot
be
solved
by
administrative
decrees
alone
.
Land
reform
programs
need
to
be
supplemented
with
programs
for
promoting
rural
credits
and
technical
assistance
in
agriculture
.
Lastly
,
governmental
and
private
planners
will
at
this
stage
begin
to
see
large
capital
requirements
looming
ahead
.
By
holding
out
prospects
for
external
capital
assistance
,
the
United
States
can
provide
strong
incentives
to
prepare
for
the
concerted
economic
drive
necessary
to
achieve
self-sustaining
growth
.
Actively
modernizing
societies
At
a
third
stage
in
the
modernization
process
are
such
countries
as
India
,
Brazil
,
the
Philippines
,
and
Taiwan
,
which
are
ready
and
committed
to
move
into
the
stage
of
self-sustaining
growth
.
They
must
continue
to
satisfy
basic
capital
needs
;
;
and
there
persists
the
dual
problem
of
maintaining
operational
unity
around
a
national
program
of
modernization
while
simultaneously
decentralizing
participation
in
the
program
to
wider
and
wider
groups
.
But
these
countries
have
made
big
strides
toward
developing
the
necessary
human
and
social
overhead
capital
;
;
they
have
established
reasonably
stable
and
effective
governmental
institutions
at
national
and
local
levels
;
;
and
they
have
begun
to
develop
a
capacity
to
deal
realistically
and
simultaneously
with
all
the
major
sectors
of
their
economies
.
On
the
economic
front
,
the
first
priority
of
these
countries
is
to
mobilize
a
vastly
increased
volume
of
resources
.
Several
related
tasks
must
be
carried
out
if
self-sustaining
growth
is
to
be
achieved
.
These
countries
must
formulate
a
comprehensive
,
long-term
program
covering
the
objectives
of
both
the
private
and
the
public
sectors
of
the
economy
.
They
must
in
their
planning
be
able
to
count
on
at
least
tentative
commitments
of
foreign
capital
assistance
over
periods
of
several
years
.
Capital
imports
drawn
from
a
number
of
sources
must
be
employed
and
combined
skillfully
enough
to
permit
domestic
investment
programming
to
go
forward
.
Capital
flows
must
be
coordinated
with
national
needs
and
planning
.
Finally
,
a
balance
must
be
effected
among
project
finance
,
utilization
of
agricultural
surpluses
,
and
general
balance
of
payments
support
.
Thus
,
although
the
agenda
of
external
assistance
in
the
economic
sphere
are
cumulative
,
and
many
of
the
policies
suggested
for
nations
in
the
earlier
stages
remain
relevant
,
the
basic
purpose
of
American
economic
policy
during
the
later
stages
of
development
should
be
to
assure
that
movement
into
a
stage
of
self-sustaining
growth
is
not
prevented
by
lack
of
foreign
exchange
.
There
remain
many
political
and
administrative
problems
to
be
solved
.
For
one
thing
,
although
considerable
numbers
of
men
have
been
trained
,
bureaucracies
are
still
deficient
in
many
respects
;
;
even
the
famed
Indian
Civil
Service
is
not
fully
adequate
to
the
tremendous
range
of
tasks
it
has
undertaken
.
Technical
assistance
in
training
middle-
and
upper-level
management
personnel
is
still
needed
in
many
cases
.
There
are
also
more
basic
problems
.
This
is
the
stage
at
which
democratic
developments
must
take
place
if
the
society
is
to
become
an
open
community
of
creative
people
.
Nevertheless
,
impulses
still
exist
among
the
ruling
elite
to
rationalize
and
thus
to
perpetuate
the
need
for
centralized
and
authoritarian
practices
.
Another
great
danger
is
that
the
emerging
middle
class
will
feel
itself
increasingly
alienated
from
the
political
leaders
who
still
justify
their
dominance
by
reference
to
the
struggle
for
independence
or
the
early
phase
of
nationalism
.
The
capacity
of
intellectuals
and
members
of
the
new
professional
classes
to
contribute
creatively
to
national
development
is
likely
to
be
destroyed
by
a
constraining
sense
of
inferiority
toward
both
their
own
political
class
and
their
colleagues
and
professional
counterparts
in
the
West
.
Particularly
when
based
upon
a
single
dominant
party
,
governments
may
respond
to
such
a
situation
by
claiming
a
monopoly
of
understanding
about
the
national
interest
.
Convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
their
own
actions
,
and
reassured
by
the
promises
of
their
economic
development
programs
,
governments
may
fail
to
push
outward
to
win
more
and
more
people
to
the
national
effort
,
becoming
instead
more
rigid
and
inflexible
in
their
policies
.
American
policy
toward
such
societies
should
stress
our
sympathy
for
the
emerging
social
and
professional
classes
.
It
should
attempt
to
communicate
both
an
appreciation
of
professional
standards
and
an
understanding
of
the
tremendous
powers
and
potentialities
of
genuinely
open
and
pluralistic
societies
.
We
have
every
obligation
to
take
seriously
their
claims
to
being
democratic
and
free
countries
;
;
we
also
have
,
in
consequence
,
the
duty
to
appraise
realistically
and
honestly
their
performance
and
to
communicate
our
judgments
to
their
leaders
in
frank
but
friendly
ways
.
The
time
factor
We
have
emphasized
that
the
modernizing
process
in
each
society
will
take
a
considerable
period
of
time
.
With
the
exception
of
treaty-making
,
foreign
relations
were
historically
concerned
for
the
most
part
with
conditions
of
short
or
at
least
measurable
duration
.
Foreign
policy
now
takes
on
a
different
perspective
and
must
become
skilled
not
merely
at
response
but
also
at
projection
.
American
and
free-world
policies
can
marginally
affect
the
pace
of
transition
;
;
but
basically
that
pace
depends
on
changes
in
the
supply
of
resources
and
in
the
human
attitudes
,
political
institutions
,
and
social
structure
which
each
society
must
generate
.
It
follows
that
any
effective
policy
toward
the
underdeveloped
countries
must
have
a
realistically
long
working
horizon
.
It
must
be
marked
by
a
patience
and
persistence
which
have
not
always
been
its
trademark
.
This
condition
affects
not
only
the
conception
but
also
the
legislative
and
financial
support
of
foreign
policy
,
especially
in
the
context
of
economic
aid
.

Some
of
the
major
functions
of
religion
The
place
of
religion
in
the
simple
,
preliterate
societies
is
quite
definite
;
;
as
a
complex
it
fits
into
the
whole
social
organization
and
functions
dominantly
in
every
part
of
it
.
In
societies
like
ours
,
however
,
its
place
is
less
clear
and
more
complex
.
With
the
diversity
of
religious
viewpoints
,
there
are
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
essential
features
of
religion
;
;
and
there
are
different
opinions
as
to
the
essential
functions
of
religion
.
Nevertheless
,
for
most
of
the
population
of
heterogeneous
advanced
societies
,
though
less
for
the
less
religious
portion
,
religion
does
perform
certain
modal
individual
and
social
functions
.
Although
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
not
of
direct
significance
in
social
organization
,
they
have
important
indirect
consequences
.
If
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
performed
,
the
individual
is
a
composed
,
ordered
,
motivated
,
and
emotionally
secure
associate
;
;
he
is
not
greatly
frustrated
,
and
he
is
not
anomic
;
;
he
is
better
fitted
to
perform
his
social
life
among
his
fellows
.
There
are
several
closely
related
inner
functions
.
In
the
last
analysis
,
religion
is
the
means
of
inducing
,
formulating
,
expressing
,
enhancing
,
implementing
,
and
perpetuating
man's
deepest
experience
--
the
religious
.
Man
is
first
religious
;
;
the
instrumentalities
follow
.
Religion
seeks
to
satisfy
human
needs
of
great
pertinence
.
The
significant
things
in
it
,
at
the
higher
religious
levels
,
are
the
inner
emotional
,
mental
,
and
spiritual
occurrences
that
fill
the
pressing
human
needs
of
self-preservation
,
self-pacification
,
and
self-completion
.
The
chief
experience
is
the
sensing
of
communion
,
and
in
the
higher
religions
,
of
a
harmonious
relationship
with
the
supernatural
power
.
Related
to
this
is
the
fact
that
most
of
the
higher
religions
define
for
the
individual
his
place
in
the
universe
and
give
him
a
feeling
that
he
is
relatively
secure
in
an
ordered
,
dependable
universe
.
Man
has
the
experience
of
being
helpfully
allied
with
what
he
cannot
fully
understand
;
;
he
is
a
coordinate
part
of
all
of
the
mysterious
energy
and
being
and
movement
.
The
universe
is
a
safe
and
permanent
home
.
A
number
of
religions
also
satisfy
for
many
the
need
of
being
linked
with
the
ultimate
and
eternal
.
Death
is
not
permanent
defeat
and
disappearance
;
;
man
has
a
second
chance
.
He
is
not
lost
in
the
abyss
of
endless
time
;
;
he
has
endless
being
.
Religion
at
its
best
also
offers
the
experience
of
spiritual
fulfillment
by
inviting
man
into
the
highest
realm
of
the
spirit
.
Religion
can
summate
,
epitomize
,
relate
,
and
conserve
all
the
highest
ideals
and
values
--
ethical
,
aesthetic
,
and
religious
--
of
man
formed
in
his
culture
.
There
is
also
the
possibility
,
among
higher
religions
,
of
experiencing
consistent
meaning
in
life
and
enjoying
guidance
and
expansiveness
.
The
kind
of
religious
experience
that
most
moderns
seek
not
only
provides
,
clarifies
,
and
relates
human
yearnings
,
values
,
ideals
,
and
purposes
;
;
it
also
provides
facilities
and
incitements
for
the
development
of
personality
,
sociality
,
and
creativeness
.
Under
the
religious
impulse
,
whether
theistic
or
humanistic
,
men
have
joy
in
living
;
;
life
leads
somewhere
.
Religion
at
its
best
is
out
in
front
,
ever
beckoning
and
leading
on
,
and
,
as
Lippman
put
it
,
``
mobilizing
all
man's
scattered
energies
in
one
triumphant
sense
of
his
own
infinite
importance
''
.
At
the
same
time
that
religion
binds
the
individual
helpfully
to
the
supernatural
and
gives
him
cosmic
peace
and
a
sense
of
supreme
fulfillment
,
it
also
has
great
therapeutic
value
for
him
.
It
gives
him
aid
,
comfort
,
even
solace
,
in
meeting
mundane
life
situations
where
his
own
unassisted
practical
knowledge
and
skill
are
felt
by
him
to
be
inadequate
.
He
is
confronted
with
the
recurrent
crises
,
such
as
great
natural
catastrophes
and
the
great
transitions
of
life
--
marriage
,
incurable
disease
,
widowhood
,
old
age
,
the
certainty
of
death
.
He
has
to
cope
with
frustration
and
other
emotional
disturbance
and
anomie
.
His
religious
beliefs
provide
him
with
plausible
explanations
for
many
conditions
which
cause
him
great
concern
,
and
his
religious
faith
makes
possible
fortitude
,
equanimity
,
and
consolation
,
enabling
him
to
endure
colossal
misfortune
,
fear
,
frustration
,
uncertainty
,
suffering
,
evil
,
and
danger
.
Religion
usually
also
includes
a
principle
of
compensation
,
mainly
in
a
promised
perfect
future
state
.
The
belief
in
immortality
,
where
held
,
functions
as
a
redress
for
the
ills
and
disappointments
of
the
here
and
now
.
The
tensions
accompanying
a
repressive
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
or
sinning
or
some
tormenting
secret
are
relieved
for
the
less
self-contained
or
self-sufficient
by
confession
,
repentance
,
and
penance
.
The
feeling
of
individual
inferiority
,
defeat
,
or
humilation
growing
out
of
various
social
situations
or
individual
deficiencies
or
failures
is
compensated
for
by
communion
in
worship
or
prayer
with
a
friendly
,
but
all-victorious
Father-God
,
as
well
as
by
sympathetic
fellowship
with
others
who
share
this
faith
,
and
by
opportunities
in
religious
acts
for
giving
vent
to
emotions
and
energies
.
In
providing
for
these
inner
individual
functions
,
religion
undertakes
in
behalf
of
individual
peace
of
mind
and
well-being
services
for
which
there
is
no
other
institution
.
In
addition
to
the
functions
of
religion
within
man
,
there
have
always
been
the
outer
social
functions
for
the
community
and
society
.
The
two
have
never
been
separable
.
Religion
is
vitally
necessary
in
both
societal
maintenance
and
regulation
.
The
value-system
of
a
community
or
society
is
always
correlated
with
,
and
to
a
degree
dependent
upon
,
a
more
or
less
shared
system
of
religious
beliefs
and
convictions
.
The
religion
supports
,
re-enforces
,
reaffirms
,
and
maintains
the
fundamental
values
.
Even
in
the
United
States
,
with
its
freedom
of
religious
belief
and
worship
and
its
vast
denominational
differentiation
,
there
is
a
general
consensus
regarding
the
basic
Christian
values
.
This
is
demonstrated
especially
when
there
is
awareness
of
radically
different
value
orientation
elsewhere
;
;
for
example
Americans
rally
to
Christian
values
vis-a-vis
those
of
atheistic
communism
.
In
America
also
all
of
our
major
religious
bodies
officially
sanction
a
universalistic
ethic
which
is
reflective
of
our
common
religion
.
Even
the
non-church
members
--
the
freewheelers
,
marginal
religionists
and
so
on
--
have
the
values
of
Christian
civilization
internalized
in
them
.
Furthermore
,
religion
tends
to
integrate
the
whole
range
of
values
from
the
highest
or
ultimate
values
of
God
to
the
intermediary
and
subordinate
values
;
;
for
example
,
those
regarding
material
objects
and
pragmatic
ends
.
Finally
,
it
gives
sanctity
,
more
than
human
legitimacy
,
and
even
,
through
super-empirical
reference
,
transcendent
and
supernatural
importance
to
some
values
;
;
for
example
,
marriage
as
a
sacrament
,
much
law-breaking
as
sinful
,
occasionally
the
state
as
a
divine
instrument
.
It
places
certain
values
at
least
beyond
questioning
and
tampering
.
Closely
related
to
this
function
is
the
fact
that
the
religious
system
provides
a
body
of
ultimate
ends
for
the
society
,
which
are
compatible
with
the
supreme
eternal
ends
.
This
something
leads
to
a
conception
of
an
over-all
Social
Plan
with
a
meaning
interpretable
in
terms
of
ultimate
ends
;
;
for
example
,
a
plan
that
fulfills
the
will
of
God
,
which
advances
the
Kingdom
of
God
,
which
involves
social
life
as
part
of
the
Grand
Design
.
This
explains
some
group
ends
and
provides
a
justification
of
their
primacy
.
It
gives
social
guidance
and
direction
and
makes
for
programs
of
social
action
.
Finally
,
it
gives
meaning
to
much
social
endeavor
,
and
logic
,
consistency
,
and
meaning
to
life
.
In
general
,
there
is
no
society
so
secularized
as
to
be
completely
without
religiously
inspired
transcendental
ends
.
Religion
integrates
and
unifies
.
Some
of
the
oldest
,
most
persistent
,
and
most
cohesive
forms
of
social
groupings
have
grown
out
of
religion
.
These
groups
have
varied
widely
from
mere
families
,
primitive
,
totemic
groups
,
and
small
modern
cults
and
sects
,
to
the
memberships
of
great
denominations
,
and
great
,
widely
dispersed
world
religions
.
Religion
fosters
group
life
in
various
ways
.
The
common
ultimate
values
,
ends
and
goals
fostered
by
religion
are
a
most
important
factor
.
Without
a
system
of
values
there
can
be
no
society
.
Where
such
a
value
system
prevails
,
it
always
unifies
all
who
possess
it
;
;
it
enables
members
of
the
society
to
operate
as
a
system
.
The
beliefs
of
a
religion
also
reflecting
the
values
are
expressed
in
creeds
,
dogmas
,
and
doctrines
,
and
form
what
Durkheim
calls
a
credo
.
As
he
points
out
,
a
religious
group
cannot
exist
without
a
collective
credo
,
and
the
more
extensive
the
credo
,
the
more
unified
and
strong
is
the
group
.
The
credo
unifies
and
socializes
men
by
attaching
them
completely
to
an
identical
body
of
doctrine
;
;
the
more
extensive
and
firm
the
body
of
doctrine
,
the
firmer
the
group
.
The
religious
symbolism
,
and
especially
the
closely
related
rites
and
worship
forms
,
constitute
a
powerful
bond
for
the
members
of
the
particular
faith
.
The
religion
,
in
fact
,
is
an
expression
of
the
unity
of
the
group
,
small
or
large
.
The
common
codes
,
for
religious
action
as
such
and
in
their
ethical
aspects
for
everyday
moral
behavior
,
bind
the
devotees
together
.
These
are
ways
of
jointly
participating
in
significantly
symbolized
,
standardized
,
and
ordered
religiously
sanctified
behavior
.
The
codes
are
mechanism
for
training
in
,
and
directing
and
enforcing
,
uniform
social
interaction
,
and
for
continually
and
publicly
reasserting
the
solidarity
of
the
group
.
Durkheim
noted
long
ago
that
religion
as
``
a
unified
system
of
beliefs
and
practices
relative
to
sacred
things
unites
into
one
single
moral
community
all
those
who
adhere
to
them
''
.
His
view
is
that
every
religion
pertains
to
a
community
,
and
,
conversely
,
every
community
is
in
one
aspect
a
religious
unit
.
This
is
brought
out
in
the
common
religious
ethos
that
prevails
even
in
the
denominationally
diverse
audiences
at
many
secular
semi-public
and
public
occasions
in
the
United
States
;
;
and
it
is
evidenced
in
the
prayers
offered
,
in
the
frequent
religious
allusions
,
and
in
the
confirmation
of
points
on
religious
grounds
.
The
unifying
effect
of
religion
is
also
brought
out
in
the
fact
that
historically
peoples
have
clung
together
as
more
or
less
cohesive
cultural
units
,
with
religion
as
the
dominant
bond
,
even
though
spatially
dispersed
and
not
politically
organized
.
The
Jews
for
2500
years
have
been
a
prime
example
,
though
the
adherents
of
any
world
or
interpeople
religion
are
cases
in
point
.
It
might
be
pointed
out
that
the
integrating
function
of
religion
,
for
good
or
ill
,
has
often
supported
or
been
identified
with
other
groupings
--
political
,
nationality
,
language
,
class
,
racial
,
sociability
,
even
economic
.
Religion
usually
exercises
a
stabilizing-conserving
function
.
As
such
it
acts
as
an
anchor
for
the
people
.
There
is
a
marked
tendency
for
religions
,
once
firmly
established
,
to
resist
change
,
not
only
in
their
own
doctrines
and
policies
and
practices
,
but
also
in
secular
affairs
having
religious
relevance
.
It
has
thus
been
a
significant
factor
in
the
conservation
of
social
values
,
though
also
in
some
measure
,
an
obstacle
to
the
creation
or
diffusion
of
new
ones
.
It
tends
to
support
the
longstanding
precious
sentiments
,
the
traditional
ways
of
thinking
,
and
the
customary
ways
of
living
.
As
Yinger
has
pointed
out
,
the
``
reliance
on
symbols
,
on
tradition
,
on
sacred
writings
,
on
the
cultivation
of
emotional
feelings
of
identity
and
harmony
with
sacred
values
,
turns
one
to
the
past
far
more
than
to
the
future
''
.
Historically
,
religion
has
also
functioned
as
a
tremendous
engine
of
vindication
,
enforcement
,
sanction
,
and
perpetuation
of
various
other
institutions
.
At
the
same
time
that
religion
exercises
a
conserving
influence
,
it
also
energizes
and
motivates
both
individuals
and
groups
.
Much
of
the
important
individual
and
social
action
has
been
owing
to
religious
incentives
.
The
great
ultimate
ends
of
religion
have
served
as
magnificent
beacon
lights
that
lured
people
toward
them
with
an
almost
irresistible
force
,
mobilizing
energies
and
inducing
sacrifices
;
;
for
example
,
the
Crusades
,
mission
efforts
,
just
wars
.
Much
effort
has
been
expended
in
the
sincere
effort
to
apply
the
teaching
and
admonitions
of
religion
.
The
insuperable
reward
systems
that
most
religions
embody
have
great
motivating
effects
.
Religion
provides
the
most
attractive
rewards
,
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
,
for
those
who
not
merely
abide
by
its
norms
,
but
who
engage
in
good
works
.
Religion
usually
acts
as
a
powerful
aid
in
social
control
,
enforcing
what
men
should
or
should
not
do
.
Among
primitive
peoples
the
sanctions
and
dictates
of
religion
were
more
binding
than
any
of
the
other
controls
exercised
by
the
group
;
;
and
in
modern
societies
such
influence
is
still
great
.
Religion
has
its
own
supernatural
prescriptions
that
are
at
the
same
time
codes
of
behavior
for
the
here
and
now
.
Overwhelmed
with
the
care
of
five
young
children
and
concerned
about
persistent
economic
difficulties
due
to
her
husband's
marginal
income
,
her
defense
of
denial
was
excessively
strong
.
Thus
the
lack
of
effective
recognition
of
the
responsibilities
involved
in
caring
for
two
babies
showed
signs
of
becoming
a
disabling
problem
.
The
result
,
dramatically
visible
in
a
matter
of
days
in
the
family's
disrupted
daily
functioning
,
was
a
phobic-like
fear
that
some
terrible
harm
would
befall
the
second
twin
,
whose
birth
had
not
been
anticipated
.
Soon
Mrs.
B.'s
fears
threatened
to
burst
into
a
full-blown
panic
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
entire
family
.
Inability
to
care
for
the
other
children
,
difficulty
in
feeding
the
babies
,
who
seemed
colicky
,
bone-weary
fatigue
,
repeated
crying
episodes
,
and
short
tempers
reflected
the
family's
helplessness
in
coping
with
the
stressful
situation
.
Clearly
,
this
was
a
family
in
crisis
.
Mrs.
B.
compared
her
feelings
of
weakness
to
her
feelings
of
weakness
and
helplessness
at
the
time
of
her
mother's
death
when
she
was
eight
,
as
well
as
her
subsequent
anger
at
her
father
for
remarrying
.
Her
previous
traumatic
experiences
flashed
through
her
mind
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
father's
death
she
poured
out
with
agonized
tears
her
feelings
of
guilt
about
not
having
attended
his
funeral
.
In
the
family's
own
words
(
during
the
third
of
twelve
visits
)
,
they
had
``
reached
the
crisis
peak
--
either
the
situation
will
give
or
we
will
break
''
!
!
Direct
confrontation
and
acceptance
of
Mrs.
B.'s
anger
against
the
second
baby
soon
dissipated
her
fears
of
annihilation
.
Abreaction
of
her
anxiety
and
guilt
concerning
the
death
of
her
parents
,
when
linked
up
with
her
current
feelings
of
anger
and
her
fears
of
loss
,
abandonment
,
and
annihilation
,
produced
further
relief
of
tension
.
In
a
joint
interview
Mr.
and
Mrs.
B.
were
helped
to
understand
the
meaning
of
a
younger
son's
wandering
away
from
home
in
terms
of
his
feelings
of
displacement
in
reaction
to
the
arrival
of
the
twins
.
The
father
,
accurately
perceiving
the
child's
needs
,
not
only
respected
them
as
worthy
of
his
attention
,
but
immediately
satisfied
them
by
taking
him
on
his
lap
along
with
the
twins
,
saying
,
``
I
have
a
big
lap
;
;
there
is
room
for
you
,
too
,
Johnnie
''
.
Simultaneously
,
a
variety
of
environmental
supports
--
a
calm
but
not
too
motherly
homemaker
,
referral
for
temporary
economic
aid
,
intelligent
use
of
nursing
care
,
accompaniment
to
the
well-baby
clinic
for
medical
advice
on
the
twins'
feeding
problem
--
combined
to
prevent
further
development
of
predictable
pathological
mechanisms
.
Follow-up
visits
of
the
nurse
and
social
worker
indicated
continued
success
in
the
care
of
the
new
babies
as
well
as
a
marked
improvement
in
the
family's
day-to-day
mental
health
and
social
functioning
.
As
seen
in
the
B.
family
,
there
must
be
an
attempt
to
help
the
client
develop
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
.
The
lack
of
awareness
usually
springs
from
deep
but
disguised
anxiety
,
often
assuming
the
superficial
guise
of
``
not
knowing
''
or
``
not
caring
''
.
The
unhealthy
use
of
denial
in
the
initial
reaction
to
a
stress
must
be
handled
through
the
medium
of
a
positive
controlled
transference
.
In
general
,
the
approach
is
more
active
than
passive
,
more
out-reaching
than
reflective
.
While
some
regression
is
inevitable
,
it
is
discouraged
rather
than
encouraged
so
that
the
transference
does
not
follow
the
stages
of
planned
regression
associated
with
certain
casework
adaptations
of
the
psychoanalytic
model
for
insight
therapy
.
To
establish
an
emotionally
meaningful
relationship
the
worker
must
demonstrate
actual
or
potential
helpfulness
immediately
,
preferably
within
the
first
interview
,
by
meeting
the
client's
specific
needs
.
These
needs
usually
concern
the
reduction
of
guilt
and
some
relief
of
tension
.
The
initial
interview
must
be
therapeutic
rather
than
purely
exploratory
in
an
information-seeking
sense
.
In
this
relationship-building
stage
the
worker
must
communicate
confidence
in
the
client's
ability
to
deal
with
the
problem
.
In
so
doing
he
implicitly
offers
the
positive
contagion
of
hope
as
a
kind
of
maturational
dynamic
to
counteract
feelings
of
helplessness
and
hopelessness
generally
associated
with
the
first
stages
of
stress
impact
.
Thus
,
the
client
receives
enough
ego
support
to
engage
in
constructive
efforts
on
his
own
behalf
.
Here
there
is
a
specific
preventive
component
which
applies
in
a
more
generalized
sense
to
any
casework
situation
.
We
are
preventing
or
averting
pathogenic
phenomena
such
as
undue
regression
,
unhealthy
suppression
and
repression
,
excessive
use
of
denial
,
and
crippling
guilt
turned
against
the
self
.
While
some
suppression
and
some
denial
are
not
only
necessary
but
healthy
,
the
worker's
clinical
knowledge
must
determine
how
these
defenses
are
being
used
,
what
healthy
shifts
in
defensive
adaptation
are
indicated
,
and
when
efforts
at
bringing
about
change
can
be
most
effectively
timed
.
In
steering
the
family
toward
ego-adaptive
and
away
from
maladaptive
responses
,
the
worker
uses
time-honored
focused
casework
techniques
of
specific
emotional
support
,
clarification
,
and
anticipatory
guidance
.
Over
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
,
usually
about
four
to
twelve
weeks
,
the
worker
must
be
able
to
shift
the
focus
,
back
and
forth
,
between
immediate
external
stressful
exigencies
(
``
precipitating
stress
''
)
and
the
key
,
emotionally
relevant
issues
(
``
underlying
problem
''
)
which
are
,
often
in
a
dramatic
preconscious
breakthrough
,
reactivated
by
the
crisis
situation
,
and
hence
once
again
amenable
to
resolution
.
Though
there
is
obviously
nothing
new
about
these
techniques
,
they
do
challenge
the
worker's
skill
to
articulate
them
precisely
on
the
spot
and
on
the
basis
of
quick
and
accurate
diagnostic
assessments
.
Then
,
too
,
the
utmost
clinical
flexibility
is
necessary
in
judiciously
combining
carefully
timed
family-oriented
home
visits
,
single
and
group
office
interviews
,
and
appropriate
telephone
follow-up
calls
,
if
the
worker
is
to
be
genuinely
accessible
and
if
the
predicted
unhealthy
outcome
is
to
be
actually
averted
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
preventive
intervention
.
In
addition
,
in
many
cases
,
a
variety
of
concrete
social
resources
--
homemaker
,
day
care
,
medical
and
financial
aid
--
must
be
reasonably
available
for
the
reality
support
needed
to
bolster
the
family
in
its
individual
and
collective
coping
and
integrative
efforts
.
At
certain
critical
stages
,
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
,
it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem-solving
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather
than
defeating
.
While
expensive
in
time
and
involving
a
great
deal
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
worker
(
in
terms
of
his
willingness
to
leave
the
sanctity
of
his
office
and
enter
actively
into
the
client's
life
)
,
techniques
of
accompaniment
were
found
to
be
of
tremendous
value
when
in
the
service
of
specific
preventive
objectives
.
Finally
,
whatever
the
techniques
used
,
a
twin
goal
is
common
to
all
preventive
casework
service
:
to
cushion
or
reduce
the
force
of
the
stress
impact
while
at
the
same
time
to
encourage
and
support
family
members
to
mobilize
and
use
their
ego
capacities
.
Having
outlined
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
,
we
now
address
ourselves
to
our
final
question
:
What
place
should
brief
,
crisis-oriented
preventive
casework
occupy
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
?
?
We
should
first
recognize
our
tendency
to
develop
a
hierarchy
of
values
,
locating
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
long-term
intensive
service
at
the
top
,
instead
of
seeing
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
,
each
important
in
its
own
right
.
This
problem
is
perhaps
as
old
as
social
casework
itself
.
Almost
three
decades
ago
Bertha
Reynolds
undertook
a
study
of
short-contact
interviewing
because
of
her
conviction
that
short-term
casework
had
an
important
but
neglected
place
in
our
network
of
social
services
.
Her
conclusion
has
been
borne
out
in
the
experience
of
many
practitioners
:
``
short-contact
interviewing
is
neither
a
truncated
nor
a
telescoped
experience
but
is
of
the
same
essential
quality
as
the
so-called
intensive
case
work
''
.
Thus
,
casework
involving
a
limited
number
of
interviews
is
still
to
be
regarded
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
service
rendered
rather
than
of
the
quantity
of
time
expended
.
That
we
are
experiencing
an
upsurge
of
interest
in
the
many
formulations
and
preventive
adaptations
of
brief
treatment
in
social
casework
is
evident
from
even
a
small
sampling
of
current
literature
.
Especially
noteworthy
is
Levinger's
finding
that
the
length
of
treatment
per
se
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
successful
outcome
.
According
to
a
number
of
studies
,
the
important
predictors
are
the
nature
and
management
of
the
client's
anxiety
as
well
as
the
accessibility
of
the
helping
person
.
For
example
,
the
level
of
improvement
noted
in
a
recent
experiment
with
a
short
course
of
immediate
treatment
for
parent-child
relationship
problems
compared
favorably
with
the
results
reported
by
typical
child
guidance
clinics
where
the
hours
spent
in
purely
diagnostic
study
may
equal
or
exceed
the
number
of
hours
devoted
to
actual
treatment
interviews
in
the
experimental
project
.
Of
startling
significance
,
too
,
is
the
assertion
that
it
was
possible
to
carry
out
this
program
with
only
a
6
percent
attrition
rate
as
compared
with
a
rate
of
59
percent
reported
for
a
comparable
group
of
families
who
were
receiving
help
in
traditionally
operated
child
guidance
services
.
These
reports
refer
to
a
level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
.
Similarities
to
the
approach
which
I
have
described
are
evident
in
the
prompt
establishment
of
a
helping
relationship
,
quick
appraisal
of
key
issues
,
and
the
immediate
mobilization
of
treatment
plans
as
the
essential
dynamics
in
helping
to
further
the
ego's
coping
efforts
in
dealing
with
the
interplay
of
inner
and
outer
stresses
.
While
there
are
many
different
possibilities
for
the
timing
of
casework
intervention
,
the
experiments
recently
reported
from
a
variety
of
traditional
settings
all
point
up
the
importance
of
an
immediate
response
to
the
client's
initial
need
for
help
.
In
some
programs
,
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period
of
time
,
while
in
others
,
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
,
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
.
Willingness
to
take
the
risk
of
early
and
direct
interpretation
(
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
interpretation
is
too
threatening
,
the
worker
can
withdraw
)
is
another
prominent
feature
in
these
efforts
.
My
aim
in
mentioning
this
factor
obviously
is
not
to
give
license
to
``
wild
therapy
''
but
rather
to
encourage
us
to
use
the
time-honored
clinical
casework
skills
we
already
possess
,
and
to
use
them
with
greater
confidence
,
precision
,
and
professional
pride
.
Though
there
is
obviously
great
need
for
continued
experimentation
with
various
types
of
short-term
intervention
to
further
efforts
in
developing
an
operational
definition
of
prevention
at
the
secondary
--
or
perhaps
,
in
some
instances
,
primary
--
level
,
the
place
of
short-term
intervention
has
already
been
documented
by
a
number
of
investigators
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
.
Woodward
,
for
example
,
has
emphasized
the
``
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
,
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
''
.
Ideally
,
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived
at
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather
than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
.
Moreover
,
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental
health
manpower
force
us
to
innovate
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make
services
more
widely
available
--
and
on
a
more
effective
basis
to
more
people
.
Further
research
in
the
meaning
of
crises
as
experienced
by
the
consumers
of
traditional
social
casework
services
--
including
attempts
to
develop
a
typology
of
family
structures
,
crisis
problems
,
reaction
mechanisms
,
and
differential
treatment
approaches
--
and
the
establishment
of
new
experimental
programs
are
imperative
social
needs
which
should
command
the
best
efforts
of
caseworkers
in
collaboration
with
community
planners
.
Our
literature
is
already
replete
with
a
fantastic
number
of
suggestions
for
preventive
agency
programming
ranging
from
the
immediately
practical
to
the
globally
utopian
.
Probably
,
in
the
immediate
future
,
we
will
have
to
settle
for
middle-range
efforts
that
fall
short
of
utopian
models
.
Increased
experimentation
with
multipurpose
agencies
,
especially
those
that
combine
afresh
the
traditional
functions
of
family
and
child
welfare
services
,
holds
rich
promise
for
the
future
.
For
example
,
child
welfare
experience
abounds
with
cases
in
which
the
parental
request
for
substitute
care
is
precipitated
by
a
crisis
event
which
is
meaningfully
linked
with
a
fundamental
unresolved
problem
of
family
relationships
.
Sentiment
.
Tension
management
and
communication
of
sentiment
are
the
processes
involved
in
the
functioning
of
the
element
of
sentiment
or
feeling
.
One
of
the
devices
for
tension
management
is
preferential
mating
.
The
preferential
mating
of
this
particular
population
has
been
analyzed
in
a
separate
study
.
The
relative
geographical
isolation
of
the
Brandywine
population
makes
for
a
limited
choice
in
mating
.
It
would
seem
necessary
that
members
of
this
population
provide
support
for
one
another
since
it
is
not
provided
by
the
larger
society
.
The
supportive
relations
can
apparently
be
achieved
in
geographical
and
social
isolation
.
The
newlyweds
building
homes
on
the
same
land
with
either
set
of
parents
,
and
the
almost
exclusive
use
of
members
of
the
population
as
sponsors
for
baptisms
and
weddings
illustrate
this
supportive
relationship
.
As
Loomis
remarks
,
``
In
the
internal
pattern
the
chief
reason
for
interacting
is
to
communicate
liking
,
friendship
,
and
love
among
those
who
stand
in
supporting
relations
to
one
another
and
corresponding
negative
sentiments
to
those
who
stand
in
antagonistic
relations
''
.
Achieving
.
Maintenance
of
the
status
quo
might
seem
to
be
the
appropriate
goal
or
objective
of
this
population
today
.
Yet
,
the
object
of
the
element
of
achieving
through
the
process
of
goal
attaining
for
this
population
appears
to
have
been
changed
by
circumstances
brought
about
by
the
war
.
Prior
to
World
War
2
,
there
was
a
higher
percentage
of
endogamous
marriages
than
after
World
War
2
.
Norms
.
The
norms
,
as
elements
,
refer
to
``
all
criteria
for
judging
the
character
or
conduct
of
both
individual
and
group
actions
in
any
social
system
''
.
The
process
of
evaluation
assigns
varying
positive
and
negative
priorities
or
values
to
elements
.
The
elements
and
processes
become
evident
in
a
study
of
mate
selection
in
this
population
.
From
the
evidence
``
it
may
be
conjectured
that
core
-
core
marriages
are
the
preferred
unions
for
core
males
and
females
;
;
core
-
marginal
marriages
still
belong
in
the
category
of
permissive
unions
;
;
and
core
-
Negro
marriages
are
proscribed
for
core
members
''
.
Status-roles
.
The
element
of
status-roles
and
associated
processes
have
not
been
sufficiently
investigated
for
this
population
to
permit
any
type
of
conjectures
about
them
.
Power
.
There
is
some
indication
from
a
limited
number
of
interviews
with
members
of
the
population
that
the
element
of
power
,
primarily
the
voluntary
influence
of
non-authoritative
power
,
has
been
exerted
on
actors
in
the
system
,
particularly
in
regard
to
mate
selection
.
This
would
seem
to
vary
from
family
to
family
,
depending
somewhat
on
the
core
or
marginal
``
status
''
of
that
family
.
Again
,
size
of
the
group
may
have
some
influence
on
the
strength
of
group
controls
.
Ranking
.
Interviews
with
members
of
the
Brandywine
population
were
attempted
in
order
to
discover
the
ranking
of
the
various
families
in
the
population
.
The
large
majority
of
the
interviewees
placed
core
families
in
the
upper
positions
.
Loomis
considers
ranking
a
product
of
the
evaluation
process
.
``
The
standing
or
rank
of
an
actor
in
a
given
social
system
is
determined
by
the
evaluation
placed
upon
the
actor
and
his
acts
in
accordance
with
the
norms
and
standards
of
the
system
''
.
Despite
the
increasing
rate
of
exogamous
marriages
,
the
population
has
been
able
to
sustain
,
at
least
to
some
degree
,
the
consciousness
of
its
intermediate
status
in
society
.
To
some
extent
the
system
can
be
considered
a
Gemeinschaft
in
which
``
social-role
occupancies
are
determined
by
birth
,
by
attributes
such
as
sex
or
caste
,
which
are
biologically
or
socially
immutable
''
.
The
adherence
of
many
in
the
population
to
the
Indian
background
in
their
pedigree
,
and
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
their
ancestors
had
never
been
slaves
,
becomes
of
prime
interest
in
determining
how
far
these
elements
promote
the
self-image
of
the
intermediate
status
of
the
group
in
society
.
Sanctions
.
The
negative
sanctions
applied
to
core
-
Negro
marriages
for
core
members
act
as
indicators
of
expected
adherence
to
group
norms
.
However
,
because
of
Church
laws
,
lately
more
stringently
enforced
,
which
forbid
the
marriage
of
cousins
closely
related
consanguineously
,
a
means
of
facilitating
the
goal
of
in-group
relations
may
be
that
of
recourse
to
illegitimate
unions
.
A
cursory
survey
of
available
material
indicates
a
high
rate
of
illegitimate
births
occurring
to
parents
who
have
a
close
consanguineous
relationship
.
Subsystems
The
comprehensive
or
master
processes
activate
all
or
some
of
the
elements
within
the
social
system
and
subsystems
.
Within
the
larger
social
system
are
the
structural
and
functional
subsystems
.
The
structural
subsystem
,
consisting
of
relatively
stable
inter-relationships
among
its
parts
,
includes
:
1
.
Subgroups
of
various
types
,
interconnected
by
relational
norms
.
2
.
Roles
of
various
types
,
within
the
larger
system
and
within
the
subgroups
3
.
Regulative
norms
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.
4
.
Cultural
values
.
In
the
study
of
marriage
patterns
for
this
group
,
consanguinity
produces
the
structural
system
--
a
system
of
affinities
--
which
,
in
turn
,
maintains
the
system
of
consanguinity
.
Subgroups
of
various
types
have
been
found
within
this
system
.
Each
family
line
can
be
considered
a
substructure
.
There
seems
to
be
an
implied
cultural
value
attached
to
the
fact
of
core
status
within
the
group
.
Additionally
,
the
proscription
of
core
-
Negro
marriages
for
core
families
,
discussed
above
,
would
seem
to
act
as
a
regulative
norm
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.
The
scope
of
this
study
does
not
provide
for
the
study
of
roles
of
various
types
within
the
larger
system
or
within
the
subgroups
.
However
,
it
cannot
be
presumed
,
informal
though
the
structure
of
the
population
seems
,
that
there
are
not
well-defined
roles
within
the
system
.
The
present
study
relates
to
the
theory
of
functional
systems
.
It
is
hypothesized
that
fertility
is
a
function
of
the
social
system
when
the
population
as
a
whole
is
considered
and
a
function
of
the
subsystems
when
the
two-fold
division
of
core
families
and
marginal
families
is
considered
.
The
four
functional
problems
of
a
social
system
are
,
to
some
extent
,
solved
by
the
subsystems
within
this
population
.
By
means
of
geographical
isolation
and
high
fertility
rates
,
inbreeding
can
be
fostered
and
the
pattern
of
isolation
from
the
greater
society
maintained
.
In
order
to
attain
the
goal
of
group
solidarity
and
to
relieve
tension
,
the
high
fertility
rate
provides
more
group
members
for
mate
selection
,
and
the
clustering
of
members
in
groups
fosters
acceptance
of
group
controls
.
To
maintain
their
intermediate
position
in
the
larger
society
,
it
is
not
only
necessary
that
members
of
this
population
be
``
visible
''
,
but
that
their
numbers
be
great
enough
to
be
recognized
as
a
separate
,
distinct
grouping
or
system
in
society
.
As
mentioned
above
,
where
families
are
concentrated
in
larger
numbers
,
group
controls
seem
strongest
and
most
effective
.
Adaptation
to
the
social
and
non-social
environment
through
the
economy
has
been
met
to
a
degree
through
a
type
of
occupational
segregation
.
This
provides
the
necessary
contact
with
the
larger
society
,
while
supporting
a
type
of
control
over
members
in
terms
of
social
contacts
.
Integration
``
has
to
do
with
the
inter-relation
of
parts
''
.
The
problem
of
solidarity
and
morale
again
involves
the
concept
of
values
.
The
values
placed
by
the
Brandywine
population
,
upon
maintaining
a
certain
homogeneity
,
a
certain
separate
racial
identity
,
and
therefore
a
certain
separate
social
status
,
are
important
for
the
morale
of
the
system
.
Since
morale
is
closely
related
to
pattern
maintenance
and
integration
,
the
higher
the
morale
and
solidarity
,
the
better
the
system
can
solve
the
problems
of
the
system
.
In
this
respect
it
would
seem
that
the
greater
the
social
distance
between
the
Brandywine
population
and
the
white
and
Negro
populations
within
the
same
general
locality
,
the
greater
the
possibility
for
higher
morale
and
solidarity
within
the
Brandywine
population
.
It
is
conceived
that
one
of
the
means
to
attain
this
social
distance
is
that
of
physical
and
social
isolation
.
In
turn
,
higher
fertility
rates
for
this
population
provide
a
means
of
increasing
the
numerical
quantity
of
the
population
,
allowing
for
the
possibility
of
greater
stability
and
unity
.
The
population
can
thereby
replenish
itself
and
actually
grow
larger
.
Master
processes
Of
particular
utility
in
the
analysis
of
the
development
,
persistence
,
and
change
of
social
systems
has
been
the
use
of
the
master
or
comprehensive
processes
.
Loomis
considers
six
such
processes
in
his
paradigm
.
1
.
Communication
2
.
Boundary
maintenance
3
.
Systemic
linkage
4
.
Socialization
5
.
Social
control
6
.
Institutionalization
Though
undoubtedly
all
six
processes
are
operative
within
the
whole
social
system
and
its
subsystems
,
two
processes
that
are
of
crucial
importance
to
this
study
will
be
singled
out
for
particular
emphasis
.
Communication
.
In
discussing
the
process
of
communication
,
Loomis
defines
it
as
``
the
process
by
which
information
,
decisions
,
and
directives
are
transmitted
among
actors
and
the
ways
in
which
knowledge
,
opinions
,
and
attitudes
are
formed
,
or
modified
by
interaction
''
.
Communication
may
be
facilitated
by
means
of
the
high
visibility
within
the
larger
community
.
Intense
interaction
is
easier
where
segregated
living
and
occupational
segregation
mark
off
a
group
from
the
rest
of
the
community
,
as
in
the
case
of
this
population
.
However
,
the
factor
of
physical
isolation
is
not
a
static
situation
.
Although
the
Brandywine
population
is
still
predominantly
rural
,
``
there
are
indications
of
a
consistent
and
a
statistically
significant
trend
away
from
the
older
and
relatively
isolated
rural
communities
.
Urbanization
appears
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of
this
group
.
This
conclusion
is
,
however
,
an
over-simplification
.
A
more
realistic
analysis
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
Brandywine
people
in
the
urban-fringe
area
are
,
in
general
,
less
segregated
locally
than
group
members
in
rural
areas
.
In
the
urban
area
,
in
other
words
,
they
,
unlike
some
urban
ethnic
groups
,
do
not
concentrate
in
ghetto
colonies
.
Group
pressures
toward
conformity
are
slight
or
non-existent
,
and
deviant
behavior
in
mate
selection
incurs
few
if
any
social
sanctions
.
In
such
a
setting
social
contacts
and
associations
are
likely
to
be
heterogamous
,
resulting
in
a
change
of
values
and
,
almost
necessarily
,
in
mate
selection
behavior
.
To
the
extent
that
urban
life
contributes
to
the
breakdown
of
the
group
patterns
of
residential
isolation
,
to
that
extent
it
contributes
directly
to
increased
exogamy
''
.
Social
control
.
The
process
of
social
control
is
operative
insofar
as
sanctions
play
a
part
in
the
individual's
behavior
,
as
well
as
the
group's
behavior
.
By
means
of
this
social
control
,
deviance
is
either
eliminated
or
somehow
made
compatible
with
the
function
of
the
social
group
.
Examples
from
this
population
indicate
that
deviance
seems
to
be
sanctioned
by
ostracism
from
the
group
.
Socialization
.
There
is
an
oral
tradition
among
the
members
of
the
population
in
regard
to
the
origin
and
subsequent
separate
status
of
the
group
in
the
larger
society
.
Confused
and
divided
though
this
tradition
may
be
,
it
is
an
important
part
of
the
social
and
cultural
heritage
of
the
group
,
and
acts
as
a
means
of
socialization
,
particularly
for
members
of
the
rural
community
.
The
fact
of
Indian
ancestry
and
``
free
''
status
during
the
days
of
slavery
,
are
important
distinctions
made
by
members
of
the
group
.
Boundary
maintenance
.
``
Culturally
induced
social
cohesion
resulting
from
common
norms
and
values
internalized
by
members
of
the
group
''
is
operative
in
the
boundary
maintenance
of
the
group
as
well
as
in
the
process
of
socialization
.
The
process
of
boundary
maintenance
identifies
and
preserves
the
social
system
or
subsystems
,
and
the
characteristic
interaction
is
maintained
.
As
the
threat
of
encroachment
on
the
system
increases
,
the
``
probability
of
applied
boundary
maintenance
mechanisms
increases
''
.
The
fertility
rate
pattern
would
seem
to
be
a
function
,
though
a
latent
one
,
of
the
process
of
maintaining
the
boundary
.
``
Increased
boundary
maintenance
may
be
achieved
,
for
example
,
by
assigning
a
higher
primacy
or
evaluation
to
activities
characteristic
of
the
external
pattern
.
''
The
external
pattern
or
external
system
can
be
considered
as
``
group
behavior
that
enables
the
group
to
survive
in
its
environment
.
''
Boundary
maintenance
for
this
group
would
seem
to
be
primarily
social
,
as
is
the
preference
for
endogamy
.
It
is
also
expressed
in
the
proscription
against
deviants
in
the
matter
of
endogamy
,
particularly
in
rural
areas
.
By
their
pattern
of
endogamy
and
exogamy
,
the
core
families
and
the
marginal
families
show
distinct
limits
to
the
intergroup
contact
they
maintain
.
Systemic
linkage
.
Where
boundary
maintenance
describes
the
boundaries
or
limits
of
the
group
,
systemic
linkage
is
defined
``
as
the
process
whereby
one
or
more
of
the
elements
of
at
least
two
social
systems
is
articulated
in
such
a
manner
that
the
two
systems
in
some
ways
and
on
some
occasions
may
be
viewed
as
a
single
unit
.
A
royal
decree
issued
in
1910
,
two
years
after
the
Belgian
government
assumed
authority
for
the
administration
of
the
Congo
,
prescribed
the
registration
of
all
adult
males
by
chiefdoms
.
Further
decrees
along
this
line
were
issued
in
1916
and
1919
.
In
1922
a
continuous
registration
of
the
whole
indigenous
population
was
instituted
by
ordinance
of
the
Governor-General
,
and
the
periodic
compilation
of
these
records
was
ordered
.
But
specific
procedures
for
carrying
out
this
plan
were
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
provincial
governors
.
A
unified
set
of
regulations
,
applicable
to
all
areas
,
was
issued
in
1929
,
and
a
complementary
series
of
demographic
inquiries
in
selected
areas
was
instituted
at
the
same
time
.
The
whole
system
was
again
reviewed
and
reorganized
in
1933
.
General
responsibility
for
its
administration
rested
with
a
division
of
the
colonial
government
concerned
with
labor
supply
and
native
affairs
,
Service
des
Affaires
Indigenes
et
de
la
Main-d'Oeuvre
(
AIMO
,
Af
Direction
,
Af
Direction
Generale
,
Gouvernement
Generale
)
.
Tribal
authorities
,
the
chiefs
and
their
secretaries
,
were
held
responsible
for
maintaining
the
registers
of
indigenous
persons
within
their
territories
,
under
the
general
supervision
of
district
officials
.
The
district
officials
,
along
with
their
other
duties
,
were
obliged
to
organize
special
demographic
inquiries
in
selected
areas
and
to
supervise
the
annual
tabulations
of
demographic
statistics
.
The
regulations
require
the
inscription
of
each
individual
(
male
or
female
,
adult
or
child
)
on
a
separate
card
(
fiche
)
.
The
cards
,
filed
by
circonscription
(
sub-chiefdom
,
or
village
)
,
are
kept
in
the
headquarters
of
each
territoire
(
chiefdom
)
.
Each
card
is
expected
to
show
certain
information
about
the
individual
concerned
,
including
his
or
her
date
of
birth
(
or
age
at
a
specified
time
)
,
spouses
,
and
children
.
Additional
entries
must
be
made
from
time
to
time
.
Different
cards
are
used
for
males
and
females
,
and
a
corner
is
clipped
from
the
cards
of
adults
,
and
of
children
when
they
reach
puberty
.
So
a
quick
count
could
be
made
at
any
time
,
even
by
an
illiterate
clerk
,
of
the
number
of
registered
persons
in
four
age-and-sex
classes
.
Personal
identification
cards
are
issued
to
all
adult
males
on
which
tax
payments
,
inoculations
,
periods
of
employment
,
and
changes
of
residence
are
recorded
.
Similar
identification
cards
were
issued
in
1959
to
all
adult
females
.
Each
adult
is
held
personally
responsible
for
assuring
his
inscription
and
obtaining
an
identification
card
which
must
be
shown
on
demand
.
The
registration
card
of
a
person
leaving
his
home
territory
for
a
short
period
is
put
into
a
special
file
for
absent
persons
.
The
cards
of
permanent
out-migrants
are
,
in
theory
,
sent
to
an
office
in
the
place
of
new
residence
.
Finally
,
the
registration
of
births
and
deaths
by
nearest
relatives
was
made
compulsory
in
most
regions
.
Numbers
of
registered
persons
in
four
age-and-sex
classes
were
counted
each
year
.
In
addition
,
demographic
inquiries
,
supposedly
involving
field
investigations
,
were
conducted
in
selected
minor
divisions
(
circonscriptions
)
containing
about
3
percent
of
the
total
population
.
The
results
of
these
inquiries
were
used
to
adjust
compilations
of
data
from
the
registers
and
to
provide
various
ratios
and
rates
by
districts
,
including
birth
and
death
rates
,
general
fertility
rates
,
distributions
by
marital
status
,
fertility
of
wives
separately
in
polygynous
and
non-polygynous
households
,
infant
mortality
,
and
migration
.
The
areas
to
be
examined
in
these
inquiries
were
selected
by
local
officials
,
supposedly
as
representative
of
a
larger
population
.
Averages
of
the
ratios
obtained
in
a
few
selected
areas
were
applied
to
the
larger
population
.
The
scheme
,
in
theory
,
is
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
European
registration
systems
to
the
conditions
of
African
life
.
But
it
places
a
severe
strain
on
the
administrative
resources
(
already
burdened
in
other
ways
)
of
a
widely
dispersed
,
poor
and
largely
illiterate
population
.
The
sampling
program
was
instituted
before
the
principles
of
probability
sampling
were
widely
recognized
in
population
studies
.
The
system
was
not
well
adapted
to
conditions
of
life
in
urban
centers
.
The
distinction
between
domiciled
(
de
jure
)
and
present
(
de
facto
)
population
was
not
clearly
defined
.
So
the
results
are
subject
to
considerable
confusion
.
The
system
tended
to
break
down
during
the
war
,
but
was
reactivated
;
;
it
had
reached
the
pre-war
level
of
efficiency
by
1951
.
In
spite
of
the
defects
in
this
system
,
the
figures
on
total
population
during
the
late
1930's
and
again
in
the
early
1950's
seem
to
have
represented
actual
conditions
in
most
districts
with
approximate
fidelity
.
But
the
information
on
the
dynamics
of
population
was
often
quite
misleading
.
The
same
system
,
with
minor
modifications
,
was
developed
in
Ruanda-Urundi
under
Belgian
administration
.
Here
again
it
seems
that
useful
approximations
of
the
size
and
geographical
distribution
of
the
population
were
obtained
in
this
way
in
the
late
pre-war
and
early
post-war
periods
.
Before
considering
more
recent
activities
,
we
should
note
another
important
aspect
of
demography
in
Belgian
Africa
.
A
number
of
strong
independent
agencies
,
established
in
some
cases
with
governmental
or
royal
support
,
have
conducted
large
medical
,
social
,
educational
and
research
operations
in
particular
parts
of
the
Congo
and
Ruanda-Urundi
.
The
work
of
Fonds
Reine
Elisabeth
pour
l'Assistance
Medicale
aux
Indigenes
Du
Congo
Belge
(
FOREAMI
)
has
special
interest
with
respect
to
demography
.
This
agency
accepted
responsibility
for
medical
services
to
a
population
ranging
from
638,560
persons
in
1941
to
840,503
in
1956
in
the
Kwango
District
and
adjacent
areas
east
of
Leopoldville
.
Each
year
from
1941
on
,
its
medical
staff
had
conducted
intensive
field
investigations
to
determine
changes
in
population
structure
and
vital
rates
and
,
as
its
primary
objective
,
the
incidence
of
major
diseases
.
Its
findings
are
reported
each
year
in
its
Rapport
Sur
l'activite
Pendant
annee
(
Bruxelles
)
.
Somewhat
similar
investigations
have
been
made
by
medical
officers
in
other
areas
.
Other
independent
,
or
partially
independent
agencies
,
have
promoted
investigations
on
topics
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
demography
.
These
studies
vary
widely
in
scope
and
precision
.
L'Institut
pour
La
Recherche
Scientifique
En
Afrique
Centrale
(
IRSAC
)
has
sponsored
well-designed
field
investigations
and
has
cooperated
closely
with
the
government
of
Ruanda-Urundi
in
the
development
of
its
official
statistics
.
A
massive
investigation
of
the
characteristics
of
in-migrants
and
prospective
out-migrants
in
Ruanda-Urundi
is
being
carried
on
by
J.
J.
Maquet
,
former
Director
of
the
Social
Science
branch
of
IRSAC
,
now
a
professor
at
l'Universite
Officielle
Du
Congo
Belge
et
Du
Ruanda-Urundi
.
Some
30,000
completed
schedules
with
20
items
(
collected
by
sub-chiefs
in
1,100
circumscriptions
)
have
been
tabulated
.
The
results
are
now
being
analyzed
.
Statistics
have
been
recognized
as
a
matter
of
strategic
importance
in
the
Congo
and
in
Ruanda-Urundi
during
the
post-war
years
in
connection
with
long-term
economic
and
social
programs
.
The
AIMO
organizations
of
both
countries
,
which
maintain
administrative
services
throughout
the
territories
,
retained
immediate
responsibility
for
the
collection
and
publication
of
demographic
information
.
However
,
the
statistical
offices
of
both
governments
were
assigned
responsibility
for
the
planning
and
analysis
of
these
statistics
.
A
Bureau
De
La
Demographie
(
A.
Romaniuk
,
Director
)
was
formed
under
AIMO
in
the
Congo
,
to
work
in
close
rapport
with
the
Section
Statistique
of
the
Secretariat
General
.
Eventually
responsibility
for
demographic
inquiries
in
the
Congo
was
transferred
to
the
demographic
division
of
the
Central
Statistical
Office
.
The
1952
demographic
inquiry
in
Ruanda-Urundi
was
directed
by
V.
Neesen
,
a
member
of
the
IRSAC
staff
,
though
the
inquiry
was
carried
out
under
the
auspices
of
AIMO
,
which
has
continuing
responsibility
for
demographic
statistics
in
this
territory
.
A
member
of
the
IRSAC
staff
(
E.
Van
De
Walle
)
was
recently
delegated
to
cooperate
with
AIMO
in
the
development
of
demographic
statistics
in
this
territory
.
The
initiation
of
sampling
censuses
in
Ruanda-Urundi
(
1952
)
and
in
the
Congo
(
1955
-
57
)
were
major
advances
.
We
will
deal
first
with
the
program
in
the
Congo
though
this
was
put
into
operation
later
than
the
other
.
The
radical
nature
of
the
innovation
in
the
Congo
was
not
emphasized
in
the
official
announcements
.
The
term
enquetes
demographiques
,
previously
used
for
the
supplementary
investigations
carried
out
in
connection
with
the
administrative
censuses
,
was
used
for
the
new
investigations
.
However
,
the
differences
in
procedure
are
fundamental
.
These
are
as
follows
:
(
1
)
field
work
procedures
.
Field
operations
were
transferred
from
administrative
personnel
primarily
engaged
in
other
tasks
to
specially
trained
teams
of
full-time
African
investigators
(
three
teams
,
each
working
in
two
provinces
)
.
These
teams
carried
out
the
same
operations
successively
in
different
areas
.
(
2
)
nature
of
the
sample
.
Sample
areas
in
the
new
investigations
were
selected
strictly
by
application
of
the
principles
of
probability
theory
,
so
as
to
be
representative
of
the
total
population
of
defined
areas
within
calculable
limits
.
In
short
,
scientific
sampling
was
introduced
in
place
of
subjective
sampling
.
The
populations
of
the
various
districts
,
or
other
major
divisions
,
were
stratified
by
type
of
community
(
rural
,
urban
,
mixed
)
and
,
where
appropriate
,
by
ethnic
affiliation
and
by
type
of
economy
.
Sample
units
(
villages
in
rural
areas
,
houses
in
cities
)
were
drawn
systematically
within
these
strata
.
(
3
)
size
of
the
sample
.
Different
sampling
ratios
were
applied
under
different
conditions
.
Higher
proportions
were
sampled
in
urban
and
mixed
communities
than
in
rural
areas
.
About
11
percent
of
the
total
population
was
covered
in
the
new
investigation
,
as
compared
with
about
3
percent
in
the
previous
inquiries
.
(
4
)
questions
and
definitions
.
Uniform
questions
,
definitions
,
and
procedures
were
enforced
throughout
the
whole
country
.
Data
were
obtained
,
separately
,
on
three
classes
of
persons
:
(
A
)
residents
,
present
;
;
(
B
)
residents
,
absent
;
;
and
(
C
)
visitors
.
In
the
reports
,
summary
results
are
given
for
both
the
de
facto
(
A
and
C
)
and
de
jure
(
A
and
B
)
populations
;
;
but
the
subsequent
analysis
of
characteristics
is
reported
only
for
the
de
jure
population
(
or
,
in
some
districts
,
only
the
de
facto
population
)
.
These
changes
represent
,
in
effect
,
a
shift
from
(
1
)
an
administrative
compilation
of
data
obtained
through
procedures
designed
primarily
to
serve
political
and
economic
objectives
to
(
2
)
a
systematic
sampling
census
of
the
whole
African
population
.
The
population
registration
system
still
has
important
functions
.
It
supplies
local
data
which
are
useful
in
administration
and
which
can
be
used
as
a
basis
for
intensive
studies
in
particular
situations
.
It
provides
a
frame
for
the
sampling
census
.
It
also
provides
a
frame
within
which
the
registration
of
vital
events
is
gradually
gaining
force
(
though
one
cannot
expect
to
obtain
reliable
vital
statistics
in
most
parts
of
the
Congo
from
this
source
in
the
near
future
)
.
It
is
still
used
in
making
current
population
estimates
in
post-census
years
,
though
the
value
of
these
estimates
is
open
to
question
.
Finally
,
it
may
have
certain
very
important
,
less
obvious
values
.
Even
though
the
registers
may
have
an
incomplete
record
of
persons
present
in
a
particular
area
or
include
persons
no
longer
living
there
,
they
contain
precise
information
on
ages
,
by
date
of
birth
,
for
some
of
the
persons
present
(
especially
children
in
relatively
stable
communities
)
and
supplementary
information
(
such
as
records
of
marital
status
)
for
many
others
.
The
quality
of
the
census
data
can
,
therefore
,
be
greatly
improved
by
the
use
of
the
registration
records
in
conjunction
with
the
field
inquiries
.
Furthermore
,
it
may
be
possible
to
estimate
the
error
due
to
bias
in
method
(
as
distinguished
from
sampling
error
)
in
each
of
these
sources
,
on
such
subjects
as
fertility
,
mortality
,
and
migration
during
a
given
interval
by
using
information
from
two
largely
independent
sources
in
conjunction
.
The
first
sampling
census
in
the
Congo
extended
over
a
three-year
period
,
1955
-
57
;
;
the
results
were
still
being
processed
in
1959
.
It
is
planned
to
double
the
number
of
teams
and
to
make
use
of
improved
equipment
in
a
second
demographic
inquiry
in
1960
,
so
that
the
inquiry
can
be
carried
through
in
one
year
and
the
results
published
more
expeditiously
.
It
is
proposed
that
in
the
future
complete
sampling
censuses
be
carried
out
at
five-year
intervals
.
Reports
already
issued
on
the
sampling
census
,
1955
-
57
,
in
various
areas
run
as
follows
(
using
only
the
French
and
omitting
corresponding
Flemish
titles
)
.
This
report
contains
preliminary
notes
and
35
tables
.
Other
reports
in
identical
form
,
but
with
somewhat
varying
content
,
have
been
issued
.
These
area
reports
will
be
followed
,
according
to
present
plans
,
by
a
summary
report
,
which
will
include
a
detailed
statement
on
methods
.
With
this
evidence
in
mind
,
the
writer
began
to
plan
how
he
might
more
effectively
educate
the
married
students
in
his
functional
classes
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
semester's
work
,
he
interviewed
every
married
class
member
at
great
length
.
He
found
,
as
he
had
suspected
,
a
general
consensus
that
perhaps
over
half
of
the
present
functionally
designed
course
was
not
really
functional
for
these
students
.
However
,
all
admitted
that
the
``
hindsight
''
was
not
altogether
lost
.
In
their
own
words
,
it
had
aided
them
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
how
they
had
gotten
into
their
marriages
,
and
perhaps
they
had
obtained
some
insights
on
why
certain
troubles
appeared
from
time
to
time
.
In
fact
,
they
went
so
far
as
to
caution
the
writer
that
if
he
attempted
to
design
a
section
exclusively
for
married
students
there
should
be
,
at
the
beginning
,
some
``
hindsight
''
study
;
;
but
they
all
hastened
to
add
that
certainly
less
time
was
needed
on
it
than
presently
spent
.
All
of
them
felt
a
compelling
need
for
more
coverage
on
areas
that
could
be
only
lightly
touched
upon
in
a
general
survey
functional
course
.
A
few
were
doubtful
about
the
merits
of
an
exclusive
section
for
married
students
.
As
one
of
them
expressed
it
,
``
It
has
done
me
a
world
of
good
to
listen
to
the
naive
questions
and
comments
of
these
not-yet-married
people
.
I
can
now
better
see
just
what
processes
provoked
certain
actions
from
me
in
the
past
.
Had
I
been
in
an
all-married
section
I
would
have
missed
this
,
and
I
believe
that
this
single
aspect
has
been
of
great
personal
value
to
me
''
.
This
comment
and
others
similar
to
it
,
would
seem
to
indicate
a
possible
justification
for
continuing
the
status
quo
.
But
the
weight
of
feeling
was
heavily
in
the
opposite
direction
.
Thus
,
the
writer
decided
to
hold
one
experimental
section
of
the
functional
preparation
for
marriage
course
in
the
spring
semester
of
1960
exclusively
for
persons
already
married
--
that
is
,
prerequisite
:
``
marriage
''
.
This
did
not
mean
that
married
students
could
not
enroll
in
other
``
mixed
''
sections
,
and
some
of
them
,
largely
because
of
scheduling
difficulties
,
did
.
But
only
those
already
married
could
enroll
in
this
one
section
.
In
addition
,
two
other
differences
in
the
two
types
of
sections
must
be
noted
.
(

)
The
regular
sections
do
not
allow
freshmen
;
;
this
one
did
.
This
action
was
rationalized
on
the
basis
of
a
small
survey
which
indicated
that
a
high
percentage
of
married
freshmen
women
on
our
campus
never
become
sophomores
.
Many
of
them
appear
to
drop
out
,
for
one
reason
or
another
.
By
permitting
freshman
students
we
might
extend
the
opportunity
for
such
a
course
to
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
never
get
to
take
it
.
This
has
subsequently
been
verified
by
the
experience
.
(

)
Auditors
were
encouraged
.
In
the
regular
sections
they
have
always
been
more
or
less
discouraged
.
The
philosophy
has
been
that
if
they
could
find
the
time
to
attend
class
why
not
encourage
them
to
get
the
credit
and
perhaps
provide
an
incentive
to
do
the
work
more
effectively
.
Besides
,
auditors
do
not
count
on
faculty
load
with
the
same
weight
as
regularly
enrolled
students
.
But
in
this
one
section
we
welcomed
auditors
.
Why
?
?
For
no
particular
reason
,
other
than
that
the
writer
felt
it
might
--
just
might
--
encourage
both
mates
to
be
in
attendance
.
Many
of
the
men
on
our
campus
have
a
pretty
set
curriculum
,
especially
in
the
various
engineering
fields
,
with
few
electives
till
the
senior
year
.
Incidentally
,
it
needs
to
be
noted
that
because
auditors
were
permitted
the
section
began
increasing
in
numbers
each
week
,
until
at
last
it
swelled
to
such
proportions
that
this
``
free
''
auditing
policy
had
to
be
retracted
.
