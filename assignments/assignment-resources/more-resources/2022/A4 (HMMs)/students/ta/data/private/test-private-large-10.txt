Somewhere
in
the
city
a
big
clock
sounded
twelve
solemn
notes
--
midnight
.
According
to
the
medical
examiner
she
was
shot
between
eleven
p.m.
and
one
a.m.
.
Alec
heard
a
faint
sound
.
His
heart
seemed
to
swell
and
knock
against
the
wall
of
his
chest
.
For
the
sound
was
inside
the
room
.
He
let
his
eyelids
droop
and
breathed
heavily
,
feigning
sleep
.
The
sound
was
coming
nearer
.
A
monstrous
shadow
fell
across
the
illuminated
wall
,
distorted
and
indefinable
.
When
the
neon
sign
faded
out
,
the
shadow
disappeared
.
When
the
neon
sign
flashed
on
,
the
shadow
was
still
there
.
It
stretched
to
an
impossible
height
,
climbing
the
wall
to
the
ceiling
.
That
meant
that
something
between
the
light
and
its
reflection
on
the
wall
was
moving
closer
to
the
source
of
the
light
--
in
this
case
,
the
window
.
Cautiously
Alec
tensed
his
muscles
,
ready
to
jump
.
The
bedsprings
betrayed
him
with
a
creak
.
The
shadow
vanished
.
Someone
had
moved
beyond
the
range
of
the
light
from
the
window
.
Abandoning
caution
,
Alec
leaped
out
of
bed
and
groped
for
the
light
switch
.
Before
he
could
snap
it
on
,
a
stinging
blow
caught
him
in
the
ribs
.
He
lashed
out
blindly
with
his
right
.
There
was
a
thick
,
squashy
crack
of
fist
on
flesh
.
Something
hard
grazed
his
knuckles
.
He
put
everything
he
had
into
the
next
and
aimed
down
where
the
stomach
ought
to
be
.
Rough
cloth
rasped
his
fist
.
There
was
a
grunt
,
curiously
inarticulate
,
like
that
of
an
animal
in
pain
.
Something
heavy
shook
the
floor
as
it
dropped
.
Alec
waited
a
moment
,
on
guard
.
Nothing
happened
.
Again
he
groped
for
the
light
switch
.
The
blue
rug
had
been
rolled
up
and
stacked
in
one
corner
of
the
room
.
On
the
bare
floorboards
a
man
lay
face
down
.
He
had
a
short
,
heavy
,
powerful
body
.
Alec
turned
him
over
and
discovered
a
round
,
lumpy
face
with
narrow
,
slanting
eyes
--
a
primitive
Tartar
face
from
Russia
or
the
Balkans
.
The
man's
shoes
were
too
pointed
,
his
overcoat
too
broad
at
the
shoulders
and
too
narrow
at
the
waist
.
There
was
a
slight
bulge
under
the
left
armpit
--
a
shoulder
holster
.
Alec
promptly
removed
the
gun
.
He
was
familiar
with
this
type
.
He
had
seen
it
in
the
lineup
at
Police
Headquarters
in
New
York
,
in
Broadway
night
clubs
and
Seventh
Avenue
pool
rooms
,
in
the
criminal
courts
.
But
he
was
surprised
to
meet
it
here
.
Diana
Beauclerk
had
no
connection
with
the
underworld
.
A
professional
gunman
would
not
have
killed
her
with
a
weapon
of
such
small
caliber
as
a
.
Nor
would
he
choose
a
respectable
hotel
as
the
scene
for
a
killing
when
it
would
be
so
much
safer
to
take
his
victim
for
a
one-way
ride
on
a
lonely
country
road
.
The
man's
eyelids
fluttered
.
He
opened
his
eyes
.
``
What
are
you
doing
here
''
?
?
Demanded
Alec
.
The
man
made
no
reply
.
His
eyes
were
dazed
.
His
lips
were
bruised
and
swollen
where
Alec
had
hit
him
.
``
Did
you
kill
Diana
Beauclerk
''
?
?
Alec
expected
an
indignant
denial
,
but
there
was
no
response
at
all
.
``
Oh
,
come
on
,
snap
out
of
it
!
!
Or
I'll
turn
you
over
to
the
police
''
!
!
The
silence
was
getting
on
Alec's
nerves
.
The
man
opened
his
mouth
,
but
no
words
came
.
Only
that
curious
,
animal
grunting
Alec
had
heard
during
their
fight
.
``
Don't
you
speak
English
''
?
?
The
man
opened
his
mouth
wider
.
A
forefinger
pointed
toward
his
gullet
.
Alec
leaned
forward
to
look
.
There
were
hideous
scars
inside
the
throat
and
the
palate
was
mutilated
.
In
good
time
I
shall
get
to
the
distressing
actuality
,
to
Red
McIver
and
Handley
Walker
,
to
murder
and
sudden
death
.
But
you
realize
,
I
am
sure
,
how
much
old
deeds
incite
to
new
ones
,
and
you
must
forgive
me
if
I
tell
you
first
of
the
old
ones
.
It
was
in
1814
that
Abraham
Wharf
and
his
sister
sat
by
a
meager
fire
in
their
house
on
Dogtown
Common
,
a
desolate
place
even
then
.
He
was
sharpening
his
razor
.
``
Sister
''
,
said
he
``
do
you
think
people
who
commit
suicide
go
to
heaven
''
?
?
And
she
answered
,
``
I
don't
know
,
but
I
hope
you'll
never
do
such
a
thing
''
.
Without
a
tremor
,
``
God
forbid
''
!
!
He
said
,
and
went
out
and
cut
his
throat
in
the
cave
near
Granny
Day's
swamp
.
What
has
this
to
do
with
the
present
?
?
Much
,
I
assure
you
.
You
must
know
what
gets
into
people
,
even
such
as
Red
and
Handley
,
before
you
can
tell
what
comes
out
of
them
.
They
had
learned
,
both
of
them
,
about
Abraham
Wharf
.
That's
why
I
beg
you
not
to
forget
him
.
His
ghost
is
not
laid
.
Red
and
Handley
,
God
help
them
,
knew
the
old
Dogtown
lore
;
;
and
I
knew
they
knew
it
,
for
I'd
told
them
a
lot
of
it
.
And
isn't
it
true
that
you
get
a
deeper
perception
about
a
man
and
his
motives
when
you
know
what
it
is
he
knows
?
?
Yes
,
gentlemen
,
I
am
getting
to
the
point
,
to
my
point
.
You
know
the
facts
;
;
they
are
set
forth
in
your
own
newspapers
.
You
want
from
me
the
story
,
but
a
story
is
about
'
why
'
and
then
,
perhaps
,
about
how
.
The
'
when
'
you
know
;
;
yesterday
morning
.
So
what
I
am
trying
to
tell
you
is
the
'
why
'
--
that
is
my
point
--
and
that
concerns
the
spirit
of
the
matter
.
There
is
an
inwardness
and
a
luster
to
old
furniture
(
look
at
that
mahogany
highboy
behind
you
)
which
has
a
provocative
emanation
,
if
I
may
say
so
.
Places
,
too
,
have
their
haunting
qualities
.
Even
people
.
And
my
point
in
this
sad
story
is
the
spirit
of
the
matter
.
When
you
hold
the
spirit
of
a
thing
,
then
somehow
you
know
the
truth
--
you
know
a
fake
antique
from
the
real
thing
.
And
the
truth
is
what
you've
come
for
,
is
it
not
?
?
Now
,
Dogtown
is
one
of
those
places
that
creeps
into
the
marrow
as
worms
get
into
old
wood
,
under
the
veneer
.
In
fact
,
all
the
folk
who
lived
on
the
back
of
Cape
Ann
,
they
are
not
just
like
others
.
There's
a
different
hall-mark
on
them
.
There
were
no
witch
burnings
here
because
everyone
had
a
witch
in
the
family
.
Just
think
of
old
Granther
Stannard
who
pulled
the
teeth
of
Dark
Younger
(
her
real
name
was
Dorcas
)
,
and
because
he
bungled
the
job
and
left
two
protruding
tusks
she
put
such
a
hex
on
him
that
he
thought
his
legs
were
made
of
glass
.
After
that
he
was
never
known
to
run
or
even
walk
fast
.
Today
Dogtown
is
the
only
deserted
village
in
all
New
England
that
I
know
of
.
There
it
sits
,
a
small
highland
,
with
towns
like
Gloucester
near
by
;
;
but
now
it's
the
most
lost
and
tortured
place
in
the
world
.
Those
who
lived
in
that
desolation
of
rocky
deformity
took
on
some
of
the
moraine's
stony
character
.
Scientists
say
it
is
the
last
spewings
of
a
great
glacier
,
but
one
rather
feels
that
only
a
malevolent
giant
could
have
piled
up
those
crouching
monsters
of
granite
which
still
seem
to
preserve
a
sort
of
suspended
,
ominous
life
in
them
.
We'll
walk
up
there
later
.
It's
perhaps
a
mile
from
here
where
we
sit
.
And
not
one
single
dwelling
left
there
,
though
once
,
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
,
there
were
close
to
a
hundred
houses
.
(
I
myself
have
identified
about
sixty
sites
,
from
the
old
maps
and
registers
.
A
fascinating
pursuit
,
I
assure
you
.
)
Even
I
can
remember
nothing
but
ruined
cellars
and
tumbled
pillars
,
and
nobody
has
lived
there
in
the
memory
of
any
living
man
.
It
is
now
a
sweep
of
boulders
and
ledges
,
with
oak
,
walnut
and
sumac
creeping
across
the
common
,
and
everywhere
the
ruins
and
the
long
,
long
shadows
.
That's
your
setting
,
and
a
sinister
one
.
Please
get
that
in
your
reports
.
It
accounts
for
so
many
things
.
Both
Red
McIver
and
Handley
Walker
lived
nearby
,
almost
as
near
as
I
do
.
Red
lived
at
Lanesville
,
and
from
his
house
he
could
be
up
on
the
Common
in
a
half
hour's
brisk
walk
;
;
Handley
lived
further
on
,
at
Pigeon
Cove
.
I'd
often
find
one
or
other
of
them
up
around
Dogtown
sketching
.
They
were
both
painters
,
(
They
were
?
?
They
are
?
?
What
should
one
say
?
?
)
Well
,
anyhow
,
Dogtown
Common
is
so
much
off
the
beaten
track
nowadays
that
only
Sunday
picnickers
still
stray
up
there
,
from
time
to
time
.
Sea-road
,
railroad
,
lack
of
water
,
killed
Dogtown
.
Dead
,
dead
as
a
brass
door
nail
,
and
I
sometimes
feel
like
the
Sexton
,
for
I'm
about
the
last
to
be
even
interested
.
I
knew
Red
and
Handley
well
.
As
I
said
,
they
were
both
painters
.
They'd
come
,
separately
,
to
Gloucester
some
twenty
years
ago
--
there's
always
been
an
artists'
colony
somewhere
on
Cape
Ann
--
and
each
married
here
.
They
married
cousins
,
Anta
and
Freya
Norberg
.
There
are
a
lot
of
Scandinavians
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
,
and
many
still
make
painted
furniture
and
take
steam-baths
.
Pretty
girls
among
them
,
with
blonde
hair
and
pert
faces
.
Handley
married
Freya
and
Red
,
of
the
red
beard
,
married
Anta
.
And
it
was
because
of
an
old
Norberg
inheritance
that
I
got
to
understand
them
all
so
well
.
The
quarrel
ended
in
a
ridiculous
draw
,
but
I
must
tell
you
about
it
.
Oh
,
yes
,
I'm
quite
sure
it's
important
,
because
of
the
Beech
Pasture
.
What's
that
?
?
Why
,
that's
what
gave
me
the
feeling
,
gave
me
as-it-were
the
spirit
,
the
demoniac
,
evil
spirit
of
this
whole
affair
.
You
see
,
besides
being
custodian
of
antiquities
,
I
am
also
registrar
.
No
,
I
don't
hold
with
those
who
live
entirely
among
dead
things
.
I
know
as
well
as
the
next
man
that
a
ship
is
called
from
the
rigging
she
carries
,
where
the
live
wind
blows
,
and
not
from
the
hull
.
But
you've
got
to
know
both
.
What's
below
the
water-line
interests
me
also
.
As
I
was
saying
,
I've
known
all
about
the
old
records
,
including
the
old
Norberg
deed
.
Some
ten
years
ago
that
page
was
torn
out
,
I
don't
know
by
whom
.
About
five
years
ago
,
Handley
came
to
ask
me
if
he
could
see
the
tattered
register
.
He
was
courteous
and
casual
about
it
,
as
though
it
were
of
no
consequence
.
He's
always
like
that
,
in
spite
of
being
a
big
man
.
(
When
you
see
him
,
you'll
notice
his
habit
of
fingering
,
I
might
almost
say
,
stroking
a
large
mole
with
black
hairs
on
it
,
by
his
right
temple
.
)
A
sensual
man
,
but
very
courteous
,
some
would
say
slick
.
Like
his
glossy
black
hair
.
Too
many
outside
manners
,
to
my
taste
.
He
is
the
sort
who
,
with
an
appraising
eye
,
would
cross
the
street
to
help
a
strange
woman
on
to
a
bus
and
then
pinch
her
.
A
real
gentleman
,
I
feel
,
would
do
neither
.
He's
always
worn
a
broad-brimmed
hat
,
and
I've
noticed
,
in
my
small
study
at
the
Society
,
that
he
rather
smells
of
cosmetics
.
The
next
week
,
cousin
Red
wandered
in
as
casually
,
but
curt
and
untidy
.
Red
was
small
and
fine-boned
,
like
ivory-inlay
.
He
too
asked
to
see
the
same
page
.
When
I
told
him
someone
had
torn
it
out
,
he
shouted
.
``
By
God
,
it's
that
damn
Handley
,
the
sneak
''
!
!
And
later
in
the
same
week
they
both
came
together
to
examine
the
register
.
Fortunately
we
were
alone
in
the
building
--
so
few
people
nowadays
are
interested
even
in
their
own
past
or
in
the
lovely
craft
of
other
days
--
for
they
began
to
abuse
each
other
in
the
foulest
language
.
Red
thrusting
out
his
tawny
beard
,
Handley
glowering
under
his
suddenly
rumpled
black
hair
.
They
actually
bristled
.
Le
rouge
et
le
noir
.
Violent
men
both
.
Red
always
was
morose
,
yet
that
day
the
dapper
Handley
was
the
louder
of
the
two
.
But
for
my
presence
,
they
would
have
been
at
each
others'
throats
.
During
the
quarrel
I
learned
what
the
trouble
was
,
from
the
accusations
each
hurled
at
the
other
.
The
Beech
Pasture
had
suddenly
become
valuable
.
There's
a
fine
granite
quarry
there
,
and
granite's
coming
back
for
public
buildings
.
Both
men
knew
it
was
in
the
Norberg
family
holdings
,
but
to
which
of
the
cousins
did
it
belong
,
Anta
or
Freya
?
?
Fortunately
,
I
knew
almost
exactly
what
the
will
had
said
.
It
began
with
a
preamble
,
of
course
.
This
explained
that
the
judge
of
probate
of
Essex
County
,
1785
or
1786
,
appointed
three
free-holders
of
Gloucester
to
divide
and
establish
the
Norberg
estate
.
After
the
usual
Honorable
Sirs
,
it
went
on
to
say
that
there
had
been
set
off
to
the
widow
one
full
third
part
of
the
real
estate
of
the
deceased
Salu
Norberg
,
one
lower
room
,
on
the
Western
side
,
privileges
to
the
well
and
bake-oven
and
to
one
third
of
the
cellar
(
I
can
show
you
the
cellar
when
we
go
up
)
,
also
one
Cow
Right
,
and
lastly
they
set
off
to
the
widow
her
own
land
that
she
brought
with
her
as
dower
,
namely
the
Beech
Pasture
.
And
I
remember
that
the
whole
of
the
privileges
,
not
counting
the
Beech
Pasture
,
was
valued
at
twenty
pounds
.
I
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
crests
fall
on
these
two
sparring
coxcombs
when
I
told
them
that
obviously
the
pasture
belonged
to
their
wives
jointly
.
That
battle
scene
,
ridiculous
as
it
was
,
remained
in
my
mind
.
A
disturbing
picture
of
bad
blood
,
to
be
further
heightened
with
illicit
if
buccolic
colors
,
for
on
a
subsequent
day
I
saw
Handley
escorting
Anta
,
Red's
wife
,
up
on
Dogtown
Common
.
I
felt
it
would
be
inopportune
to
disclose
my
presence
.
Not
that
I
intentionally
go
unperceived
,
but
the
boulders
up
there
are
very
high
and
I
am
a
small
woman
.
One
other
cause
of
jealousy
between
them
I
must
tell
you
.
Paint
!
!
Gloomy
and
unkempt
as
Red
McIver
was
,
he
was
much
the
better
painter
.
I
suppose
Handley
knew
it
.
If
Red
had
a
show
at
Gloucester
,
Handley
would
hurry
to
hang
his
pictures
in
Rockport
.
You
may
say
this
has
little
pertinence
,
but
,
gentlemen
,
remember
that
all
this
prepared
my
mind
,
alerted
my
intelligence
.
By
such
touches
the
pattern
takes
shape
.
You
would
call
these
the
motives
of
crime
.
I
would
call
them
the
patterns
of
life
,
perhaps
even
the
designs
of
destiny
.
Yet
with
all
this
knowledge
I
had
nothing
of
substance
to
unravel
our
case
,
as
you
would
call
it
,
till
yesterday
.
One
month
ago
,
on
the
20th
of
October
,
was
the
opening
of
the
gunning
season
in
Massachusetts
.
Not
much
to
shoot
,
but
there
are
a
few
pheasant
.
Rabbits
,
too
,
if
you
care
for
them
,
which
most
of
the
folk
around
here
haven't
the
sense
to
appreciate
.
Any
more
than
they
have
the
sense
to
eat
mussels
.
That
was
the
day
Red
was
said
to
have
gone
away
.
Oh
yes
,
he'd
talked
about
doing
so
.
In
fact
,
he
often
disappeared
,
from
time
to
time
,
--
off
to
paint
the
sea
,
aboard
a
dragger
out
from
Gloucester
.
Anta
,
his
wife
,
never
seemed
to
mind
.
I
suppose
these
absences
gave
her
more
clearance
for
her
embraces
with
Cousin
Handley
.
Anyhow
,
I
wasn't
surprised
,
early
that
morning
,
to
see
Handley
himself
crossing
from
Dogtown
Common
Road
to
the
Back
Road
.
No
,
he
didn't
have
his
gun
,
which
he
should
have
.
It
would
have
been
a
good
excuse
for
his
being
there
at
all
.
I
myself
had
been
up
there
by
seven
o'clock
,
after
mushrooms
,
since
there'd
been
a
week
of
rain
which
had
stopped
early
that
morning
and
the
day
was
as
clear
as
Sandwich
glass
.
That's
what
the
man
had
said
.
Haney
peered
doubtfully
at
his
drinking
companion
through
bleary
,
tear-filled
eyes
.
He
had
no
ready
answer
,
as
much
from
surprise
as
from
the
fit
of
coughing
.
Was
the
man
drunk
or
crazy
or
both
?
?
But
his
new-found
buddy
had
matched
him
drink
for
drink
until
he
lost
count
,
and
the
man's
eyes
were
still
clear
.
The
guy
is
off
his
rocker
,
Haney
thought
to
himself
,
and
looked
away
from
those
eyes
.
Eyes
that
were
clear
,
but
also
bright
with
a
strange
intensity
,
a
sort
of
cold
fire
burning
behind
them
.
Why
hadn't
he
noticed
it
before
?
?
No
,
the
man
was
not
drunk
He
wondered
how
he
got
tied
up
with
this
stranger
.
But
,
of
course
,
he
remembered
now
.
It
was
blurred
,
after
two
hours
of
steady
drinking
,
but
the
occasion
of
it
came
back
to
him
.
The
stranger
,
his
head
seemingly
sunk
in
thought
,
started
to
cross
the
street
against
the
light
just
as
a
huge
moving
van
roared
through
the
intersection
.
Brakes
howled
and
a
horn
blared
furiously
,
but
the
man
would
have
been
hit
if
Phil
hadn't
called
out
to
him
a
second
before
.
His
shout
had
been
involuntary
,
something
anybody
might
have
done
without
thinking
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
wouldn't
have
cared
at
all
if
the
guy
had
been
hit
.
Actually
,
he
regretted
having
opened
his
mouth
when
the
truck
came
to
a
stop
and
the
angry
driver
jumped
down
from
the
cab
and
walked
back
toward
them
.
By
then
,
the
stranger
was
thanking
Haney
profusely
and
had
one
arm
around
his
shoulders
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
.
So
the
driver
started
to
curse
at
both
of
them
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
plot
together
to
ruin
his
safe-driving
record
.
Then
the
man
he
saved
turned
and
looked
squarely
into
the
truck
driver's
face
,
without
saying
a
word
.
Very
suddenly
,
the
driver
stopped
swearing
at
them
,
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
to
his
truck
.
Haney
hadn't
given
it
much
thought
at
the
time
.
Now
he
recalled
it
very
clearly
,
and
wondered
what
the
truck
driver
had
seen
in
those
eyes
to
make
him
back
off
.
It
must
have
been
the
sort
of
look
that
can
call
a
bluff
without
saying
a
word
.
When
the
light
went
their
way
,
they
went
on
across
the
street
.
And
when
the
stranger
found
out
that
Phil
was
on
the
way
to
one
of
his
favorite
bars
,
he
insisted
on
offering
to
buy
drinks
for
both
of
them
.
Phil
usually
went
alone
and
kept
to
himself
,
sitting
in
a
corner
and
passing
the
time
by
nursing
his
favorite
grudges
.
But
he
decided
he
wouldn't
mind
company
in
return
for
free
drinks
,
even
though
he
made
good
money
at
his
job
.
Phil
was
like
that
.
Now
he
wondered
if
it
was
worth
it
,
having
a
screwball
for
company
.
He
really
didn't
take
the
offer
seriously
,
but
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
.
When
he
finally
got
the
coughing
under
control
,
he
realized
that
Pete
(
all
he
gave
was
his
first
name
)
was
still
waiting
for
an
answer
--
he
didn't
even
seem
to
wink
as
he
continued
to
stare
.
Haney
managed
a
weak
laugh
.
``
Guess
I
can't
think
of
anyone
,
Pete
.
Thanks
anyhow
''
.
A
faint
crease
appeared
between
the
man's
eyebrows
.
``
I
think
you
aren't
taking
me
seriously
,
Phil
.
I
meant
it
.
And
everybody
has
some
kind
of
grudge
.
I
might
have
got
hit
by
that
truck
if
it
wasn't
for
you
.
I
believe
in
returning
favors
.
I'll
do
anything
for
somebody
I
like
.
It
won't
cost
you
a
cent
,
Phil
.
Go
ahead
and
try
me
''
!
!
Phil
rubbed
his
forehead
wearily
.
He
was
beginning
to
feel
woolly
.
Maybe
it
would
be
better
to
humor
the
guy
and
then
make
an
exit
.
He
really
didn't
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
,
and
there
were
a
few
people
``
All
right
''
,
he
conceded
finally
,
``
if
you
must
know
,
I
don't
get
along
with
the
landlord
.
He
keeps
riding
me
because
I
like
to
listen
to
the
radio
and
sing
while
I'm
taking
a
bath
.
He
says
the
neighbors
complain
,
but
I
don't
believe
it
.
Why
don't
they
tell
me
themselves
if
it
bothers
them
''
?
?
The
man
closed
his
eyes
and
nodded
.
When
he
looked
up
again
,
he
seemed
almost
contented
.
``
Fine
.
Give
me
your
address
.
It
will
take
a
little
time
.
I
want
to
study
your
landlord's
habits
and
movements
first
.
You
see
,
I
always
make
it
look
like
an
accident
.
Maybe
suicide
,
if
it
looks
reasonable
.
In
that
way
there's
no
trouble
for
the
customer
''
.
Haney's
eyebrows
flew
up
.
``
Customer
''
?
?
Pete
smiled
modestly
.
``
It's
my
line
of
work
''
,
he
said
Five
minutes
later
,
before
Haney
could
make
his
break
,
the
stranger
stood
up
and
nodded
farewell
.
Haney
watched
the
small
but
wiry
man
slip
out
the
door
quickly
and
silently
,
and
felt
relieved
to
see
that
nobody
else
seemed
to
notice
his
departure
.
Phil
decided
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
and
as
time
passed
it
seemed
as
if
the
strange
little
man
had
never
been
there
,
but
for
the
other
glass
on
the
table
.
Some
time
before
midnight
he
returned
to
his
apartment
and
hit
the
sack
,
putting
the
whole
incident
out
of
mind
before
he
fell
asleep
.
The
next
day
,
Sunday
,
the
hangover
reminded
Haney
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
.
The
hangover
in
turn
reminded
him
of
his
conversation
with
the
weirdy
,
and
he
groaned
.
He
went
for
more
aspirin
later
in
the
day
,
and
passed
the
surly
landlord
on
the
way
--
he
was
still
alive
and
scowling
as
usual
,
as
if
tenants
were
a
burden
in
his
life
.
Phil
shrugged
and
ignored
him
.
He
went
back
to
work
Monday
.
By
Wednesday
the
landlord
was
still
alive
.
Of
course
On
Thursday
,
Haney
mailed
the
monthly
check
for
separate
maintenance
to
his
wife
Lolly
,
and
wished
the
stranger
could
do
something
about
her
Coming
home
from
work
,
he
was
startled
to
see
a
police
car
parked
in
front
of
the
apartment
building
.
Inside
the
lobby
,
people
were
standing
around
,
talking
excitedly
.
His
spine
crawled
with
a
foreboding
premonition
as
he
asked
one
of
his
fellow
tenants
what
had
happened
.
The
landlord
had
died
.
Late
that
afternoon
,
it
seemed
,
he
had
fallen
off
the
roof
while
on
some
obscure
errand
or
inspection
.
He
had
apparently
been
alone
.
Nobody
witnessed
the
fall
--
just
the
sickening
impact
when
his
body
smashed
on
the
pavement
just
outside
the
basement
delivery
entrance
.
Haney
hoped
that
nobody
noticed
his
sudden
pallor
,
as
he
felt
the
blood
drain
from
his
cheeks
.
He
muttered
something
about
how
terrible
it
was
,
and
walked
with
deliberate
slowness
to
the
elevator
.
Once
inside
his
apartment
,
he
poured
a
drink
with
trembling
hands
and
flopped
limply
in
a
chair
.
After
a
while
he
began
to
feel
better
about
it
,
especially
when
no
one
bothered
to
ask
any
questions
.
But
after
all
,
why
should
they
?
?
Still
later
,
he
finally
convinced
himself
that
it
was
an
accident
--
just
a
coincidence
.
The
stranger
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
of
course
Haney
went
to
bed
,
happy
that
at
least
he
was
rid
of
that
lousy
landlord
.
After
all
,
the
man
had
no
family
,
so
no
one
suffered
,
and
everybody
was
better
off
for
it
.
Really
,
he
said
to
himself
,
nobody
kills
a
man
just
as
a
favor
!
!
So
you
thought
I
didn't
mean
what
I
said
.
The
stranger's
eyes
were
large
and
sad
,
as
if
Phil
Haney
had
hurt
his
feelings
.
It
was
like
a
recurrent
,
annoying
dream
,
but
now
the
dream
was
beginning
to
take
on
overtones
of
a
nightmare
.
However
,
Haney
knew
it
was
not
a
dream
.
He
might
be
very
tight
,
but
he
knew
where
he
was
.
It
was
the
same
bar
,
and
it
was
two
weeks
later
--
Saturday
night
,
when
he
had
an
excuse
to
drink
heavier
than
usual
.
He
had
been
sitting
in
the
usual
corner
at
the
little
table
,
as
far
as
possible
from
any
talkative
,
friendly
lushes
.
He
was
enjoying
the
weekly
ritual
of
washing
down
his
pet
grievance
with
bourbon
slightly
moistened
with
water
.
This
favorite
grievance
was
not
the
landlord
.
He
had
already
quite
forgotten
about
him
.
In
fact
,
he
had
only
mentioned
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
His
real
grievance
was
Lolly
.
Toward
the
end
of
his
fourth
hairy
highball
,
while
he
was
moodily
making
wet
rings
on
the
table-top
with
the
bottom
of
the
glass
,
he
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
.
He
looked
up
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
beheld
the
stranger
sitting
across
the
table
,
smiling
a
secret
smile
at
him
,
as
if
they
were
fellow
conspirators
.
He
hadn't
even
noticed
--
what
was
his
name
?
?
Pete
?
?
--
he
hadn't
seen
him
sit
down
.
The
man
was
uncanny
,
like
a
shadow
,
and
made
as
much
noise
as
a
shadow
.
Haney
felt
like
shrinking
out
of
sight
,
but
he
was
already
trapped
in
the
corner
with
the
wiry
,
dark
little
man
.
He
began
to
wish
that
he
hadn't
shouted
that
other
evening
when
the
truck
bore
down
through
the
crossing
.
Was
he
going
to
be
saddled
from
now
on
with
a
creep
for
a
bar-buddy
?
?
He'd
have
to
start
going
to
some
of
the
other
places
again
.
In
a
low
voice
,
almost
whispering
,
the
man
had
asked
Phil
if
he
was
happy
with
the
way
the
landlord
had
been
taken
off
his
back
.
He
made
the
mistake
of
answering
in
an
offhand
way
,
and
instantly
realized
that
his
skepticism
must
have
showed
in
his
face
or
voice
.
Pete
frowned
slightly
,
then
became
sad
and
moody
.
Haney
didn't
want
to
encourage
his
company
,
but
felt
he
ought
to
buy
him
a
drink
anyhow
,
to
prevent
possible
trouble
.
But
there
was
no
trouble
.
The
guy
sulked
over
his
drink
,
obviously
upset
by
Haney's
lack
of
appreciation
.
To
break
the
uncomfortable
silence
,
Haney
began
to
talk
.
In
time
,
and
two
drinks
later
,
he
was
complaining
bitterly
about
his
wife
,
He
was
on
the
subject
for
ten
minutes
or
so
when
he
noticed
the
renewed
interest
in
his
listener
--
it
showed
in
the
alert
face
and
the
suddenly
bright
eyes
.
When
he
paused
to
moisten
his
throat
,
the
stranger
broke
in
.
``
But
why
pay
her
bills
?
?
If
she
runs
around
with
other
men
,
and
if
you
hate
her
as
you
say
,
why
not
just
divorce
her
''
?
?
Haney
scowled
.
``
That
bitch
would
love
a
divorce
''
,
he
growled
.
``
Then
she'd
get
half
of
everything
I
have
.
Community
property
deal
--
you
know
.
I'd
have
to
sell
out
my
business
to
pay
her
off
with
her
share
.
She
can
drop
dead
''
!
!
Pete
nodded
understandingly
.
``
Oh
yes
.
Now
I
see
.
You
must
understand
,
I
haven't
been
in
this
state
too
long
.
I
came
out
here
to
retire
.
That's
why
I
--
why
I
do
a
free
job
now
and
then
.
You
should
have
told
me
about
her
before
''
.
Haney
felt
a
twinge
of
annoyance
when
he
heard
the
now
familiar
line
again
.
Then
a
wild
thought
ran
circles
through
his
clouded
brain
.
Suppose
--
just
suppose
this
guy
was
really
what
he
said
he
was
!
!
A
retired
professional
killer
If
he
was
just
a
nut
,
no
harm
was
done
.
But
if
he
was
the
real
thing
,
he
could
do
something
about
Lolly
.
He
felt
very
cunning
,
very
proud
of
himself
as
he
played
on
the
other
man's
soft
spot
.
``
No
offense
intended
''
,
he
said
gently
.
``
But
it's
just
that
--
well
,
you
know
.
The
cops
didn't
suspect
a
thing
,
and
I
thought
it
was
a
coincidence
.
After
all
,
I
didn't
know
you
,
Pete
.
It
could
have
been
an
accident
''
.
He
shrugged
casually
.
``
But
if
you
say
you
managed
it
''
The
stranger
was
hooked
.
His
eyes
burned
feverishly
.
``
Yes
,
yes
''
,
he
muttered
impatiently
.
``
Of
course
it
looked
like
an
accident
.
I
always
work
it
that
way
--
and
always
at
a
time
when
the
customer
has
an
alibi
.
Let
me
prove
it
,
Phil
.
I
think
I
can
manage
one
more
favor
for
you
''
.
He
waited
eagerly
.
Haney
swished
the
liquor
in
the
bottom
of
his
glass
.
About
halfway
back
Pops
groped
against
a
wall
and
stopped
,
pulled
away
two
loosely
nailed
wide
boards
at
one
end
,
and
went
through
.
``
C'mon
''
,
he
whispered
;
;
``
floor
level's
about
three
feet
down
,
so
don't
fall
''
.
I
went
through
and
down
,
into
pitch
darkness
.
He
said
,
``
Jist
stay
still
.
I'll
pull
the
boards
back
and
then
get
us
a
light
.
Jist
stay
where
you
are
''
.
I
jist
stayed
where
I
was
while
he
fumbled
around
and
then
walked
away
.
A
moment
later
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
candle
,
and
I
could
see
.
It
was
a
big
room
,
empty
except
for
a
few
things
of
Pops's
at
the
far
end
--
a
wooden
crate
on
which
stood
the
candle
,
a
spread
out
blanket
,
and
an
unrolled
bindle
.
I
looked
back
over
my
shoulder
while
I
went
to
join
him
;
;
he'd
hung
another
half
of
a
blanket
over
the
boarded
window
so
no
light
would
show
through
.
I
took
the
pint
bottle
from
my
pocket
and
handed
it
over
as
I
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
spread
blanket
.
``
You
first
''
,
I
said
.
He
drank
and
handed
it
back
.
``
Nice
place
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
Listen
,
I
got
a
buddy
I
travel
with
,
real
nice
guy
named
Larry
.
I
know
where
he
is
,
right
near
here
.
Could
he
join
the
party
and
sleep
here
tonight
too
?
?
We'll
both
be
blowing
town
tomorrow
so
we
won't
be
moving
in
on
you
''
.
He
hesitated
a
second
,
looking
at
the
bottle
,
before
he
said
``
Sure-sure
''
,
and
I
reassured
him
.
``
He'll
bring
a
bottle
too
,
and
I'll
get
another
one
or
maybe
two
while
I'm
out
.
You
can
work
on
this
one
while
I'm
gone
,
kill
it
if
you
want
''
.
I
took
a
short
swallow
from
it
myself
and
handed
it
to
him
.
His
``
sure-sure
''
was
enthusiastic
this
time
.
He
put
the
bottle
down
.
``
Git
over
by
the
window
while
there's
light
,
an'
I'll
put
th'
candle
out
.
When
yuh
come
back
I'll
put
it
out
agin
till
you're
both
inside
''
.
Charlie
was
waiting
,
leaning
against
a
building
front
.
``
Perfect
set-up
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
But
we
got
to
go
back
to
Fifth
and
get
another
bottle
or
two
.
On
the
way
I'll
give
you
the
scoop
''
.
On
the
way
I
gave
him
the
scoop
.
I
bought
another
pint
of
sherry
and
when
we
got
back
Pops
let
us
in
in
the
dark
,
put
back
the
blanket
and
then
lighted
the
candle
again
.
I
introduced
my
friend
Larry
to
Pops
and
we
made
ourselves
comfortable
.
There
was
still
a
little
,
not
much
,
left
in
the
first
bottle
and
we
passed
it
around
once
and
killed
it
,
and
Charlie
opened
his
.
I
was
reminded
,
amusedly
,
by
a
poem
of
Kenneth
Patchen's
called
The
Murder
of
Two
Men
by
a
Young
Kid
Wearing
Lemon
Colored
Gloves
,
which
Patchen
himself
read
on
a
record
against
jazz
background
.
The
poem
consisted
of
only
two
words
,
the
word
``
Wait
''
,
repeated
over
and
over
at
irregular
intervals
and
with
different
inflections
,
and
then
the
word
``
Now
''
!
!
And
a
blaring
final
chord
from
the
jazz
group
.
This
was
the
same
,
except
that
it
was
the
murder
of
one
man
by
two
men
and
neither
of
us
was
wearing
gloves
.
But
we
could
wait
all
right
;
;
there
was
no
hurry
.
I
said
,
``
Wait
wait
''
to
Charlie
and
he
grinned
,
digging
the
reference
.
We'd
heard
the
record
together
once
.
The
second
bottle
passed
a
few
times
.
Pops
was
taking
long
ones
,
but
not
showing
the
effect
yet
.
He
seemed
as
drunk
as
when
I'd
first
talked
to
him
,
but
no
drunker
.
He
had
a
capacity
;
;
if
we'd
really
been
trying
to
get
him
dead
drunk
we'd
have
had
to
go
out
for
more
wine
.
About
halfway
through
the
second
bottle
,
Charlie
looked
at
me
across
Pops
,
who
was
sitting
between
us
and
asked
``
Now
''
?
?
I
said
,
``
Wait
''
,
and
handed
the
bottle
to
Pops
for
his
final
drink
.
When
he
handed
it
back
and
I
had
hold
of
it
safely
,
Pops
was
looking
toward
me
and
I
said
``
Now
''
,
to
Charlie
and
he
swung
the
short
length
of
lead
pipe
he'd
meanwhile
taken
from
his
pocket
,
once
.
It
was
a
lead
pipe
cinch
.
There
was
a
sound
like
the
one
you
produce
by
flicking
a
watermelon
with
your
finger
,
only
louder
,
and
Pops
fell
forward
from
the
waist
and
then
over
sidewise
.
Out
cold
,
if
not
dead
;
;
and
he'd
never
known
what
hit
him
--
he'd
never
known
that
anything
had
hit
him
.
I
reached
my
hand
toward
him
to
put
it
inside
his
shirt
to
feel
for
a
heartbeat
,
but
Charlie
said
``
Wait
''
!
!
--
and
said
it
sharply
,
not
as
in
the
Patchen
bit
,
but
as
an
order
--
so
I
stopped
my
hand
and
looked
at
him
.
He
was
holding
the
piece
of
lead
pipe
out
to
me
.
``
We
don't
want
to
know
whether
he's
dead
,
yet
.
I
gauged
that
blow
to
be
borderline
.
To
kayo
him
and
maybe
or
maybe
not
kill
.
You
hit
again
about
twice
that
hard
before
we
know
whether
he's
dead
or
not
.
That
way
we'll
never
know
which
of
us
really
killed
him
and
which
was
just
the
accomplice
.
Dig
''
?
?
I
dug
him
,
I
saw
his
point
;
;
it
made
sense
.
I
took
the
piece
of
pipe
from
Charlie's
hand
and
used
it
,
harder
than
he
had
.
The
thunk
was
louder
,
anyway
,
and
I
thought
I
heard
bone
crack
.
Charlie
said
,
``
Good
boy
.
That
did
it
,
if
mine
didn't
.
And
we'll
never
know
which
.
All
right
,
now
I'll
give
you
a
hand
''
.
We
straightened
Pops
up
and
I
made
sure
there
was
no
trace
of
a
heartbeat
.
I
nodded
to
Charlie
.
``
Let's
put
him
down
again
the
way
he
was
.
It's
a
more
natural
position
''
.
We
did
that
.
``
How
do
you
feel
''
?
?
Charlie
asked
me
.
``
Cool
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
What
do
you
feel
''
?
?
``
Nothing
.
Well
maybe
I'm
exaggerating
.
It
was
a
kick
,
but
not
a
big
enough
one
for
me
to
want
to
take
the
chance
again
,
except
for
stakes
.
But
let's
not
talk
about
it
abstractly
until
we're
out
of
here
.
Now
,
first
question
:
the
bottles
.
Shall
we
take
them
all
with
us
,
or
leave
one
''
?
?
``
Take
them
''
,
I
said
.
``
If
we
left
one
we'd
have
to
wipe
it
for
fingerprints
.
Here's
the
picture
we
want
to
leave
for
the
fuzz
--
whenever
the
body
gets
found
.
This
happened
in
the
middle
of
a
drinking
bout
with
another
bum
.
If
they'd
been
working
on
a
bottle
or
a
jug
he'd
have
taken
it
with
him
''
.
``
Right
.
And
he'd
have
taken
the
weapon
with
him
too
,
so
we
take
that
.
Now
''
--
He
looked
around
.
``
I've
been
careful
about
fingerprints
.
How
about
you
''
?
?
``
Same
.
There
are
the
boards
over
the
window
,
of
course
,
but
they're
not
painted
and
too
rough
to
take
prints
.
Same
goes
for
the
rough
cement
of
the
ledge
.
Besides
,
I
doubt
if
the
cops
will
even
try
dusting
.
They
find
dead
winos
every
day
,
maybe
they
won't
even
autopsy
him
for
the
cause
of
death
''
.
``
We
can't
take
a
chance
on
that
.
We've
got
to
assume
they'll
decide
he
was
murdered
and
we've
got
to
keep
the
picture
consistent
.
Our
hypothetical
other
bum
who
killed
him
would
have
turned
out
his
pockets
.
Let's
do
that
''
.
We
did
that
and
found
a
dirty
handkerchief
,
some
matches
and
fourteen
cents
in
change
.
We
took
the
matches
--
they
were
book
matches
and
once
they'd
been
touched
might
retain
fingerprints
--
and
the
change
.
We
discussed
the
candle
and
decided
the
hypothetical
other
bum
would
have
left
it
burning
to
light
his
way
to
the
window
and
because
he'd
have
no
reason
to
blow
it
out
.
The
candle
had
been
stuck
on
a
tin
lid
so
it
wouldn't
set
fire
to
the
crate
when
it
guttered
out
.
A
fire
wouldn't
have
mattered
except
that
it
would
cause
Pops
to
be
found
sooner
.
He
might
not
be
found
for
days
,
even
weeks
,
otherwise
.
We
went
once
more
over
every
point
,
then
triple-checked
.
Being
picked
up
for
questioning
by
a
cop
on
the
way
out
seemed
to
be
the
only
possible
remaining
danger
,
and
we
weren't
picked
up
by
a
cop
.
In
fact
,
nobody
saw
us
,
cop
or
citizen
.
Winsett
is
a
quiet
street
with
no
taverns
and
was
completely
deserted
at
that
hour
.
Which
,
if
it
matters
,
was
one
A.M.
.
Less
than
three
hours
ago
we'd
decided
,
in
Maxine
Wells's
pad
on
Cosmo
,
to
commit
a
trial
murder
.
It
had
gone
like
clockwork
.
Almost
too
smoothly
,
I
found
myself
thinking
,
and
then
told
myself
that
was
ridiculous
.
How
safe
is
too
safe
?
?
Thinking
like
that
can
get
you
into
a
padded
pad
.
An
hour
later
we
were
back
in
my
unpadded
pad
,
killing
what
had
been
left
of
the
second
pint
.
We
decided
to
leave
the
third
one
intact
for
tomorrow
.
Also
our
plans
for
me
to
commit
Charlie's
murder
and
for
him
to
commit
mine
.
But
we
were
really
going
to
do
it
.
We
shook
hands
on
it
.
We
planned
ahead
only
one
step
,
a
rendezvous
for
tomorrow
when
we
could
swap
notes
.
I'd
tell
him
everything
I'd
learned
about
Seaton's
habits
and
habitat
,
and
he'd
tell
me
the
score
on
Radic
.
We
made
the
date
for
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
at
Maxine
Wells's
pad
.
Charlie
would
get
there
early
because
he
had
the
key
.
From
here
on
in
,
the
less
Charlie
and
I
were
seen
together
in
public
,
or
visited
one
another's
rooms
,
the
better
.
I
was
dead
tired
and
slept
soundly
,
as
far
as
I
know
dreamlessly
.
We
met
at
Maxine's
and
decided
we
were
set
to
stay
as
long
as
it
took
,
into
or
even
through
the
evening
,
to
talk
things
out
.
Charlie
had
brought
food
and
we'd
decided
on
no
drinks
.
I'd
brought
along
the
virgin
pint
from
last
night
,
but
we
were
going
to
kill
that
only
when
we
were
through
talking
.
I
talked
first
,
telling
him
everything
I
knew
about
Seaton
and
his
house
and
domestic
arrangements
.
I
drew
diagrams
and
floor
plans
;
;
he
memorized
them
thoroughly
and
then
we
tore
them
into
tiny
pieces
and
flushed
them
down
.
He
gave
me
equivalent
and
even
more
detailed
dope
on
Radic
,
including
diagrams
--
one
of
the
apartment
building
Radic
lived
in
and
one
of
the
apartment
itself
.
He'd
been
there
several
times
,
back
when
,
while
he
and
Radic
had
been
friends
,
or
at
least
not
enemies
.
It
didn't
take
us
as
long
as
we'd
thought
it
might
;
;
it
was
not
quite
six
o'clock
when
we
finished
and
Charlie
said
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
that's
it
.
Shall
we
flip
a
coin
to
see
which
of
us
goes
first
?
?
Or
would
you
rather
deal
a
hand
of
show-down
poker
or
play
a
game
of
gin
rummy
,
or
what
''
?
?
``
Wait
a
minute
,
Charlie
''
,
I
said
.
``
One
thing
we
haven't
discussed
,
expense
money
.
We'll
need
some
at
least
,
if
only
bus
fare
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
.
And
if
you're
as
flat
broke
as
I
am
,
I
think
we'll
have
to
take
the
added
risk
of
knocking
over
a
filling
station
or
something
before
we
split
for
one
of
us
to
set
up
an
alibi
while
the
other
does
his
dirty
work
''
.
He
sighed
.
``
All
right
,
I'll
come
clean
.
I've
got
a
little
stashed
for
a
rainy
day
,
and
I
guess
this
is
rainy
enough
.
A
couple
of
hundred
.
If
you
draw
the
short
straw
I'll
lend
you
some
bread
,
like
fifty
bucks
,
before
I
take
off
to
visit
my
sister
in
Frisco
.
Then
,
after
I'm
back
,
another
fifty
so
you
can
put
some
mileage
on
yourself
and
have
a
solid
alibi
somewhere
while
I
take
care
of
your
seat
cover
boy
''
.
``
Solid
''
,
I
said
.
I
took
a
deep
breath
,
and
the
plunge
.
``
In
that
case
,
let's
not
draw
.
I'll
go
to
bat
first
.
You'd
have
to
wait
till
Seaton's
back
from
Mexico
City
and
also
while
I
set
it
up
with
Doris
to
have
her
have
an
alibi
for
D-night
.
So
it
wouldn't
be
for
days
or
even
a
week
before
you
could
do
anything
.
But
your
friend
Manny
can
go
any
time
''
.
He
grinned
and
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
.
``
I
was
hoping
you'd
say
that
,
Willy
.
But
I
wouldn't
have
suggested
it
.
Well
--
in
that
case
,
I
take
off
tomorrow
morning
for
Frisco
.
And
,
in
case
,
I
brought
the
money
with
me
''
.
Now
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
self
he
was
free
to
grok
ever
closer
to
his
brothers
,
merge
without
let
.
Self's
integrity
was
and
is
and
ever
had
been
.
Mike
stopped
to
cherish
all
his
brother
selves
,
the
many
threes-fulfilled
on
Mars
,
corporate
and
discorporate
,
the
precious
few
on
Earth
--
the
unknown
powers
of
three
on
Earth
that
would
be
his
to
merge
with
and
cherish
now
that
at
last
long
waiting
he
grokked
and
cherished
himself
.
Mike
remained
in
trance
;
;
there
was
much
to
grok
,
loose
ends
to
puzzle
over
and
fit
into
his
growing
--
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
been
at
the
Archangel
Foster
Tabernacle
(
not
just
cusp
when
he
and
Digby
had
come
face
to
face
alone
)
why
Bishop
Senator
Boone
made
him
warily
uneasy
,
how
Miss
Dawn
Ardent
tasted
like
a
water
brother
when
she
was
not
,
the
smell
of
goodness
he
had
incompletely
grokked
in
the
jumping
up
and
down
and
wailing
--
Jubal's
conversations
coming
and
going
--
Jubal's
words
troubled
him
most
;
;
he
studied
them
,
compared
them
with
what
he
had
been
taught
as
a
nestling
,
struggling
to
bridge
between
languages
,
the
one
he
thought
with
and
the
one
he
was
learning
to
think
in
.
The
word
``
church
''
which
turned
up
over
and
over
again
among
Jubal's
words
gave
him
knotty
difficulty
;
;
there
was
no
Martian
concept
to
match
it
--
unless
one
took
``
church
''
and
``
worship
''
and
``
God
''
and
``
congregation
''
and
many
other
words
and
equated
them
to
the
totality
of
the
only
world
he
had
known
during
growing-waiting
then
forced
the
concept
back
into
English
in
that
phrase
which
had
been
rejected
(
by
each
differently
)
by
Jubal
,
by
Mahmoud
,
by
Digby
.
``
Thou
art
God
''
.
He
was
closer
to
understanding
it
in
English
now
,
although
it
could
never
have
the
inevitability
of
the
Martian
concept
it
stood
for
.
In
his
mind
he
spoke
simultaneously
the
English
sentence
and
the
Martian
word
and
felt
closer
grokking
.
Repeating
it
like
a
student
telling
himself
that
the
jewel
is
in
the
lotus
he
sank
into
nirvana
.
Before
midnight
he
speeded
his
heart
,
resumed
normal
breathing
,
ran
down
his
check
list
,
uncurled
and
sat
up
.
He
had
been
weary
;
;
now
he
felt
light
and
gay
and
clear-headed
,
ready
for
the
many
actions
he
saw
spreading
out
before
him
.
He
felt
a
puppyish
need
for
company
as
strong
as
his
earlier
necessity
for
quiet
.
He
stepped
out
into
the
hall
,
was
delighted
to
encounter
a
water
brother
.
``
Hi
''
!
!
``
Oh
.
Hello
,
Mike
.
My
,
you
look
chipper
''
.
``
I
feel
fine
!
!
Where
is
everybody
''
?
?
``
Asleep
.
Ben
and
Stinky
went
home
an
hour
ago
and
people
started
going
to
bed
''
.
``
Oh
''
.
Mike
felt
disappointed
that
Mahmoud
had
left
;
;
he
wanted
to
explain
his
new
grokking
.
``
I
ought
to
be
asleep
,
too
,
but
I
felt
like
a
snack
.
Are
you
hungry
''
?
?
``
Sure
,
I'm
hungry
''
!
!
``
Come
on
,
there's
some
cold
chicken
and
we'll
see
what
else
''
.
They
went
downstairs
,
loaded
a
tray
lavishly
.
``
Let's
take
it
outside
.
It's
plenty
warm
''
.
``
A
fine
idea
''
,
Mike
agreed
.
``
Warm
enough
to
swim
--
real
Indian
summer
.
I'll
switch
on
the
floods
''
.
``
Don't
bother
''
,
Mike
answered
.
``
I'll
carry
the
tray
''
.
He
could
see
in
almost
total
darkness
.
Jubal
said
that
his
night-sight
probably
came
from
the
conditions
in
which
he
had
grown
up
,
and
Mike
grokked
this
was
true
but
grokked
that
there
was
more
to
it
;
;
his
foster
parents
had
taught
him
to
see
.
As
for
the
night
being
warm
,
he
would
have
been
comfortable
naked
on
Mount
Everest
but
his
water
brothers
had
little
tolerance
for
changes
in
temperature
and
pressure
;
;
he
was
considerate
of
their
weakness
,
once
he
learned
of
it
.
But
he
was
looking
forward
to
snow
--
seeing
for
himself
that
each
tiny
crystal
of
the
water
of
life
was
a
unique
individual
,
as
he
had
read
--
walking
barefoot
,
rolling
in
it
.
In
the
meantime
he
was
pleased
with
the
warm
night
and
the
still
more
pleasing
company
of
his
water
brother
.
``
Okay
,
take
the
tray
.
I'll
switch
on
the
underwater
lights
.
That'll
be
plenty
to
eat
by
''
.
``
Fine
''
.
Mike
liked
having
light
up
through
the
ripples
;
;
it
was
a
goodness
,
beauty
.
They
picnicked
by
the
pool
,
then
lay
back
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
stars
.
``
Mike
,
there's
Mars
.
It
is
Mars
,
isn't
it
?
?
Or
Antares
''
?
?
``
It
is
Mars
''
.
``
Mike
?
?
What
are
they
doing
on
Mars
''
?
?
He
hesitated
;
;
the
question
was
too
wide
for
the
sparse
English
language
.
``
On
the
side
toward
the
horizon
--
the
southern
hemisphere
--
it
is
spring
;
;
plants
are
being
taught
to
grow
''
.
``
'
Taught
to
grow
'
''
?
?
He
hesitated
.
``
Larry
teaches
plants
to
grow
.
I
have
helped
him
.
But
my
people
--
Martians
,
I
mean
;
;
I
now
grok
you
are
my
people
--
teach
plants
another
way
.
In
the
other
hemisphere
it
is
growing
colder
and
nymphs
,
those
who
stayed
alive
through
the
summer
,
are
being
brought
into
nests
for
quickening
and
more
growing
''
.
He
thought
.
``
Of
the
humans
we
left
at
the
equator
,
one
has
discorporated
and
the
others
are
sad
''
.
Yes
,
I
heard
it
in
the
news
''
.
Mike
had
not
heard
it
;
;
he
had
not
known
it
until
asked
.
``
They
should
not
be
sad
.
Mr.
Booker
T.
W.
Jones
Food
Technician
First
Class
is
not
sad
;
;
the
Old
Ones
have
cherished
him
''
.
``
You
knew
him
''
?
?
``
Yes
.
He
had
his
own
face
,
dark
and
beautiful
.
But
he
was
homesick
''
.
``
Oh
,
dear
!
!
Mike
do
you
ever
get
homesick
?
?
For
Mars
''
?
?
``
At
first
I
was
homesick
''
,
he
answered
.
``
I
was
lonely
always
''
.
He
rolled
toward
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
``
But
now
I
am
not
lonely
.
I
grok
I
shall
never
be
lonely
again
''
.
``
Mike
darling
''
--
They
kissed
,
and
went
on
kissing
.
Presently
his
water
brother
said
breathlessly
.
``
Oh
,
my
!
!
That
was
almost
worse
than
the
first
time
''
.
``
You
are
all
right
,
my
brother
''
?
?
``
Yes
.
Yes
indeed
.
Kiss
me
again
''
.
A
long
time
later
,
by
cosmic
clock
,
she
said
,
``
Mike
?
?
Is
that
--
I
mean
,
'
Do
you
know
'
''
--
``
I
know
.
It
is
for
growing
closer
.
Now
we
grow
closer
''
.
``
Well
I've
been
ready
a
long
time
--
goodness
,
we
all
have
,
but
never
mind
,
dear
;
;
turn
just
a
little
.
I'll
help
''
.
As
they
merged
,
grokking
together
,
Mike
said
softly
and
triumphantly
:
``
Thou
art
God
''
.
Her
answer
was
not
in
words
.
Then
,
as
their
grokking
made
them
ever
closer
and
Mike
felt
himself
almost
ready
to
discorporate
her
voice
called
him
back
:
``
Oh
!
!
Oh
!
!
Thou
art
God
''
!
!
``
We
grok
God
''
.

On
Mars
humans
were
building
pressure
domes
for
the
male
and
female
party
that
would
arrive
by
next
ship
.
This
went
faster
than
scheduled
as
the
Martians
were
helpful
.
Part
of
the
time
saved
was
spent
on
a
preliminary
estimate
for
a
long-distance
plan
to
free
bound
oxygen
in
the
sands
of
Mars
to
make
the
planet
more
friendly
to
future
human
generations
.
The
Old
Ones
neither
helped
nor
hindered
this
plan
;
;
time
was
not
yet
.
Their
meditations
were
approaching
a
violent
cusp
that
would
shape
Martian
art
for
many
millennia
.
On
Earth
elections
continued
and
a
very
advanced
poet
published
a
limited
edition
of
verse
consisting
entirely
of
punctuation
marks
and
spaces
;
;
Time
magazine
reviewed
it
and
suggested
that
the
Federation
Assembly
Daily
Record
should
be
translated
into
the
medium
.
A
colossal
campaign
opened
to
sell
more
sexual
organs
of
plants
and
Mrs.
Joseph
(
``
Shadow
of
Greatness
''
)
Douglas
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
I
would
no
more
sit
down
without
flowers
on
my
table
than
without
serviettes
''
.
A
Tibetan
swami
from
Palermo
,
Sicily
,
announced
in
Beverly
Hills
a
newly
discovered
,
ancient
yoga
discipline
for
ripple
breathing
which
increased
both
pranha
and
cosmic
attraction
between
sexes
.
His
chelas
were
required
to
assume
the
matsyendra
posture
dressed
in
hand-woven
diapers
while
he
read
aloud
from
Rig-Veda
and
an
assistant
guru
examined
their
purses
in
another
room
--
nothing
was
stolen
;
;
the
purpose
was
less
immediate
.
The
President
of
the
United
States
proclaimed
the
first
Sunday
in
November
as
``
National
Grandmothers'
Day
''
and
urged
America
to
say
it
with
flowers
.
A
funeral
parlor
chain
was
indicted
for
price-cutting
.
Fosterite
bishops
,
after
secret
conclave
,
announced
the
Church's
second
Major
Miracle
:
Supreme
Bishop
Digby
had
been
translated
bodily
to
Heaven
and
spot-promoted
to
Archangel
,
ranking
with-but-after
Archangel
Foster
.
The
glorious
news
had
been
held
up
pending
Heavenly
confirmation
of
the
elevation
of
a
new
Supreme
Bishop
,
Huey
Short
--
a
candidate
accepted
by
the
Boone
faction
after
lots
had
been
cast
repeatedly
.
L'Unita
and
Hoy
published
identical
denunciations
of
Short's
elevation
,
l'Osservatore
Romano
and
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
ignored
it
,
Times
of
India
snickered
at
it
,
and
the
Manchester
Guardian
simply
reported
it
--
the
Fosterites
in
England
were
few
but
extremely
militant
.
Digby
was
not
pleased
with
his
promotion
.
The
Man
from
Mars
had
interrupted
him
with
his
work
half
finished
--
and
that
stupid
jackass
Short
was
certain
to
louse
it
up
.
Foster
listened
with
angelic
patience
until
Digby
ran
down
,
then
said
,
``
Listen
,
junior
,
you're
an
angel
now
--
so
forget
it
.
Eternity
is
no
time
for
recriminations
.
You
too
were
a
stupid
jackass
until
you
poisoned
me
.
Afterwards
you
did
well
enough
.
Now
that
Short
is
Supreme
Bishop
he'll
do
all
right
,
he
can't
help
it
.
Same
as
with
the
Popes
.
Some
of
them
were
warts
until
they
got
promoted
.
Check
with
one
of
them
,
go
ahead
--
there's
no
professional
jealousy
here
''
.
Digby
calmed
down
,
but
made
one
request
.
Foster
shook
his
halo
.
``
You
can't
touch
him
.
You
shouldn't
have
tried
to
.
Oh
,
you
can
submit
a
requisition
for
a
miracle
if
you
want
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
But
,
I'm
telling
you
,
it'll
be
turned
down
--
you
don't
understand
the
System
yet
.
The
Martians
have
their
own
setup
,
different
from
ours
,
and
as
long
as
they
need
him
,
we
can't
touch
him
.
They
run
their
show
their
way
--
the
Universe
has
variety
,
something
for
everybody
--
a
fact
you
field
workers
often
miss
''
.
``
You
mean
this
punk
can
brush
me
aside
and
I've
got
to
hold
still
for
it
''
?
?
``
I
held
still
for
the
same
thing
,
didn't
I
?
?
I'm
helping
you
now
,
am
I
not
?
?
Now
look
,
there's
work
to
be
done
and
lots
of
it
.
The
Boss
wants
performance
,
not
gripes
.
If
you
need
a
Day
off
to
calm
down
,
duck
over
to
the
Muslim
Paradise
and
take
it
.
Otherwise
,
straighten
your
halo
,
square
your
wings
,
and
dig
in
.
The
sooner
you
act
like
an
angel
the
quicker
you'll
feel
angelic
.
Get
Happy
,
junior
''
!
!
Digby
heaved
a
deep
ethereal
sigh
.
``
Okay
,
I'm
Happy
.
Where
do
I
start
''
?
?
Jubal
did
not
hear
of
Digby's
disappearance
when
it
was
announced
,
and
,
when
he
did
,
while
he
had
a
fleeting
suspicion
,
he
dismissed
it
;
;
if
Mike
had
had
a
finger
in
it
,
he
had
gotten
away
with
it
--
and
what
happened
to
supreme
bishops
worried
Jubal
not
at
all
as
long
as
he
wasn't
bothered
.
His
household
had
gone
through
an
upset
.
Jubal
deduced
what
had
happened
but
did
not
know
with
whom
--
and
didn't
want
to
inquire
.
Mike
was
of
legal
age
and
presumed
able
to
defend
himself
in
the
clinches
.
Anyhow
,
it
was
high
time
the
boy
was
salted
.
Jubal
couldn't
reconstruct
the
crime
from
the
way
the
girls
behaved
because
patterns
kept
shifting
--
ABC
vs
D
,
then
BCD
vs
A
or
AB
vs
CD
,
or
AD
vs
CB
,
through
all
ways
that
four
women
can
gang
up
on
each
other
.
This
continued
most
of
the
week
following
that
ill-starred
trip
to
church
,
during
which
period
Mike
stayed
in
his
room
and
usually
in
a
trance
so
deep
that
Jubal
would
have
pronounced
him
dead
had
he
not
seen
it
before
.
Jubal
would
not
have
minded
it
if
service
had
not
gone
to
pieces
.
The
girls
seemed
to
spend
half
their
time
tiptoeing
in
``
to
see
if
Mike
was
all
right
''
and
they
were
too
preoccupied
to
cook
,
much
less
be
secretaries
.
Even
rock-steady
Anne
--
Hell
,
Anne
was
the
worst
!
!
Absent-minded
,
subject
to
unexplained
tears
Jubal
would
have
bet
his
life
that
if
Anne
were
to
witness
the
Second
Coming
,
she
would
memorize
date
,
time
,
personae
,
events
,
and
barometric
pressure
without
batting
her
calm
blue
eyes
.
The
expense
and
time
involved
are
astronomical
.
However
,
we
sent
a
third
vessel
out
,
a
much
smaller
and
faster
one
than
the
first
two
.
We
have
learned
much
about
interstellar
drives
since
a
hundred
years
ago
;
;
that
is
all
I
can
tell
you
about
them
.
``
But
the
third
ship
came
back
several
years
ago
and
reported
''
``
That
it
had
found
a
planet
on
which
human
beings
could
live
and
which
was
already
inhabited
by
sentient
beings
''
!
!
Said
Hal
,
forgetting
in
his
enthusiasm
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
speak
.
Macneff
stopped
pacing
to
stare
at
Hal
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
.
``
How
did
you
know
''
?
?
He
said
sharply
.
``
Forgive
me
,
Sandalphon
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
it
was
inevitable
!
!
Did
not
the
Forerunner
predict
in
his
Time
and
the
World
Line
that
such
a
planet
would
be
found
?
?
I
believe
it
was
on
page
573
''
!
!
Macneff
smiled
and
said
,
``
I
am
glad
that
your
scriptural
lessons
have
left
such
an
impression
''
.
How
could
they
not
?
?
Thought
Hal
.
Besides
,
they
were
not
the
only
impressions
.
I
still
bear
scars
on
my
back
where
Pornsen
,
my
gapt
,
whipped
me
because
I
had
not
learned
my
lessons
well
enough
.
He
was
a
good
impresser
,
that
Pornsen
.
Was
?
?
Is
!
!
As
I
grew
older
and
was
promoted
,
so
was
he
,
always
where
I
was
.
He
was
my
gapt
in
the
creche
.
He
was
the
dormitory
gapt
when
I
went
to
college
and
thought
I
was
getting
away
from
him
.
He
is
now
my
block
gapt
.
He
is
the
one
responsible
for
my
getting
such
low
M.
R.'s
.
Swiftly
,
came
the
revulsion
,
the
protest
.
No
,
not
he
,
for
I
,
and
I
alone
,
am
responsible
for
whatever
happens
to
me
.
If
I
get
a
low
M.
R.
,
I
do
so
because
I
want
it
that
way
or
my
dark
self
does
.
If
I
die
,
I
die
because
I
willed
it
so
.
So
,
forgive
me
,
Sigmen
,
for
the
contrary-to-reality
thoughts
!
!
``
Please
pardon
me
again
,
Sandalphon
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
did
the
expedition
find
any
records
of
the
Forerunner
having
been
on
this
planet
?
?
Perhaps
,
even
,
though
this
is
too
much
to
wish
,
find
the
Forerunner
himself
''
?
?
``
No
''
,
said
Macneff
.
``
Though
that
does
not
mean
that
there
may
not
be
such
records
there
.
The
expedition
was
under
orders
to
make
a
swift
survey
of
conditions
and
then
to
return
to
Earth
.
I
can't
tell
you
now
the
distance
in
lightyears
or
what
star
this
was
,
though
you
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
at
night
in
this
hemisphere
.
If
you
volunteer
,
you
will
be
told
where
you're
going
after
the
ship
leaves
.
And
it
leaves
very
soon
''
.
``
You
need
a
linguist
''
?
?
Said
Hal
.
``
The
ship
is
huge
''
,
said
Macneff
,
``
but
the
number
of
military
men
and
specialists
we
are
taking
limits
the
linguists
to
one
.
We
have
considered
several
of
your
professionals
because
they
were
lamechians
and
above
suspicion
.
Unfortunately
''
Hal
waited
:
Macneff
paced
some
more
,
frowning
.
Then
,
he
said
,
``
Unfortunately
,
only
one
lamechian
linguist
exists
,
and
he
is
too
old
for
this
expedition
.
Therefore
''
``
A
thousand
pardons
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
I
have
just
thought
of
one
thing
.
I
am
married
''
.
``
No
problem
at
all
''
,
said
Macneff
.
``
There
will
be
no
women
aboard
the
Gabriel
.
And
,
if
a
man
is
married
,
he
will
automatically
be
given
a
divorce
''
.
Hal
gasped
,
and
he
said
,
``
A
divorce
''
?
?
Macneff
raised
his
hands
apologetically
and
said
,
``
You
are
horrified
,
of
course
.
But
,
from
our
reading
of
the
Western
Talmud
,
we
Urielites
believe
that
the
Forerunner
,
knowing
this
situation
would
arise
,
made
reference
to
and
provision
for
divorce
.
It's
inevitable
in
this
case
,
for
the
couple
will
be
separated
for
,
at
the
least
,
forty
years
.
Naturally
,
he
couched
the
provision
in
obscure
language
.
In
his
great
and
glorious
wisdom
,
he
knew
that
our
enemies
the
Israelites
must
not
be
able
to
read
therein
what
we
planned
''
.
``
I
volunteer
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
Tell
me
more
,
Sandalphon
''
.
Six
months
later
,
Hal
Yarrow
stood
in
the
observation
dome
of
the
Gabriel
and
watched
the
ball
of
Earth
dwindle
above
him
.
It
was
night
on
this
hemisphere
,
but
the
light
blazed
from
the
megalopolises
of
Australia
,
Japan
,
China
,
Southeast
Asia
,
India
,
Siberia
.
Hal
,
the
linguist
,
saw
the
glittering
discs
and
necklaces
in
terms
of
the
languages
spoken
therein
.
Australia
,
the
Philippine
Islands
,
Japan
,
and
northern
China
were
inhabited
by
those
members
of
the
Haijac
Union
that
spoke
American
.
Southern
China
,
all
of
southeast
Asia
,
southern
India
and
Ceylon
,
these
states
of
the
Malay
Federation
spoke
Bazaar
.
Siberia
spoke
Icelandic
.
His
mind
turned
the
globe
swiftly
for
him
,
and
he
visualized
Africa
,
which
used
Swahili
south
of
the
Sahara
Sea
.
All
around
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
Asia
Minor
,
northern
India
,
and
Tibet
,
Hebrew
was
the
native
tongue
.
In
southern
Europe
,
between
the
Israeli
Republics
and
the
Icelandic-speaking
peoples
of
northern
Europe
,
was
a
thin
but
long
stretch
of
territory
called
March
.
This
was
no
man's
land
,
disputed
by
the
Haijac
Union
and
the
Israeli
Republic
,
a
potential
source
of
war
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.
Neither
nation
would
give
up
their
claim
on
it
,
yet
neither
wished
to
make
any
move
that
might
lead
to
a
second
Apocalyptic
War
.
So
,
for
all
practical
purposes
,
it
was
an
independent
nation
and
by
now
had
its
own
organized
government
(
unrecognized
outside
its
own
borders
)
.
Its
citizens
spoke
all
of
the
world's
surviving
tongues
,
plus
a
new
one
called
Lingo
,
a
pidgin
whose
vocabulary
was
derived
from
the
other
six
and
whose
syntax
was
so
simple
it
could
be
contained
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
.
Hal
saw
in
his
mind
the
rest
of
Earth
:
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
the
Caribbean
Islands
,
and
the
eastern
half
of
South
America
.
Here
the
peoples
spoke
the
tongue
of
Iceland
because
that
island
had
gotten
the
jump
on
the
Hawaiian-Americans
who
were
busy
resettling
North
America
and
the
western
half
of
South
America
after
the
Apocalyptic
War
.
Then
there
was
North
America
,
where
American
was
the
native
speech
of
all
except
the
twenty
descendants
of
French-Canadians
living
on
the
Hudson
Bay
Preserve
.
Hal
knew
that
when
that
side
of
Earth
rotated
into
the
night
zone
,
Sigmen
City
would
blaze
out
into
space
.
And
,
somewhere
in
that
enormous
light
,
was
his
apartment
.
But
Mary
would
soon
no
longer
be
living
there
,
for
she
would
be
notified
in
a
few
days
that
her
husband
had
died
in
an
accident
while
on
a
flight
to
Tahiti
.
She
would
weep
in
private
,
he
was
sure
,
for
she
loved
him
in
her
frigid
way
,
though
in
public
she
would
be
dry-eyed
.
Her
friends
and
professional
associates
would
sympathize
with
her
,
not
because
she
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
,
but
because
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
who
thought
unrealistically
.
If
Hal
Yarrow
had
been
killed
in
a
crash
,
he
must
have
wanted
it
that
way
.
There
was
no
such
thing
as
an
``
accident
''
.
Somehow
,
all
the
other
passengers
(
also
supposed
to
have
died
in
this
web
of
elaborate
frauds
to
cover
up
the
disappearance
of
the
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
)
had
simultaneously
``
agreed
''
to
die
.
And
,
therefore
,
being
in
disgrace
,
they
would
not
be
cremated
and
their
ashes
flung
to
the
winds
in
public
ceremony
.
No
,
the
fish
could
eat
their
bodies
for
all
the
Sturch
cared
.
Hal
felt
sorry
for
Mary
;
;
he
had
a
time
keeping
the
tears
from
welling
to
his
own
eyes
as
he
stood
in
the
crowd
in
the
observation
dome
.
Yet
,
he
told
himself
,
this
was
the
best
way
.
He
and
Mary
would
no
longer
have
to
tear
and
rend
at
each
other
;
;
their
mutual
torture
would
be
over
.
Mary
was
free
to
marry
again
,
not
knowing
that
the
Sturch
had
secretly
given
her
a
divorce
,
thinking
that
death
had
dissolved
her
marriage
.
She
would
have
a
year
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
,
to
choose
a
mate
from
a
list
selected
by
her
gapt
.
Perhaps
,
the
psychological
barriers
that
had
prevented
her
from
conceiving
Hal's
child
would
no
longer
be
present
.
Perhaps
.
Hal
doubted
if
this
happy
event
would
occur
.
Mary
was
as
frozen
below
the
navel
as
he
.
No
matter
who
the
candidate
for
marriage
selected
by
the
gapt
The
gapt
.
Pornsen
.
He
would
no
longer
have
to
see
that
fat
face
,
hear
that
whining
voice
``
Hal
Yarrow
''
!
!
Said
the
whining
voice
.
And
,
slowly
,
feeling
himself
icy
yet
burning
,
Hal
turned
.
There
was
the
squat
loose-jowled
man
,
smiling
lopsidedly
up
at
him
.
``
My
beloved
ward
,
my
perennial
gadfly
''
,
said
the
whining
voice
.
``
I
had
no
idea
that
you
,
too
,
would
be
on
this
glorious
voyage
.
But
I
might
have
known
!
!
We
seem
to
be
bound
by
love
;
;
Sigmen
himself
must
have
foreseen
it
.
Love
to
you
,
my
ward
''
.
``
Sigmen
love
you
,
too
,
my
guardian
''
,
said
Hal
,
choking
.
``
How
wonderful
to
see
your
cherished
self
.
I
had
thought
we
would
never
again
speak
to
each
other
''
.
5
the
Gabriel
pointed
towards
her
destination
and
,
under
one-gee
acceleration
,
began
to
build
up
towards
her
ultimate
velocity
,
99.1
percent
of
the
speed
of
light
.
Meanwhile
,
all
the
personnel
except
those
few
needed
to
carry
out
the
performance
of
the
ship
,
went
into
the
suspensor
.
Here
they
would
lie
in
suspended
animation
for
many
years
.
Some
time
later
,
after
a
check
had
been
made
of
all
automatic
equipment
,
the
crew
would
join
the
others
.
They
would
sleep
while
the
Gabriel's
drive
would
increase
the
acceleration
to
a
point
which
the
unfrozen
bodies
of
the
personnel
could
not
have
endured
.
Upon
reaching
the
desired
speed
,
the
automatic
equipment
would
cut
off
the
drive
,
and
the
silent
but
not
empty
vessel
would
hurl
towards
the
star
which
was
its
journey's
end
.
Many
years
later
,
the
photon-counting
apparatus
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
would
determine
that
the
star
was
close
enough
to
actuate
deceleration
.
Again
,
a
force
too
strong
for
unfrozen
bodies
to
endure
would
be
applied
.
Then
,
after
slowing
the
vessel
considerably
,
the
drive
would
adjust
to
a
one-gee
deceleration
.
And
the
crew
would
be
automatically
brought
out
of
their
suspended
animation
.
These
members
would
then
unthaw
the
rest
of
the
personnel
.
And
,
in
the
half-year
left
before
reaching
their
destination
,
the
men
would
carry
out
whatever
preparations
were
needed
.
Hal
Yarrow
was
among
the
last
to
go
into
the
suspensor
and
among
the
first
to
come
out
.
He
had
to
study
the
recordings
of
the
language
of
the
chief
nation
of
Ozagen
,
Siddo
.
And
,
from
the
first
,
he
faced
a
difficult
task
.
The
expedition
that
had
discovered
Ozagen
had
succeeded
in
correlating
two
thousand
Siddo
words
with
an
equal
number
of
American
words
.
The
description
of
the
Siddo
syntax
was
very
restricted
.
And
,
as
Hal
found
out
,
obviously
mistaken
in
many
cases
.
This
discovery
caused
Hal
anxiety
.
His
duty
was
to
write
a
school
text
and
to
teach
the
entire
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
how
to
speak
Ozagen
.
Yet
,
if
he
used
all
of
the
little
means
at
his
disposal
,
he
would
be
instructing
his
students
wrongly
.
Moreover
,
even
getting
this
across
would
be
difficult
.
For
one
thing
,
the
organs
of
speech
of
the
Ozagen
natives
differed
somewhat
from
Earthmen's
;
;
the
sounds
made
by
these
organs
were
,
therefore
,
dissimilar
.
It
was
true
that
they
could
be
approximated
,
but
would
the
Ozagenians
understand
these
approximations
?
?
Another
obstacle
was
the
grammatical
construction
of
Siddo
.
Consider
the
tense
system
.
Instead
of
inflecting
a
verb
or
using
an
unattached
particle
to
indicate
the
past
or
future
,
Siddo
used
an
entirely
different
word
.
Thus
,
the
masculine
animate
infinitive
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai
,
meaning
to
live
,
was
,
in
the
perfect
tense
,
ksu'u'peli'afo
,
and
,
in
the
future
,
mai'teipa
.
The
same
use
of
an
entirely
different
word
applied
for
all
the
other
tenses
.
Plus
the
fact
that
Siddo
not
only
had
the
normal
(
to
Earthmen
)
three
genders
of
masculine
,
feminine
,
and
neuter
,
but
the
two
extra
of
inanimate
and
spiritual
.
Fortunately
,
gender
was
inflected
,
though
the
expression
of
it
would
be
difficult
for
anybody
not
born
in
Siddo
.
The
system
of
indicating
gender
varied
according
to
tense
.
All
the
other
parts
of
speech
:
nouns
,
pronouns
,
adjectives
,
adverbs
,
and
conjunctions
operated
under
the
same
system
as
the
verbs
.
This
was
not
,
for
the
Angel
,
just
a
matter
of
running
through
a
logical
or
deductive
chain
,
or
deciding
on
some
action
from
some
already
established
premise
.
No
doubt
the
Angels
could
do
that
kind
of
thing
as
fast
as
any
computer
.
What
Gabriel
was
being
asked
to
do
now
,
however
,
was
to
re-examine
all
his
basic
assumptions
,
make
value-judgments
on
them
,
and
give
them
new
and
different
powers
in
his
mind
to
govern
his
motives
.
This
is
not
wholly
a
reasoning
process
--
a
computer
cannot
do
it
all
--
and
even
in
an
Angel
it
takes
time
.
(
Or
,
perhaps
,
especially
in
an
Angel
,
whose
assumptions
had
mostly
been
fixed
millions
of
years
ago
.
)
Being
reasonably
sure
of
the
reason
for
the
long
pause
,
however
,
did
not
make
it
seem
any
less
long
to
Jack
.
He
had
already
become
used
to
Hesperus'
snapping
back
answers
to
questions
almost
before
Jack
could
get
them
asked
.
There
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
wait
.
The
dice
were
cast
.
At
last
Gabriel
spoke
.
``
We
misjudged
you
''
,
he
said
slowly
.
``
We
had
concluded
that
no
race
as
ephemeral
as
yours
could
have
had
time
to
develop
a
sense
of
justice
.
Of
course
we
have
before
us
the
example
of
the
great
races
at
the
galactic
center
;
;
individually
they
are
nearly
as
mortal
as
you
--
the
difference
does
not
seem
very
marked
to
us
,
where
it
exists
.
But
they
have
survived
for
long
periods
as
races
,
whereas
you
are
young
.
We
shall
recommend
to
them
that
they
shorten
your
trial
period
by
half
.
``
For
now
,
it
is
clear
that
we
were
in
the
wrong
.
You
may
reclaim
your
property
,
and
the
penalty
on
Hesperus
is
lifted
.
Hesperus
,
you
may
speak
''
.
``
I
did
not
perceive
this
essential
distinction
either
,
First-Born
''
,
Hesperus
said
at
once
,
``
I
was
only
practicing
a
concept
that
Jack
taught
me
,
called
a
deal
''
.
``
Nevertheless
,
you
were
its
agent
.
Jack
,
what
is
the
nature
of
this
concept
''
?
?
``
It's
a
kind
of
agreement
in
which
each
party
gives
something
to
the
other
''
,
Jack
said
.
``
We
regard
it
as
fair
only
when
each
party
feels
that
what
he
has
received
is
as
valuable
,
or
more
valuable
,
than
what
he
has
given
''
.
His
heart
,
he
discovered
,
was
pounding
.
``
For
instance
,
Hesperus
agreed
to
help
me
find
my
property
,
and
I
agreed
to
take
him
to
Earth
.
Between
individuals
,
this
process
is
called
bargaining
.
When
it
is
done
between
races
or
nations
,
it
is
called
making
a
treaty
.
And
the
major
part
of
my
mission
to
your
nest
is
to
make
a
treaty
between
your
race
and
mine
.
Recovering
the
property
was
much
less
important
''
.
``
Strange
''
,
Gabriel
said
.
``
And
apparently
impossible
.
Though
it
might
be
that
we
would
have
much
to
give
you
,
you
have
nothing
to
give
us
''
.
``
Hesperus
and
Lucifer
''
,
Jack
said
,
``
show
that
we
do
''
.
Another
pause
;
;
but
this
one
was
not
nearly
as
long
.
``
Then
it
is
a
matter
of
pleasure
;
;
of
curiosity
;
;
of
a
more
alive
time
.
Yes
,
those
could
be
commodities
under
this
concept
.
But
you
should
understand
,
Jack
,
that
Hesperus
and
Lucifer
are
not
long
out
of
the
nursery
.
Visiting
the
Earth
would
not
be
an
offering
of
worth
to
those
of
us
who
are
older
''
.
This
explained
a
great
deal
.
``
All
the
more
reason
,
then
''
,
Jack
said
,
``
why
we
must
have
a
treaty
.
We
will
gladly
entertain
your
young
and
give
them
proper
living
quarters
,
in
return
for
their
help
in
running
our
fusion
reactors
.
But
we
must
know
if
this
is
in
accordance
with
your
customs
,
and
must
have
your
agreement
they
will
not
misuse
the
power
we
put
in
their
hands
,
to
our
hurt
''
.
``
But
this
simply
requires
that
they
behave
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
their
own
natures
,
and
respect
yours
in
turn
.
To
this
we
of
course
agree
''
.
Jack
felt
a
wave
of
complete
elation
,
but
in
a
second
it
had
vanished
without
a
trace
.
What
Gabriel
was
asking
was
that
mankind
forego
all
its
parochial
moral
judgments
,
and
contract
to
let
the
Angels
serve
on
Earth
as
it
is
in
Heaven
regardless
of
the
applicable
Earth
laws
.
The
Angels
in
turn
would
exercise
similar
restraints
in
respect
for
the
natural
preferences
and
natures
of
the
Earthmen
--
but
they
had
no
faintest
notion
of
man's
perverse
habit
of
passing
and
enforcing
laws
which
were
contrary
to
his
own
preferences
and
violations
of
his
nature
.
The
simple
treaty
principle
that
Gabriel
was
asking
him
to
ratify
,
in
short
,
was
nothing
less
than
total
trust
.
Nothing
less
would
serve
.
And
it
might
be
,
considering
the
uncomfortable
custom
the
Angels
had
of
thinking
of
everything
in
terms
of
absolutes
,
that
the
proposal
of
anything
less
might
well
amount
instead
to
something
like
a
declaration
of
war
.
Furthermore
,
even
the
highly
trained
law
clerk
who
was
a
part
of
Jack's
total
make-up
could
not
understand
how
the
principle
could
ever
be
codified
.
Almost
the
whole
experience
of
mankind
pointed
toward
suspicion
,
not
trust
,
as
the
safest
and
sanest
attitude
toward
all
outsiders
.
Yet
there
was
some
precedent
for
it
.
The
history
of
disarmament
agreements
,
for
instance
,
had
been
unreassuringly
dismal
;
;
but
the
United
States
and
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
nevertheless
did
eventually
agree
on
an
atomic
bomb
test
ban
,
and
a
sort
of
provisional
acceptance
of
each
other's
good
intentions
on
this
limited
question
.
Out
of
that
agreement
,
though
not
by
any
easy
road
,
eventually
emerged
the
present
world
hegemony
of
the
United
Nations
;
;
suspicion
between
member
states
still
existed
,
but
it
was
of
about
the
same
low
order
of
virulence
as
the
twentieth-century
rivalry
between
Arizona
and
California
over
water
supplies
.
Besides
,
agreements
``
in
principle
''
,
with
the
petty
details
to
be
thrashed
out
later
,
were
commonplace
in
diplomatic
history
.
The
trouble
with
them
was
that
they
almost
never
worked
,
and
in
fact
an
agreement
``
in
principle
''
historically
turned
out
to
be
a
sure
sign
that
neither
party
really
wanted
the
quarrel
settled
.
Suppose
that
this
one
were
to
work
?
?
There
was
no
question
in
Jack's
mind
of
the
good
faith
on
one
side
,
at
least
.
If
mankind
could
be
convinced
of
that
It
was
worth
trying
.
In
fact
,
it
had
to
be
tried
.
It
would
be
at
once
the
most
tentative
and
most
final
treaty
that
Earth
had
ever
signed
.
Secretary
Hart
had
taught
Jack
,
at
least
partially
,
to
be
content
with
small
beginnings
in
all
diplomatic
matters
;
;
but
there
was
no
small
way
to
handle
this
one
.
He
turned
back
to
the
screens
,
the
crucial
,
conclusive
phrase
on
his
lips
.
But
he
was
too
late
.
He
had
lost
his
audience
.
For
a
moment
he
could
make
no
sense
at
all
of
what
he
saw
.
It
seemed
to
be
only
a
riot
of
color
,
light
and
meaningless
activity
.
Gradually
,
he
realized
that
the
pentagon
of
Angel
elders
had
vanished
,
and
that
the
ritual
learning
dance
of
the
nursery
had
been
broken
up
.
The
Angels
in
the
nursery
were
zigzagging
wildly
in
all
directions
,
seemingly
at
random
.
``
Hesperus
!
!
What's
going
on
here
?
?
What's
happened
''
?
?
``
Your
brothers
have
been
found
.
They
are
on
their
way
here
''
.
``
Where
?
?
I
don't
see
them
.
The
instruments
don't
show
them
''
.
``
You
can't
see
them
yet
,
Jack
.
They'll
be
in
range
in
a
short
while
''
.
Jack
scanned
the
skies
,
the
boards
,
and
the
skies
again
.
Nothing
.
No
--
there
was
a
tiny
pip
on
the
radar
;
;
and
it
was
getting
bigger
rapidly
.
If
that
was
the
skiff
,
it
was
making
unprecedented
speed
.
Then
the
skiff
hove
into
sight
,
just
a
dot
of
light
at
first
against
the
roiling
blackness
and
crimson
streaks
of
the
Coal
Sack
.
Through
the
telescope
,
Jack
could
see
that
both
spacesuits
were
still
attached
to
it
.
The
sail
was
still
unfurled
,
though
there
were
a
good
many
holes
in
it
,
as
Langer
had
predicted
would
be
the
case
by
now
.
It
was
a
startling
,
almost
numenous
sight
;
;
but
even
more
awesome
was
the
fact
that
it
was
trailing
an
enormous
comet's-tail
of
Angels
.
The
skiff
was
not
heading
for
the
nursery
,
however
.
It
seemed
unlikely
that
her
crew
,
if
either
of
them
were
alive
,
could
even
see
the
Ariadne
,
for
they
were
passing
her
at
a
distance
of
nearly
a
light-year
.
And
there
would
be
no
chance
of
signaling
them
--
without
the
Nernst
generator
Jack
could
not
send
a
call
powerful
enough
to
get
through
all
the
static
,
and
by
the
time
he
could
rebuild
his
fusion
power
the
skiff
would
be
gone
.
Fuming
,
helpless
,
he
watched
them
pass
him
.
The
sail
,
ragged
though
it
was
,
still
had
enough
surface
to
catch
some
of
the
ocean
of
power
being
poured
out
from
the
nursery
stars
.
He
would
never
have
believed
,
without
seeing
it
,
that
the
bizarre
little
vessel
could
go
so
fast
.
But
where
was
it
going
?
?
And
why
was
it
causing
so
much
agitation
among
the
Angels
,
and
being
followed
by
so
many
of
them
?
?
There
was
only
one
possible
answer
,
but
Jack's
horrified
mind
refused
to
believe
it
until
he
had
fed
the
radar
plots
of
the
skiff's
course
into
the
computer
.
The
curve
on
the
card
the
computer
spat
back
at
him
couldn't
be
argued
with
,
however
.
The
skiff
was
headed
for
the
very
center
of
the
nebula
--
toward
that
place
which
,
Jack
knew
now
,
could
hold
nothing
less
important
than
the
very
core
of
the
Angel's
life
and
religion
.
It
was
clear
that
Langer
had
at
last
found
a
way
to
attract
the
Angel's
attention
.
It
was
equally
clear
that
as
of
this
moment
,
the
treaty
was
off
.
Stern
chase
10
Langer
would
have
to
be
headed
off
,
whether
he
knew
where
he
was
going
or
not
.
Almost
surely
he
did
;
;
after
all
,
he
had
had
the
same
set
of
facts
as
Jack
had
had
to
work
from
,
and
he
was
an
almost
frighteningly
observant
man
.
But
not
having
talked
to
the
Angels
,
he
had
made
a
wrong
turn
in
his
reasoning
somewhere
along
the
line
.
Had
he
decided
,
perhaps
,
that
the
center
of
the
cloud
was
a
center
of
government
,
instead
of
a
center
of
life
and
faith
''
?
?
But
it
didn't
matter
now
whether
he
meant
to
invade
the
Holy
of
Holies
,
or
was
simply
headed
in
that
direction
by
accident
.
If
it
was
intentional
,
it
was
now
also
unnecessary
;
;
and
whether
intentional
or
not
,
the
outcome
would
be
disastrous
.
Jack
crawled
under
the
boards
and
restored
the
six
feet
of
lead
line
he
had
excised
from
the
Nernst
generator
switch
.
When
he
was
back
on
his
feet
again
and
about
to
reinstall
the
fuses
,
however
,
he
hesitated
.
He
had
to
have
fusion
power
to
catch
up
with
the
skiff
,
and
he
had
to
have
it
fast
.
But
fusion
power
in
the
Coal
Sack
was
what
had
triggered
all
the
trouble
in
the
first
place
--
and
he
already
had
an
Angel
aboard
.
``
Hesperus
''
?
?
``
Receiving
''
.
``
I'm
going
to
turn
my
generator
back
on
,
as
I
promised
to
do
.
But
I
can't
take
you
to
Earth
yet
.
First
I've
got
to
intercept
my
brothers
before
they
get
any
deeper
into
trouble
.
Will
you
obstruct
this
,
or
will
you
help
?
?
I
know
it's
not
part
of
the
bargain
,
and
your
elders
might
not
like
it
''
.
``
Nobody
else
can
live
in
your
hearth
while
I
am
in
it
''
,
Hesperus
said
promptly
.
``
As
for
my
elders
,
they
have
already
admitted
that
they
were
wrong
.
If
because
of
this
incident
they
become
angry
with
Earth
,
I
will
not
be
permitted
to
go
there
at
all
.
Therefore
of
course
I
will
help
''
.
With
a
short-lived
sigh
of
relief
,
Jack
plugged
the
fuses
back
in
and
threw
the
switch
.
Without
an
instant's
transition
,
the
green
light
that
meant
full
fusion
power
winked
on
the
board
.
Always
before
,
it
had
taken
five
minutes
to
--
Of
course
.
Hesperus
was
in
there
.
From
here
on
out
,
the
Ariadne
was
going
to
be
hotter
than
any
space
cruiser
man
had
ever
dreamed
of
.
But
since
he
had
failed
to
anticipate
it
,
he
lost
the
five
minutes
anyhow
,
in
plotting
an
intercept
orbit
.
``
Hesperus
,
don't
use
this
t-tau
vector
trick
of
yours
,
please
.
Ryan
hefted
his
bulk
up
and
supported
it
on
one
elbow
.
He
rubbed
his
eyes
sleepily
with
one
huge
paw
.
``
Ekstrohm
,
Nogol
,
you
guys
okay
''
?
?
``
Nothing
wrong
with
me
that
couldn't
be
cured
''
,
Nogol
said
.
He
didn't
say
what
would
cure
him
;
;
he
had
been
explaining
all
during
the
trip
what
he
needed
to
make
him
feel
like
himself
.
His
small
black
eyes
darted
inside
the
olive
oval
of
his
face
.
``
Ekstrohm
''
?
?
Ryan
insisted
.
``
Okay
''
.
``
Well
,
let's
take
a
ground-level
look
at
the
country
around
here
''
.
The
facsiport
rolled
open
on
the
landscape
.
A
range
of
bluffs
hugged
the
horizon
,
the
color
of
decaying
moss
.
Above
them
,
the
sky
was
the
black
of
space
,
or
the
almost
equal
black
of
the
winter
sky
above
Minneapolis
,
seen
against
neon-lit
snow
.
That
cold
,
empty
sky
was
full
of
fire
and
light
.
It
seemed
almost
a
magnification
of
the
Galaxy
itself
,
of
the
Milky
Way
,
blown
up
by
some
master
photographer
.
This
fiery
swath
was
actually
only
a
belt
of
minor
planets
,
almost
like
the
asteroid
belt
in
the
original
Solar
System
.
These
planets
were
much
bigger
,
nearly
all
capable
of
holding
an
atmosphere
.
But
to
the
infuriation
of
scientists
,
for
no
known
reason
not
all
of
them
did
.
This
would
be
the
fifth
mapping
expedition
to
the
planetoids
of
Yancy-6
in
three
generations
.
They
lay
months
away
from
the
nearest
Earth
star
by
jump
drive
,
and
no
one
knew
what
they
were
good
for
,
although
it
was
felt
that
they
would
probably
be
good
for
something
if
it
could
only
be
discovered
--
much
like
the
continent
of
Antarctica
in
ancient
history
.
``
How
can
a
planet
with
so
many
neighbors
be
so
lonely
''
?
?
Ryan
asked
.
He
was
the
captain
,
so
he
could
ask
questions
like
that
.
``
Some
can
be
lonely
in
a
crowd
''
,
Nogol
said
elaborately
.
``
What
will
we
need
outside
,
Ryan
''
?
?
Ekstrohm
asked
.
``
No
helmets
''
,
the
captain
answered
.
``
We
can
breathe
out
there
,
all
right
.
It
just
won't
be
easy
.
This
old
world
lost
all
of
its
helium
and
trace
gases
long
ago
.
Nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
about
it
''
.
``
Ryan
,
look
over
there
''
,
Nogol
said
.
``
Animals
.
Ringing
the
ship
.
Think
they're
intelligent
,
maybe
hostile
''
?
?
``
I
think
they're
dead
''
,
Ekstrohm
interjected
quietly
.
``
I
get
no
readings
from
them
at
all
.
Sonic
,
electronic
,
galvanic
--
all
blank
.
According
to
these
needles
,
they're
stone
dead
''
.
``
Ekstrohm
,
you
and
I
will
have
a
look
''
,
Ryan
said
.
``
You
hold
down
the
fort
,
Nogol
.
Take
it
easy
''
.
``
Easy
''
,
Nogol
confirmed
.
``
I
heard
a
story
once
about
a
rookie
who
got
excited
when
the
captain
stepped
outside
and
he
couldn't
get
an
encephalographic
reading
on
him
.
Me
,
I
know
the
mind
of
an
officer
works
in
a
strange
and
unfathomable
manner
''
.
``
I'm
not
worried
about
you
mis-reading
the
dials
,
Nogol
,
just
about
a
lug
like
you
reading
them
at
all
.
Remember
,
when
the
little
hand
is
straight
up
that's
negative
.
Positive
results
start
when
it
goes
towards
the
hand
you
use
to
make
your
mark
''
.
``
But
I'm
ambidextrous
''
.
Ryan
told
him
what
he
could
do
then
.
Ekstrohm
smiled
,
and
followed
the
captain
through
the
airlock
with
only
a
glance
at
the
lapel
gauge
on
his
coverall
.
The
strong
negative
field
his
suit
set
up
would
help
to
repel
bacteria
and
insects
.
Actually
,
the
types
of
infection
that
could
attack
a
warm-blooded
mammal
were
not
infinite
,
and
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
hundred
years
adequate
defenses
had
been
found
for
all
basic
categories
.
He
wasn't
likely
to
come
down
with
hot
chills
and
puzzling
striped
fever
.
They
ignored
the
ladder
down
to
the
planet
surface
and
,
with
only
a
glance
at
the
seismological
gauge
to
judge
surface
resistance
,
dropped
to
the
ground
.
It
was
day
,
but
in
the
thin
atmosphere
contrasts
were
sharp
between
light
and
shadow
.
They
walked
from
midnight
to
noon
,
noon
to
midnight
,
and
came
to
the
beast
sprawled
on
its
side
.
Ekstrohm
nudged
it
with
a
boot
.
``
Hey
,
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
wart-hog
''
.
``
Uh-huh
''
,
Ryan
admitted
.
``
One
of
the
best
matches
I've
ever
found
.
Well
,
it
has
to
happen
.
Statistical
average
and
all
.
Still
,
it
sometimes
gives
you
a
creepy
feeling
to
find
a
rabbit
or
a
snapping
turtle
on
some
strange
world
.
It
makes
you
wonder
if
this
exploration
business
isn't
all
some
big
joke
,
and
somebody
has
been
everywhere
before
you
even
started
''
.
The
surveyor
looked
sidewise
at
the
captain
.
The
big
man
seldom
gave
out
with
such
thoughts
.
Ekstrohm
cleared
his
throat
.
``
What
shall
we
do
with
this
one
?
?
Dissect
it
''
?
?
Ryan
nudged
it
with
his
toe
,
following
Ekstrohm's
example
.
``
I
don't
know
,
Stormy
.
It
sure
as
hell
doesn't
look
like
any
dominant
intelligent
species
to
me
.
No
hands
,
for
one
thing
.
Of
course
,
that's
not
definite
proof
''
.
``
No
,
it
isn't
''
,
Ekstrohm
said
.
``
I
think
we'd
better
let
it
lay
until
we
get
a
clearer
picture
of
the
ecological
setup
around
here
.
In
the
meantime
,
we
might
be
thinking
on
the
problem
all
these
dead
beasts
represent
.
What
killed
them
''
?
?
``
It
looks
like
we
did
,
when
we
made
blastdown
''
.
``
But
what
about
our
landing
was
lethal
to
the
creatures
''
?
?
``
Radiation
''
?
?
Ekstrohm
suggested
.
``
The
planet
is
very
low
in
radiation
from
mineral
deposits
,
and
the
atmosphere
seems
to
shield
out
most
of
the
solar
output
.
Any
little
dose
of
radiation
might
knock
off
these
critters
''
.
``
I
don't
know
about
that
.
Maybe
it
would
work
the
other
way
.
Maybe
because
they
have
had
virtually
no
radioactive
exposure
and
don't
have
any
R's
stored
up
,
they
could
take
a
lot
without
harm
''
.
``
Then
maybe
it
was
the
shockwave
we
set
up
.
Or
maybe
it's
sheer
xenophobia
.
They
curl
up
and
die
at
the
sight
of
something
strange
and
alien
--
like
a
spaceship
''
.
``
Maybe
''
,
the
captain
admitted
.
``
At
this
stage
of
the
game
anything
could
be
possible
.
But
there's
one
possibility
I
particularly
don't
like
''
.
``
And
that
is
''
?
?
``
Suppose
it
was
not
us
that
killed
these
aliens
.
Suppose
it
is
something
right
on
the
planet
,
native
to
it
.
I
just
hope
it
doesn't
work
on
Earthmen
too
.
These
critters
went
real
sudden
''
.
Ekstrohm
lay
in
his
bunk
and
thought
,
the
camp
is
quiet
.
The
Earthmen
made
camp
outside
the
spaceship
.
There
was
no
reason
to
leave
the
comfortable
quarters
inside
the
ship
,
except
that
,
faced
with
a
possibility
of
sleeping
on
solid
ground
,
they
simply
had
to
get
out
.
The
camp
was
a
cluster
of
aluminum
bubbles
,
ringed
with
a
spy
web
to
alert
the
Earthmen
to
the
approach
of
any
being
.
Each
man
had
a
bubble
to
himself
,
privacy
after
the
long
period
of
enforced
intimacy
on
board
the
ship
.
Ekstrohm
lay
in
his
bunk
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
night
on
Yancey-6
138
.
There
was
a
keening
of
wind
,
and
a
cracking
of
the
frozen
ground
.
Insects
there
were
on
the
world
,
but
they
were
frozen
solid
during
the
night
,
only
to
revive
and
thaw
in
the
morning
sun
.
The
bunk
he
lay
on
was
much
more
uncomfortable
than
the
acceleration
couches
on
board
.
Yet
he
knew
the
others
were
sleeping
more
soundly
,
now
that
they
had
renewed
their
contact
with
the
matter
that
had
birthed
them
to
send
them
riding
high
vacuum
.
Ekstrohm
was
not
asleep
.
Now
there
could
be
an
end
to
pretending
.
He
threw
off
the
light
blanket
and
swung
his
feet
off
the
bunk
,
to
the
floor
.
Ekstrohm
stood
up
.
There
was
no
longer
any
need
to
hide
.
But
what
was
there
to
do
?
?
What
had
changed
for
him
?
?
He
no
longer
had
to
lie
in
his
bunk
all
night
,
his
eyes
closed
,
pretending
to
sleep
.
In
privacy
he
could
walk
around
,
leave
the
light
on
,
read
.
It
was
small
comfort
for
insomnia
.
Ekstrohm
never
slept
.
Some
doctors
had
informed
him
he
was
mistaken
about
this
.
Actually
,
they
said
,
he
did
sleep
,
but
so
shortly
and
fitfully
that
he
forgot
.
Others
admitted
he
was
absolutely
correct
--
he
never
slept
.
His
body
processes
only
slowed
down
enough
for
him
to
dispell
fatigue
poisons
.
Occasionally
he
fell
into
a
waking
,
gritty-eyed
stupor
;
;
but
he
never
slept
.
Never
at
all
.
Naturally
,
he
couldn't
let
his
shipmates
know
this
.
Insomnia
would
ground
him
from
the
Exploration
Service
,
on
physiological
if
not
psychological
grounds
.
He
had
to
hide
it
.
Over
the
years
,
he
had
had
buddies
in
space
in
whom
he
thought
he
could
confide
.
The
buddies
invariably
took
advantage
of
him
.
Since
he
couldn't
sleep
anyway
,
he
might
as
well
stand
their
watches
for
them
or
write
their
reports
.
Where
the
hell
did
he
get
off
threatening
to
report
any
laxness
on
their
part
to
the
captain
?
?
A
man
with
insomnia
had
better
avoid
bad
dreams
of
that
kind
if
he
knew
what
was
good
for
him
.
Ekstrohm
had
to
hide
his
secret
.
In
a
camp
,
instead
of
shipboard
,
hiding
the
secret
was
easier
.
But
the
secret
itself
was
just
as
hard
.
Ekstrohm
picked
up
a
lightweight
no-back
from
the
ship's
library
,
a
book
by
Bloch
,
the
famous
twentieth
century
expert
on
sex
.
He
scanned
a
few
lines
on
the
social
repercussions
of
a
celebrated
nineteenth
century
sex
murderer
,
but
he
couldn't
seem
to
concentrate
on
the
weighty
,
pontifical
,
ponderous
style
.
On
impulse
,
he
flipped
up
the
heat
control
on
his
coverall
and
slid
back
the
hatch
of
the
bubble
.
Ekstrohm
walked
through
the
alien
glass
and
looked
up
at
the
unfamiliar
constellations
,
smelling
the
frozen
sterility
of
the
thin
air
.
Behind
him
,
his
mates
stirred
without
waking
.
Ekstrohm
was
startled
in
the
morning
by
a
banging
on
the
hatch
of
his
bubble
.
It
took
him
a
few
seconds
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
,
and
then
he
got
up
from
the
bunk
where
he
had
been
resting
,
sleeplessly
.
The
angry
burnt-red
face
of
Ryan
greeted
him
.
``
Okay
,
Stormy
,
this
isn't
the
place
for
fun
and
games
.
What
did
you
do
with
them
''
?
?
``
Do
with
what
''
?
?
``
The
dead
beasties
.
All
the
dead
animals
laying
around
the
ship
''
.
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Ryan
?
?
What
do
you
think
I
did
with
them
''
?
?
``
I
don't
know
.
All
I
know
is
that
they
are
gone
''
.
``
Gone
''
?
?
Ekstrohm
shouldered
his
way
outside
and
scanned
the
veldt
.
There
was
no
ring
of
animal
corpses
.
Nothing
.
Nothing
but
wispy
grass
whipping
in
the
keen
breeze
.
``
I'll
be
damned
''
,
Ekstrohm
said
.
``
You
are
right
now
,
buddy
.
ExPe
doesn't
like
anybody
mucking
up
primary
evidence
''
.
``
Where
do
you
get
off
,
Ryan
''
?
?
Ekstrohm
demanded
.
``
Why
pick
me
for
your
patsy
?
?
This
has
got
to
be
some
kind
of
local
phenomenon
.
Why
accuse
a
shipmate
of
being
behind
this
''
?
?
``
Listen
,
Ekstrohm
,
I
want
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
.
But
you
aren't
exactly
the
model
of
a
surveyor
,
you
know
.
You've
been
riding
on
a
pink
ticket
for
six
years
,
you
know
that
''
.
``
No
''
,
Ekstrohm
said
,
``
No
,
I
didn't
know
that
''
.
``
You've
been
hiding
things
from
me
and
Nogol
every
jump
we've
made
with
you
.
Now
comes
this
!
!
It
fits
the
pattern
of
secrecy
and
stealth
you've
been
involved
in
''
.
``
What
could
I
do
with
your
lousy
dead
bodies
?
?
What
would
I
want
with
them
''
?
?
``
All
I
know
is
that
you
were
outside
the
bubbles
last
night
,
and
you
were
the
only
sentient
being
who
came
in
or
out
of
our
alarm
web
.
The
tapes
show
that
.
Now
all
the
bodies
are
missing
,
like
they
got
up
and
walked
away
''
.
It
was
not
a
new
experience
to
Ekstrohm
.
No
.
Suspicion
wasn't
new
to
him
at
all
.
``
Ryan
,
there
are
other
explanations
for
the
disappearance
of
the
bodies
.
Look
for
them
,
will
you
?
?
I
give
you
my
word
I'm
not
trying
to
pull
some
stupid
kind
of
joke
,
or
to
deliberately
foul
up
the
expedition
.
Take
my
word
,
can't
you
''
?
?
Ryan
shook
his
head
.
``
I
don't
think
I
can
.
There's
still
such
a
thing
as
mental
illness
.
You
may
not
be
responsible
''
.
Ekstrohm
scowled
.
``
Don't
try
anything
violent
,
Stormy
.
I
outweigh
you
fifty
pounds
and
I'm
fast
for
a
big
man
''
.
``
I
wasn't
planning
on
jumping
you
.
Why
do
you
have
to
jump
me
the
first
time
something
goes
wrong
?
?
She
lived
and
was
given
a
name
.
Helva
.
For
her
first
three
vegetable
months
she
waved
her
crabbed
claws
,
kicked
weakly
with
her
clubbed
feet
and
enjoyed
the
usual
routine
of
the
infant
.
She
was
not
alone
for
there
were
three
other
such
children
in
the
big
city's
special
nursery
.
Soon
they
all
were
removed
to
Central
Laboratory
School
where
their
delicate
transformation
began
.
One
of
the
babies
died
in
the
initial
transferral
but
of
Helva's
``
class
''
,
seventeen
thrived
in
the
metal
shells
.
Instead
of
kicking
feet
,
Helva's
neural
responses
started
her
wheels
;
;
instead
of
grabbing
with
hands
,
she
manipulated
mechanical
extensions
.
As
she
matured
,
more
and
more
neural
synapses
would
be
adjusted
to
operate
other
mechanisms
that
went
into
the
maintenance
and
running
of
a
space
ship
.
For
Helva
was
destined
to
be
the
``
brain
''
half
of
a
scout
ship
,
partnered
with
a
man
or
a
woman
,
whichever
she
chose
,
as
the
mobile
half
.
She
would
be
among
the
elite
of
her
kind
.
Her
initial
intelligence
tests
registered
above
normal
and
her
adaptation
index
was
unusually
high
.
As
long
as
her
development
within
her
shell
lived
up
to
expectations
,
and
there
were
no
side-effects
from
the
pituitary
tinkering
,
Helva
would
live
a
rewarding
,
rich
and
unusual
life
,
a
far
cry
from
what
she
would
have
faced
as
an
ordinary
,
``
normal
''
being
.
However
,
no
diagram
of
her
brain
patterns
,
no
early
I.Q.
tests
recorded
certain
essential
facts
about
Helva
that
Central
must
eventually
learn
.
They
would
have
to
bide
their
official
time
and
see
,
trusting
that
the
massive
doses
of
shell-psychology
would
suffice
her
,
too
,
as
the
necessary
bulwark
against
her
unusual
confinement
and
the
pressures
of
her
profession
.
A
ship
run
by
a
human
brain
could
not
run
rogue
or
insane
with
the
power
and
resources
Central
had
to
build
into
their
scout
ships
.
Brain
ships
were
,
of
course
,
long
past
the
experimental
stages
.
Most
babes
survived
the
techniques
of
pituitary
manipulation
that
kept
their
bodies
small
,
eliminating
the
necessity
of
transfers
from
smaller
to
larger
shells
.
And
very
,
very
few
were
lost
when
the
final
connection
was
made
to
the
control
panels
of
ship
or
industrial
combine
.
Shell
people
resembled
mature
dwarfs
in
size
whatever
their
natal
deformities
were
,
but
the
well-oriented
brain
would
not
have
changed
places
with
the
most
perfect
body
in
the
Universe
.
So
,
for
happy
years
,
Helva
scooted
around
in
her
shell
with
her
classmates
,
playing
such
games
as
Stall
,
Power-Seek
,
studying
her
lessons
in
trajectory
,
propulsion
techniques
,
computation
,
logistics
,
mental
hygiene
,
basic
alien
psychology
,
philology
,
space
history
,
law
,
traffic
,
codes
:
all
the
et
ceteras
that
eventually
became
compounded
into
a
reasoning
,
logical
,
informed
citizen
.
Not
so
obvious
to
her
,
but
of
more
importance
to
her
teachers
,
Helva
ingested
the
precepts
of
her
conditioning
as
easily
as
she
absorbed
her
nutrient
fluid
.
She
would
one
day
be
grateful
to
the
patient
drone
of
the
sub-conscious-level
instruction
.
Helva's
civilization
was
not
without
busy
,
do-good
associations
,
exploring
possible
inhumanities
to
terrestrial
as
well
as
extraterrestrial
citizens
.
One
such
group
got
all
incensed
over
shelled
``
children
''
when
Helva
was
just
turning
fourteen
.
When
they
were
forced
to
,
Central
Worlds
shrugged
its
shoulders
,
arranged
a
tour
of
the
Laboratory
Schools
and
set
the
tour
off
to
a
big
start
by
showing
the
members
case
histories
,
complete
with
photographs
.
Very
few
committees
ever
looked
past
the
first
few
photos
.
Most
of
their
original
objections
about
``
shells
''
were
overridden
by
the
relief
that
these
hideous
(
to
them
)
bodies
were
mercifully
concealed
.
Helva's
class
was
doing
Fine
Arts
,
a
selective
subject
in
her
crowded
program
.
She
had
activated
one
of
her
microscopic
tools
which
she
would
later
use
for
minute
repairs
to
various
parts
of
her
control
panel
.
Her
subject
was
large
--
a
copy
of
the
Last
Supper
--
and
her
canvas
,
small
--
the
head
of
a
tiny
screw
.
She
had
tuned
her
sight
to
the
proper
degree
.
As
she
worked
she
absentmindedly
crooned
,
producing
a
curious
sound
.
Shell
people
used
their
own
vocal
cords
and
diaphragms
but
sound
issued
through
microphones
rather
than
mouths
.
Helva's
hum
then
had
a
curious
vibrancy
,
a
warm
,
dulcet
quality
even
in
its
aimless
chromatic
wanderings
.
``
Why
,
what
a
lovely
voice
you
have
''
,
said
one
of
the
female
visitors
.
Helva
``
looked
''
up
and
caught
a
fascinating
panorama
of
regular
,
dirty
craters
on
a
flaky
pink
surface
.
Her
hum
became
a
gurgle
of
surprise
.
She
instinctively
regulated
her
``
sight
''
until
the
skin
lost
its
cratered
look
and
the
pores
assumed
normal
proportions
.
``
Yes
,
we
have
quite
a
few
years
of
voice
training
,
madam
''
,
remarked
Helva
calmly
.
``
Vocal
peculiarities
often
become
excessively
irritating
during
prolonged
intra-stellar
distances
and
must
be
eliminated
.
I
enjoyed
my
lessons
''
.
Although
this
was
the
first
time
that
Helva
had
seen
unshelled
people
,
she
took
this
experience
calmly
.
Any
other
reaction
would
have
been
reported
instantly
.
``
I
meant
that
you
have
a
nice
singing
voice
dear
''
,
the
lady
amended
.
``
Thank
you
.
Would
you
like
to
see
my
work
''
?
?
Helva
asked
,
politely
.
She
instinctively
sheered
away
from
personal
discussions
but
she
filed
the
comment
away
for
further
meditation
.
``
Work
''
?
?
Asked
the
lady
.
``
I
am
currently
reproducing
the
Last
Supper
on
the
head
of
a
screw
''
.
``
No
,
I
say
''
,
the
lady
twittered
.
Helva
turned
her
vision
back
to
magnification
and
surveyed
her
copy
critically
.
``
Of
course
,
some
of
my
color
values
do
not
match
the
old
Master's
and
the
perspective
is
faulty
but
I
believe
it
to
be
a
fair
copy
''
.
The
lady's
eyes
,
unmagnified
,
bugged
out
.
``
Oh
,
I
forget
''
,
and
Helva's
voice
was
really
contrite
.
If
she
could
have
blushed
,
she
would
have
.
``
You
people
don't
have
adjustable
vision
''
.
The
monitor
of
this
discourse
grinned
with
pride
and
amusement
as
Helva's
tone
indicated
pity
for
the
unfortunate
.
``
Here
,
this
will
help
''
,
suggested
Helva
,
substituting
a
magnifying
device
in
one
extension
and
holding
it
over
the
picture
.
In
a
kind
of
shock
,
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
committee
bent
to
observe
the
incredibly
copied
and
brilliantly
executed
Last
Supper
on
the
head
of
a
screw
.
``
Well
''
,
remarked
one
gentleman
who
had
been
forced
to
accompany
his
wife
,
``
the
good
Lord
can
eat
where
angels
fear
to
tread
''
.
``
Are
you
referring
,
sir
''
,
asked
Helva
politely
,
``
to
the
Dark
Age
discussions
of
the
number
of
angels
who
could
stand
on
the
head
of
a
pin
''
?
?
``
I
had
that
in
mind
''
.
``
If
you
substitute
'
atom
'
for
'
angel
'
,
the
problem
is
not
insoluble
,
given
the
metallic
content
of
the
pin
in
question
''
.
``
Which
you
are
programed
to
compute
''
?
?
``
Of
course
''
.
``
Did
they
remember
to
program
a
sense
of
humor
,
as
well
,
young
lady
''
?
?
``
We
are
directed
to
develop
a
sense
of
proportion
,
sir
,
which
contributes
the
same
effect
''
.
The
good
man
chortled
appreciatively
and
decided
the
trip
was
worth
his
time
.
If
the
investigation
committee
spent
months
digesting
the
thoughtful
food
served
them
at
the
Laboratory
School
,
they
left
Helva
with
a
morsel
as
well
.
``
Singing
''
as
applicable
to
herself
required
research
.
She
had
,
of
course
,
been
exposed
to
and
enjoyed
a
music
appreciation
course
which
had
included
the
better
known
classical
works
such
as
``
Tristan
und
Isolde
''
,
``
Candide
''
,
``
Oklahoma
''
,
``
Nozze
de
Figaro
''
,
the
atomic
age
singers
,
Eileen
Farrell
,
Elvis
Presley
and
Geraldine
Todd
,
as
well
as
the
curious
rhythmic
progressions
of
the
Venusians
,
Capellan
visual
chromatics
and
the
sonic
concerti
of
the
Altairians
.
But
``
singing
''
for
any
shell
person
posed
considerable
technical
difficulties
to
be
overcome
.
Shell
people
were
schooled
to
examine
every
aspect
of
a
problem
or
situation
before
making
a
prognosis
.
Balanced
properly
between
optimism
and
practicality
,
the
nondefeatist
attitude
of
the
shell
people
led
them
to
extricate
themselves
,
their
ships
and
personnel
,
from
bizarre
situations
.
Therefore
to
Helva
,
the
problem
that
she
couldn't
open
her
mouth
to
sing
,
among
other
restrictions
,
did
not
bother
her
.
She
would
work
out
a
method
,
by-passing
her
limitations
,
whereby
she
could
sing
.
She
approached
the
problem
by
investigating
the
methods
of
sound
reproduction
through
the
centuries
,
human
and
instrumental
.
Her
own
sound
production
equipment
was
essentially
more
instrumental
than
vocal
.
Breath
control
and
the
proper
enunciation
of
vowel
sounds
within
the
oral
cavity
appeared
to
require
the
most
development
and
practice
.
Shell
people
did
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
breathe
.
For
their
purposes
,
oxygen
and
other
gases
were
not
drawn
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
through
the
medium
of
lungs
but
sustained
artificially
by
solution
in
their
shells
.
After
experimentation
,
Helva
discovered
that
she
could
manipulate
her
diaphragmic
unit
to
sustain
tone
.
By
relaxing
the
throat
muscles
and
expanding
the
oral
cavity
well
into
the
frontal
sinuses
,
she
could
direct
the
vowel
sounds
into
the
most
felicitous
position
for
proper
reproduction
through
her
throat
microphone
.
She
compared
the
results
with
tape
recordings
of
modern
singers
and
was
not
unpleased
although
her
own
tapes
had
a
peculiar
quality
about
them
,
not
at
all
unharmonious
,
merely
unique
.
Acquiring
a
repertoire
from
the
Laboratory
library
was
no
problem
to
one
trained
to
perfect
recall
.
She
found
herself
able
to
sing
any
role
and
any
song
which
struck
her
fancy
.
It
would
not
have
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
curious
for
a
female
to
sing
bass
,
baritone
,
tenor
,
alto
,
mezzo
,
soprano
and
coloratura
as
she
pleased
.
It
was
,
to
Helva
,
only
a
matter
of
the
correct
reproduction
and
diaphragmic
control
required
by
the
music
attempted
.
If
the
authorities
remarked
on
her
curious
avocation
,
they
did
so
among
themselves
.
Shell
people
were
encouraged
to
develop
a
hobby
so
long
as
they
maintained
proficiency
in
their
technical
work
.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
sixteenth
year
in
her
shell
,
Helva
was
unconditionally
graduated
and
installed
in
her
ship
,
the
Aj
.
Her
permanent
titanium
shell
was
recessed
behind
an
even
more
indestructible
barrier
in
the
central
shaft
of
the
scout
ship
.
The
neural
,
audio
,
visual
and
sensory
connections
were
made
and
sealed
.
Her
extendibles
were
diverted
,
connected
or
augmented
and
the
final
,
delicate-beyond-description
brain
taps
were
completed
while
Helva
remained
anesthetically
unaware
of
the
proceedings
.
When
she
awoke
,
she
was
the
ship
.
Her
brain
and
intelligence
controlled
every
function
from
navigation
to
such
loading
as
a
scout
ship
of
her
class
needed
.
She
could
take
care
of
herself
and
her
ambulatory
half
,
in
any
situation
already
recorded
in
the
annals
of
Central
Worlds
and
any
situation
its
most
fertile
minds
could
imagine
.
Her
first
actual
flight
,
for
she
and
her
kind
had
made
mock
flights
on
dummy
panels
since
she
was
eight
,
showed
her
complete
mastery
of
the
techniques
of
her
profession
.
She
was
ready
for
her
great
adventures
and
the
arrival
of
her
mobile
partner
.
There
were
nine
qualified
scouts
sitting
around
collecting
base
pay
the
day
Helva
was
commissioned
.
There
were
several
missions
which
demanded
instant
attention
but
Helva
had
been
of
interest
to
several
department
heads
in
Central
for
some
time
and
each
man
was
determined
to
have
her
assigned
to
his
section
.
Consequently
no
one
had
remembered
to
introduce
Helva
to
the
prospective
partners
.
The
ship
always
chose
its
own
partner
.
Had
there
been
another
``
brain
''
ship
at
the
Base
at
the
moment
,
Helva
would
have
been
guided
to
make
the
first
move
.
As
it
was
,
while
Central
wrangled
among
itself
,
Robert
Tanner
sneaked
out
of
the
pilots'
barracks
,
out
to
the
field
and
over
to
Helva's
slim
metal
hull
.
``
Hello
,
anyone
at
home
''
?
?
Tanner
wisecracked
.
``
Of
course
''
,
replied
Helva
logically
,
activating
her
outside
scanners
.
``
Are
you
my
partner
''
?
?
She
asked
hopefully
,
as
she
recognized
the
Scout
Service
uniform
.
``
All
you
have
to
do
is
ask
''
,
he
retorted
hopefully
.
``
No
one
has
come
.
I
thought
perhaps
there
were
no
partners
available
and
I've
had
no
directives
from
Central
''
.
Even
to
herself
Helva
sounded
a
little
self-pitying
but
the
truth
was
she
was
lonely
,
sitting
on
the
darkened
field
.
Always
she
had
had
the
company
of
other
shells
and
more
recently
,
technicians
by
the
score
.
The
sudden
solitude
had
lost
its
momentary
charm
and
become
oppressive
.
``
No
directives
from
Central
is
scarcely
a
cause
for
regret
,
but
there
happen
to
be
eight
other
guys
biting
their
fingernails
to
the
quick
just
waiting
for
an
invitation
to
board
you
,
you
beautiful
thing
''
.
It
would
have
killed
you
in
the
cabin
.
Do
you
have
anything
for
me
''
?
?
Mercer
stammered
,
not
knowing
what
B'dikkat
meant
,
and
the
two-nosed
man
answered
for
him
,
``
I
think
he
has
a
nice
baby
head
,
but
it
isn't
big
enough
for
you
to
take
yet
''
.
Mercer
never
noticed
the
needle
touch
his
arm
.
B'dikkat
had
turned
to
the
next
knot
of
people
when
the
super-condamine
hit
Mercer
.
He
tried
to
run
after
B'dikkat
,
to
hug
the
lead
spacesuit
,
to
tell
B'dikkat
that
he
loved
him
.
He
stumbled
and
fell
,
but
it
did
not
hurt
.
The
many-bodied
girl
lay
near
him
.
Mercer
spoke
to
her
.
``
Isn't
it
wonderful
?
?
You're
beautiful
,
beautiful
,
beautiful
.
I'm
so
happy
to
be
here
''
.
The
woman
covered
with
growing
hands
came
and
sat
beside
them
.
She
radiated
warmth
and
good
fellowship
.
Mercer
thought
that
she
looked
very
distinguished
and
charming
.
He
struggled
out
of
his
clothes
.
It
was
foolish
and
snobbish
to
wear
clothing
when
none
of
these
nice
people
did
.
The
two
women
babbled
and
crooned
at
him
.
With
one
corner
of
his
mind
he
knew
that
they
were
saying
nothing
,
just
expressing
the
euphoria
of
a
drug
so
powerful
that
the
known
universe
had
forbidden
it
.
With
most
of
his
mind
he
was
happy
.
He
wondered
how
anyone
could
have
the
good
luck
to
visit
a
planet
as
nice
as
this
.
He
tried
to
tell
the
Lady
Da
,
but
the
words
weren't
quite
straight
.
A
painful
stab
hit
him
in
the
abdomen
.
The
drug
went
after
the
pain
and
swallowed
it
.
It
was
like
the
cap
in
the
hospital
,
only
a
thousand
times
better
.
The
pain
was
gone
,
though
it
had
been
crippling
the
first
time
.
He
forced
himself
to
be
deliberate
.
He
rammed
his
mind
into
focus
and
said
to
the
two
ladies
who
lay
pinkly
nude
beside
him
in
the
desert
,
``
That
was
a
good
bite
.
Maybe
I
will
grow
another
head
.
That
would
make
B'dikkat
happy
''
!
!
The
Lady
Da
forced
the
foremost
of
her
bodies
in
an
upright
position
.
Said
she
,
``
I'm
strong
,
too
.
I
can
talk
.
Remember
,
man
,
remember
.
People
never
live
forever
.
We
can
die
,
too
,
we
can
die
like
real
people
.
I
do
so
believe
in
death
''
!
!
Mercer
smiled
at
her
through
his
happiness
.
``
Of
course
you
can
.
But
isn't
this
nice
''
With
this
he
felt
his
lips
thicken
and
his
mind
go
slack
.
He
was
wide
awake
,
but
he
did
not
feel
like
doing
anything
.
In
that
beautiful
place
,
among
all
those
companionable
and
attractive
people
,
he
sat
and
smiled
.
B'dikkat
was
sterilizing
his
knives
.
Mercer
wondered
how
long
the
super-condamine
had
lasted
him
.
He
endured
the
ministrations
of
the
dromozoa
without
screams
or
movement
.
The
agonies
of
nerves
and
itching
of
skin
were
phenomena
which
happened
somewhere
near
him
,
but
meant
nothing
.
He
watched
his
own
body
with
remote
,
casual
interest
.
The
Lady
Da
and
the
hand-covered
woman
stayed
near
him
.
After
a
long
time
the
half-man
dragged
himself
over
to
the
group
with
his
powerful
arms
.
Having
arrived
he
blinked
sleepily
and
friendlily
at
them
,
and
lapsed
back
into
the
restful
stupor
from
which
he
had
emerged
.
Mercer
saw
the
sun
rise
on
occasion
,
closed
his
eyes
briefly
,
and
opened
them
to
see
stars
shining
.
Time
had
no
meaning
.
The
dromozoa
fed
him
in
their
mysterious
way
;
;
the
drug
canceled
out
his
needs
for
cycles
of
the
body
.
At
last
he
noticed
a
return
of
the
inwardness
of
pain
.
The
pains
themselves
had
not
changed
;
;
he
had
.
He
knew
all
the
events
which
could
take
place
on
Shayol
.
He
remembered
them
well
from
his
happy
period
.
Formerly
he
had
noticed
them
--
now
he
felt
them
.
He
tried
to
ask
the
Lady
Da
how
long
they
had
had
the
drug
,
and
how
much
longer
they
would
have
to
wait
before
they
had
it
again
.
She
smiled
at
him
with
benign
,
remote
happiness
;
;
apparently
her
many
torsos
,
stretched
out
along
the
ground
,
had
a
greater
capacity
for
retaining
the
drug
than
did
his
body
.
She
meant
him
well
,
but
was
in
no
condition
for
articulate
speech
.
The
half-man
lay
on
the
ground
,
arteries
pulsating
prettily
behind
the
half-transparent
film
which
protected
his
abdominal
cavity
.
Mercer
squeezed
the
man's
shoulder
.
The
half-man
woke
,
recognized
Mercer
and
gave
him
a
healthily
sleepy
grin
.
``
'
A
good
morrow
to
you
,
my
boy
.
That's
out
of
a
play
.
Did
you
ever
see
a
play
''
?
?
``
You
mean
a
game
with
cards
''
?
?
``
No
''
,
said
the
half-man
,
``
a
sort
of
eye-machine
with
real
people
doing
the
figures
''
.
``
I
never
saw
that
''
,
said
Mercer
,
``
but
I
''
--
``
But
you
want
to
ask
me
when
B'dikkat
is
going
to
come
back
with
the
needle
''
.
``
Yes
''
,
said
Mercer
,
a
little
ashamed
of
his
obviousness
.
``
Soon
''
,
said
the
half-man
.
That's
why
I
think
of
plays
.
We
all
know
what
is
going
to
happen
.
We
all
know
when
it
is
going
to
happen
.
We
all
know
what
the
dummies
will
do
''
--
he
gestured
at
the
hummocks
in
which
the
decorticated
men
were
cradled
--
``
and
we
all
know
what
the
new
people
will
ask
.
But
we
never
know
how
long
a
scene
is
going
to
take
''
.
``
What's
a
'
scene
'
''
?
?
Asked
Mercer
.
``
Is
that
the
name
for
the
needle
''
?
?
The
half-man
laughed
with
something
close
to
real
humor
.
``
No
,
no
,
no
.
You've
got
the
lovelies
on
the
brain
.
A
scene
is
just
a
part
of
a
play
.
I
mean
we
know
the
order
in
which
things
happen
,
but
we
have
no
clocks
and
nobody
cares
enough
to
count
days
or
to
make
calendars
and
there's
not
much
climate
here
,
so
none
of
us
know
how
long
anything
takes
.
The
pain
seems
short
and
the
pleasure
seems
long
.
I'm
inclined
to
think
that
they
are
about
two
Earth-weeks
each
''
.
Mercer
did
not
know
what
an
``
Earth-week
''
was
,
since
he
had
not
been
a
well-read
man
before
his
conviction
,
but
he
got
nothing
more
from
the
half-man
at
that
time
.
The
half-man
received
a
dromozootic
implant
,
turned
red
in
the
face
,
shouted
senselessly
at
Mercer
,
``
Take
it
out
,
you
fool
!
!
Take
it
out
of
me
''
!
!
When
Mercer
looked
on
helplessly
,
the
half-man
twisted
over
on
his
side
,
his
pink
dusty
back
turned
to
Mercer
,
and
wept
hoarsely
and
quietly
to
himself
.
Mercer
himself
could
not
tell
how
long
it
was
before
B'dikkat
came
back
.
It
might
have
been
several
days
.
It
might
have
been
several
months
.
Once
again
B'dikkat
moved
among
them
like
a
father
;
;
once
again
they
clustered
like
children
.
This
time
B'dikkat
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
little
head
which
had
grown
out
of
Mercer's
thigh
--
a
sleeping
child's
head
,
covered
with
light
hair
on
top
and
with
dainty
eyebrows
over
the
resting
eyes
.
Mercer
got
the
blissful
needle
.
When
B'dikkat
cut
the
head
from
Mercer's
thigh
,
he
felt
the
knife
grinding
against
the
cartilage
which
held
the
head
to
his
own
body
.
He
saw
the
child-face
grimace
as
the
head
was
cut
;
;
he
felt
the
far
,
cool
flash
of
unimportant
pain
,
as
B'dikkat
dabbed
the
wound
with
a
corrosive
antiseptic
which
stopped
all
bleeding
immediately
.
The
next
time
it
was
two
legs
growing
from
his
chest
.
Then
there
had
been
another
head
beside
his
own
.
Or
was
that
after
the
torso
and
legs
,
waist
to
toe-tips
,
of
the
little
girl
which
had
grown
from
his
side
?
?
He
forgot
the
order
.
He
did
not
count
time
.
Lady
Da
smiled
at
him
often
,
but
there
was
no
love
in
this
place
.
She
had
lost
the
extra
torsos
.
In
between
teratologies
,
she
was
a
pretty
and
shapely
woman
;
;
but
the
nicest
thing
about
their
relationship
was
her
whisper
to
him
,
repeated
some
thousands
of
time
,
repeated
with
smiles
and
hope
,
``
People
never
live
forever
''
.
She
found
this
immensely
comforting
,
even
though
Mercer
did
not
make
much
sense
out
of
it
.
Thus
events
occurred
,
and
victims
changed
in
appearance
,
and
new
ones
arrived
.
Sometimes
B'dikkat
took
the
new
ones
,
resting
in
the
everlasting
sleep
of
their
burned-out
brains
,
in
a
ground-truck
to
be
added
to
other
herds
.
The
bodies
in
the
truck
threshed
and
bawled
without
human
speech
when
the
dromozoa
struck
them
.
Finally
,
Mercer
did
manage
to
follow
B'dikkat
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
.
He
had
to
fight
the
bliss
of
super-condamine
to
do
it
.
Only
the
memory
of
previous
hurt
,
bewilderment
and
perplexity
made
him
sure
that
if
he
did
not
ask
B'dikkat
when
he
,
Mercer
,
was
happy
,
the
answer
would
no
longer
be
available
when
he
needed
it
.
Fighting
pleasure
itself
,
he
begged
B'dikkat
to
check
the
records
and
to
tell
him
how
long
he
had
been
there
.
B'dikkat
grudgingly
agreed
,
but
he
did
not
come
out
of
the
doorway
.
He
spoke
through
the
public
address
box
built
into
the
cabin
,
and
his
gigantic
voice
roared
out
over
the
empty
plain
,
so
that
the
pink
herd
of
talking
people
stirred
gently
in
their
happiness
and
wondered
what
their
friend
B'dikkat
might
be
wanting
to
tell
them
.
When
he
said
it
,
they
thought
it
exceedingly
profound
,
though
none
of
them
understood
it
,
since
it
was
simply
the
amount
of
time
that
Mercer
had
been
on
Shayol
:
``
Standard
years
--
eighty-four
years
,
seven
months
,
three
days
,
two
hours
,
eleven
and
one
half
minutes
.
Good
luck
,
fellow
''
.
Mercer
turned
away
.
The
secret
little
corner
of
his
mind
,
which
stayed
sane
through
happiness
and
pain
,
made
him
wonder
about
B'dikkat
.
What
persuaded
the
cow-man
to
remain
on
Shayol
?
?
What
kept
him
happy
without
super-condamine
?
?
Was
B'dikkat
a
crazy
slave
to
his
own
duty
or
was
he
a
man
who
had
hopes
of
going
back
to
his
own
planet
some
day
,
surrounded
by
a
family
of
little
cow-people
resembling
himself
?
?
Mercer
,
despite
his
happiness
,
wept
a
little
at
the
strange
fate
of
B'dikkat
.
His
own
fate
he
accepted
.
He
remembered
the
last
time
he
had
eaten
--
actual
eggs
from
an
actual
pan
.
The
dromozoa
kept
him
alive
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
they
did
it
.
He
staggered
back
to
the
group
.
The
Lady
Da
,
naked
in
the
dusty
plain
,
waved
a
hospitable
hand
and
showed
that
there
was
a
place
for
him
to
sit
beside
her
.
There
were
unclaimed
square
miles
of
seating
space
around
them
,
but
he
appreciated
the
kindliness
of
her
gesture
none
the
less
.
4
,
The
years
,
if
they
were
years
,
went
by
.
The
land
of
Shayol
did
not
change
.
Sometimes
the
bubbling
sound
of
geysers
came
faintly
across
the
plain
to
the
herd
of
men
;
;
those
who
could
talk
declared
it
to
be
the
breathing
of
Captain
Alvarez
.
There
was
night
and
day
,
but
no
setting
of
crops
,
no
change
of
season
,
no
generations
of
men
.
Time
stood
still
for
these
people
,
and
their
load
of
pleasure
was
so
commingled
with
the
shocks
and
pains
of
the
dromozoa
that
the
words
of
the
Lady
Da
took
on
very
remote
meaning
.
``
People
never
live
forever
''
.
Her
statement
was
a
hope
,
not
a
truth
in
which
they
could
believe
.
They
did
not
have
the
wit
to
follow
the
stars
in
their
courses
,
to
exchange
names
with
each
other
,
to
harvest
the
experience
of
each
for
the
wisdom
of
all
.
There
was
no
dream
of
escape
for
these
people
.
Though
they
saw
the
old-style
chemical
rockets
lift
up
from
the
field
beyond
B'dikkat's
cabin
,
they
did
not
make
plans
to
hide
among
the
frozen
crop
of
transmuted
flesh
.
Far
long
ago
,
some
other
prisoner
than
one
of
these
had
tried
to
write
a
letter
.
His
handwriting
was
on
a
rock
.
Mercer
read
it
,
and
so
had
a
few
of
the
others
,
but
they
could
not
tell
which
man
had
done
it
.
Nor
did
they
care
.
The
letter
,
scraped
on
stone
,
had
been
a
message
home
.
They
could
still
read
the
opening
:
``
Once
,
I
was
like
you
,
stepping
out
of
my
window
at
the
end
of
day
,
and
letting
the
winds
blow
me
gently
toward
the
place
I
lived
in
.
Once
,
like
you
,
I
had
one
head
,
two
hands
,
ten
fingers
on
my
hands
.
The
front
part
of
my
head
was
called
a
face
,
and
I
could
talk
with
it
.
Now
I
can
only
write
,
and
that
only
when
I
get
out
of
pain
.
Dan
Morgan
told
himself
he
would
forget
Ann
Turner
.
He
was
well
rid
of
her
.
He
certainly
didn't
want
a
wife
who
was
fickle
as
Ann
.
If
he
had
married
her
,
he'd
have
been
asking
for
trouble
.
But
all
of
this
was
rationalization
.
Sometimes
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
of
Ann
,
and
then
could
not
get
back
to
sleep
.
His
plans
and
dreams
had
revolved
around
her
so
much
and
for
so
long
that
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
.
The
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell
out
to
Al
Budd
and
leave
the
country
,
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
wouldn't
allow
it
.
The
best
antidote
for
the
bitterness
and
disappointment
that
poisoned
him
was
hard
work
.
He
found
that
if
he
was
tired
enough
at
night
,
he
went
to
sleep
simply
because
he
was
too
exhausted
to
stay
awake
.
Each
day
he
found
himself
thinking
less
often
of
Ann
;
;
each
day
the
hurt
was
a
little
duller
,
a
little
less
poignant
.
He
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
.
Because
the
summer
was
unusually
dry
and
hot
,
the
spring
produced
a
smaller
stream
than
in
ordinary
years
.
The
grass
in
the
meadows
came
fast
,
now
that
the
warm
weather
was
here
.
He
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
drop
of
the
precious
water
,
so
he
spent
most
of
his
waking
hours
along
the
ditches
in
his
meadows
.
He
had
no
idea
how
much
time
Budd
would
give
him
.
In
any
case
,
he
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
asleep
,
so
he
carried
his
revolver
in
its
holster
on
his
hip
and
he
took
his
Winchester
with
him
and
leaned
it
against
the
fence
.
He
stopped
every
few
minutes
and
leaned
on
his
shovel
as
he
studied
the
horizon
,
but
nothing
happened
,
each
day
dragging
out
with
monotonous
calm
.
When
,
in
late
afternoon
on
the
last
day
in
June
,
he
saw
two
people
top
the
ridge
to
the
south
and
walk
toward
the
house
,
he
quit
work
immediately
and
strode
to
his
rifle
.
It
could
be
some
kind
of
trick
Budd
had
thought
up
.
No
one
walked
in
this
country
,
least
of
all
Ed
Dow
or
Dutch
Renfro
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
Bar
B
crew
.
Morgan
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
time
,
puzzled
.
When
they
were
closer
and
he
saw
that
one
was
a
woman
,
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
.
He
cleaned
his
shovel
,
left
it
against
the
fence
,
picked
up
his
Winchester
,
and
started
downstream
.
His
visitors
had
crawled
through
the
south
fence
and
were
crossing
the
meadow
,
angling
toward
the
house
.
Now
he
saw
that
both
the
man
and
woman
were
moving
slowly
and
irregularly
,
staggering
,
as
if
they
found
it
a
struggle
to
remain
on
their
feet
.
Reaching
the
house
ahead
of
them
,
he
waited
with
his
Winchester
in
his
hands
.
They
crawled
through
the
north
fence
and
came
on
toward
him
,
and
now
he
saw
that
both
were
young
,
not
more
than
nineteen
or
twenty
.
They
were
dirty
,
their
clothes
were
torn
,
and
the
girl
was
so
exhausted
that
she
fell
when
she
was
still
twenty
feet
from
the
front
door
.
She
lay
there
,
making
no
effort
to
get
back
on
her
feet
.
The
boy
came
on
to
the
porch
and
sat
down
,
his
gaze
on
Morgan
as
if
half
expecting
him
to
shoot
and
not
really
caring
.
Morgan
hesitated
,
thinking
that
if
this
was
a
trick
,
it
was
a
good
one
.
He
didn't
think
it
was
possible
for
this
couple
to
be
pretending
.
The
boy
licked
his
dry
lips
.
He
asked
,
``
Could
we
have
a
drink
''
?
?
Morgan
jerked
his
head
toward
the
front
door
.
``
In
the
kitchen
''
,
he
said
.
Leaning
his
Winchester
against
the
front
of
the
house
,
he
walked
to
the
girl
.
``
Get
up
.
There's
water
in
the
house
''
.
She
didn't
move
or
say
anything
.
Her
eyes
were
glazed
as
if
she
didn't
hear
or
even
see
him
.
She
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
didn't
even
care
how
she
looked
.
Her
face
was
very
thin
,
and
burned
by
the
sun
until
much
of
the
skin
was
dead
and
peeling
,
the
new
skin
under
it
red
and
angry
.
Her
blond
hair
was
frowzy
,
her
dress
torn
in
several
places
,
and
her
shoes
were
so
completely
worn
out
that
they
were
practically
no
protection
.
It
must
have
hurt
her
even
to
walk
,
for
the
sole
was
completely
off
her
left
foot
and
Morgan
saw
that
it
was
bruised
and
bleeding
.
He
picked
her
up
,
sliding
one
hand
under
her
shoulders
,
the
other
under
her
knees
,
and
carried
her
into
the
house
.
She
was
amazingly
light
,
and
so
relaxed
in
his
arms
that
he
wasn't
even
sure
she
was
conscious
.
Any
lingering
suspicion
that
this
was
a
trick
Al
Budd
had
thought
up
was
dispelled
.
No
girl
would
go
this
far
to
fool
a
man
so
she
could
kill
him
.
Besides
,
she
had
a
sweet
face
that
attracted
him
.
He
put
her
down
on
the
couch
,
and
going
into
the
kitchen
,
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
.
They
looked
a
good
deal
alike
,
Morgan
thought
.
Both
had
blonde
hair
and
blue
eyes
,
and
there
was
even
a
faint
similarity
of
features
.
Morgan
filled
the
dipper
from
the
water
bucket
on
the
shelf
,
went
back
into
the
front
room
,
lifted
the
girl's
head
,
and
held
the
edge
of
the
dipper
to
her
mouth
.
She
drank
greedily
,
and
murmured
,
``
Thank
you
''
,
as
he
lowered
her
head
.
He
stood
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
,
wondering
what
could
have
reduced
her
to
this
condition
.
He
had
seen
a
few
nester
wagons
go
through
the
country
,
the
families
almost
starving
to
death
,
but
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
on
foot
and
as
bad
off
as
these
two
.
The
girl
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
Morgan
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
built
a
fire
,
and
carried
in
several
buckets
of
water
from
the
spring
which
he
poured
into
the
copper
boiler
that
he
had
placed
on
the
stove
.
He
brought
his
Winchester
in
from
the
front
of
the
house
,
then
faced
the
boy
.
``
Who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
I'm
Billy
Jones
''
,
the
boy
answered
.
``
That's
my
wife
Sharon
.
We
ran
out
of
money
and
we
haven't
eaten
for
two
days
''
.
``
What
are
you
doing
here
''
?
?
``
Are
we
in
Wyoming
''
?
?
Morgan
nodded
.
``
About
five
miles
north
of
the
line
''
.
Jones
sighed
as
if
relieved
.
``
We've
been
looking
for
work
,
but
all
the
ranchers
have
turned
us
down
''
.
``
You
mean
you
dragged
your
wife
all
over
hell's
half-acre
looking
for
work
''
?
?
Morgan
demanded
.
``
The
town
of
Buckhorn's
only
about
six
miles
from
here
.
Why
didn't
you
go
there
''
?
?
``
We
didn't
want
town
work
''
,
Jones
said
.
``
This
is
a
mighty
empty
country
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
There's
only
one
more
ranch
three
miles
north
of
here
.
You'd
have
starved
to
death
if
you'd
missed
both
places
''
.
``
Then
we're
lucky
we
got
here
.
Could
you
give
us
a
job
,
Mr.
''
``
Morgan
.
Dan
Morgan
''
.
He
was
silent
a
moment
,
thinking
he
could
use
a
man
this
time
of
year
,
and
if
the
girl
could
cook
,
it
would
give
him
more
time
in
the
meadows
,
but
he
knew
nothing
about
the
couple
.
They
might
kill
him
in
his
sleep
,
thinking
there
was
money
in
the
house
.
He
dismissed
the
possibility
at
once
.
The
girl's
thin
face
haunted
him
.
It
wasn't
the
face
of
a
killer
.
He
wasn't
so
sure
about
the
boy
.
He
hadn't
shaved
for
several
weeks
,
his
sparse
beard
giving
his
face
a
pathetic
,
woebegone
expression
.
There
was
more
to
this
than
Jones
had
told
him
.
They
were
running
from
something
.
He'd
be
an
idiot
to
let
them
stay
he
thought
,
but
he
couldn't
send
them
on
,
either
.
``
I
could
use
some
help
''
,
Morgan
said
finally
,
``
but
I
can't
afford
to
pay
you
anything
.
I
guess
you'd
better
go
on
in
the
morning
''
.
``
We'll
work
for
our
keep
''
,
the
boy
said
eagerly
.
``
I've
been
mucking
in
a
mine
in
the
San
Juan
,
but
I
used
to
work
on
a
ranch
.
Sharon
,
she's
cooked
in
a
restaurant
.
We'll
work
hard
,
Mr.
Morgan
''
.
``
I'll
see
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
Right
now
you
need
a
meal
and
a
bath
.
Your
wife's
in
terrible
shape
''
.
``
I
know
''
,
Jones
said
dejectedly
.
Morgan
filled
the
fire
box
with
wood
again
,
then
started
supper
and
set
the
table
.
When
the
meal
was
ready
,
he
told
Jones
to
wash
up
,
and
going
into
the
front
room
,
woke
the
girl
.
He
said
,
``
I've
got
some
supper
ready
''
.
She
rubbed
her
eyes
and
stretched
,
then
sat
up
,
her
hands
going
to
her
hair
.
``
I'm
a
mess
''
,
she
said
,
and
suddenly
she
was
alarmed
.
``
Who
are
you
?
?
How
did
we
get
here
''
?
?
``
I'm
Dan
Morgan
.
This
is
the
Rafter
Aj
.
You
fell
down
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
I
carried
you
in
.
I
gave
you
a
drink
and
then
you
went
to
sleep
''
.
``
Oh
''
.
She
stared
at
him
,
her
eyes
wide
as
she
thought
about
what
he
had
said
;
;
then
she
murmured
:
``
You're
very
kind
,
Mr.
Morgan
.
Do
you
take
in
all
the
strays
who
come
by
''
?
?
``
I
don't
have
many
strays
coming
to
my
front
door
''
,
he
said
.
``
Think
you
can
walk
to
the
table
''
?
?
``
Of
course
''
.
She
got
to
her
feet
,
staggered
,
and
almost
fell
.
He
caught
her
by
an
arm
and
helped
her
into
the
kitchen
.
She
sat
down
at
the
table
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
I'm
sorry
,
Mr.
Morgan
.
I'm
usually
a
very
strong
woman
,
but
I'm
awfully
tired
''
.
``
And
hungry
''
,
he
said
.
``
Start
in
.
It's
not
much
of
a
meal
,
but
it's
what
I
eat
''
.
``
Not
much
of
a
meal
''
?
?
The
girl
cried
.
``
Mr.
Morgan
,
it's
the
best-looking
food
I
ever
saw
''
.
He
told
himself
he
had
never
seen
two
people
eat
so
much
.
When
they
were
finally
satisfied
,
Jones
said
,
``
I
think
he's
going
to
give
us
work
''
.
The
grateful
way
she
looked
at
Morgan
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.
When
he
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
,
he
knew
he
couldn't
send
them
on
.
She
said
,
``
I
guess
the
Lord
looks
out
for
fools
,
drunkards
,
and
innocents
''
.
Morgan
laughed
.
``
Which
are
you
''
?
?
``
We're
not
drunkards
''
,
she
said
.
``
That's
all
I'm
sure
of
''
.
She
helped
him
with
the
dishes
,
then
he
brought
more
water
in
from
the
spring
before
it
got
dark
.
He
carried
the
tub
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
it
hung
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
.
He
said
:
``
You'll
feel
a
lot
better
after
you
have
a
bath
.
Your
feet
are
in
bad
shape
,
Mrs.
Jones
.
You'll
have
to
go
to
town
to
see
the
doc
''
.
``
No
,
she'll
be
all
right
''
,
Jones
said
quickly
.
``
I
mean
,
we
don't
have
any
way
to
get
there
and
we
can't
expect
you
to
quit
work
just
to
take
us
to
town
''
.
``
We'll
see
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
Could
you
find
me
a
needle
and
thread
''
?
?
The
girl
asked
.
``
My
dress
needs
some
work
on
it
''
.
He
nodded
and
,
going
into
the
bedroom
,
brought
a
needle
,
thread
,
and
scissors
.
He
said
:
``
I'm
going
to
bed
''
.
He
nodded
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
.
``
That's
my
spare
bedroom
.
The
bed
isn't
made
,
but
you'll
find
plenty
of
blankets
there
''
.
``
You're
awfully
kind
''
,
the
girl
said
.
``
We'll
pay
you
back
if
you'll
let
us
.
Some
way
''
.
``
It's
all
right
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
get
up
early
.
You'd
better
sleep
''
.
Jones
followed
him
into
the
front
room
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
.
He
said
:
``
If
it's
all
right
with
you
,
Mr.
Morgan
,
I'll
sleep
out
here
on
the
couch
.
We
haven't
slept
together
since
we
started
.
I
just
can't
take
any
chances
on
getting
her
pregnant
,
and
if
we
were
sleeping
together
''
He
stopped
,
embarrassed
,
and
Morgan
said
,
``
I
understand
that
,
but
I
don't
savvy
why
you'd
go
off
and
leave
your
jobs
in
the
first
place
''
.
``
We
got
fired
''
,
Jones
said
.
``
We
had
to
do
something
''
.
They
were
a
pair
of
lost
,
whipped
kids
,
Morgan
thought
as
he
went
to
bed
.
Gavin
paused
wearily
.
``
You
can't
stay
here
with
me
.
It's
late
and
you
said
they'd
be
here
by
dawn
''
.
``
You
can't
make
me
go
''
.
Gavin
sank
down
again
into
his
chair
and
began
to
rock
.
He
was
thinking
of
Rittenhouse
and
how
he
had
left
him
there
,
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
Splendide
.
It
was
the
only
thing
in
his
life
for
which
he
felt
guilt
.
Beneath
his
black
shirt
his
frail
shoulders
shook
and
croaks
of
pain
broke
from
his
throat
,
the
stored
pain
shattering
free
in
slow
gasps
,
terrible
to
see
.
Clayton
tried
to
call
back
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
known
.
Against
that
other
man
he
could
rally
his
anger
;
;
against
this
bent
man
in
the
chair
he
was
powerless
.
Gavin's
lips
moved
so
that
Clayton
had
to
stoop
to
catch
the
words
.
``
Do
you
remember
Big
Charlie
''
?
?
He
whispered
.
``
He
stuck
with
me
all
these
years
.
Just
a
half-breed
'pache
,
never
said
much
,
never
meant
anythin
to
me
,
but
he
stuck
with
me
.
He
got
into
a
fight
with
Tom
English
,
your
brother's
son
.
It
was
a
fair
fight
,
the
boy
provoked
it
--
Big
Charlie
told
me
so
.
I
believed
him
.
They
killed
Big
Charlie
,
dumped
his
body
in
my
rose
garden
two
nights
ago
.
My
men
,
they
all
left
me
.
Just
cleared
out
.
I
didn't
understand
why
,
Clay
.
They
just
all
cleared
out
.
I
treated
them
fair
''
He
wiped
his
lips
with
a
sleeve
,
then
stared
at
Clayton
in
a
childish
kind
of
wonder
.
``
Do
you
mean
''
--
he
asked
almost
shyly
--
``
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
,
wherever
you're
goin
''
?
?
``
Yes
''
.
``
You
don't
hate
me
any
more
''
?
?
Clayton
choked
,
shook
his
head
,
murmuring
,
``
No
''
.
``
Come
here
''
.
The
old
man
beckoned
with
one
finger
and
Clayton
went
forward
to
him
.
Gavin
slipped
his
arms
around
his
chest
and
hugged
him
fiercely
.
``
All
my
life
''
,
he
said
,
``
I
tried
.
I
tried
.
I
saw
you
driftin
away
--
but
I
tried
.
And
you
wanted
no
part
of
me
when
I
had
so
much
to
give
.
Now
there's
nothin
left
of
me
.
Laurel
is
gone
,
my
men
are
gone
,
Ed
is
dead
--
and
you
come
to
me
,
to
help
me
.
Oh
!
!
God
in
Heaven
,
I
can't
refuse
you
now
.
That
would
mock
me
too
much
!
!
Can't
let
you
go
way
from
me
again
''
He
closed
his
eyes
,
ashamed
of
his
tears
.
``
I'll
go
,
Clay
''
.
Clayton
freed
himself
from
the
embrace
and
stepped
back
.
The
eyes
followed
him
fearfully
.
``
The
horses
.
There
isn't
much
time
.
I'll
saddle
the
horses
and
bring
them
round
.
You
get
ready
''
He
burst
from
the
hot
confinement
of
the
room
into
the
cold
night
air
.
Gavin's
stallion
was
in
the
barn
and
he
tightened
the
cinches
over
the
saddle
blanket
,
working
by
touch
in
the
darkness
,
comforting
the
animal
with
easy
words
.
When
he
had
finished
he
led
him
and
the
mare
to
the
porch
.
The
stallion
had
smelled
the
mare
coming
into
heat
and
began
to
paw
the
turf
,
shaking
his
head
.
Clayton
looped
the
reins
in
a
knot
over
the
veranda
post
and
patted
the
warm
flesh
of
his
neck
.
The
mare
had
backed
away
.
``
You
take
it
easy
,
boy
''
,
Clayton
whispered
.
``
She
doesn't
want
you
now
.
You
take
it
easy
,
your
time
will
come
''
.
Gavin
stood
on
the
porch
,
a
thin
figure
.
He
had
taken
a
carbine
down
from
the
wall
and
it
trailed
from
his
hand
,
the
stock
bumping
on
the
wood
floor
.
Clayton
called
to
him
and
he
came
slowly
down
the
steps
.
``
Clay
''
,
he
said
,
``
where
are
we
goin
''
?
?
``
To
a
ranch
in
the
valley
.
There's
someone
there
I
have
to
see
.
We
may
take
her
with
us
--
to
California
.
I
don't
know
yet
,
it's
crazy
;
;
I
have
to
think
about
it
.
But
California
is
where
we're
goin
''
.
``
California
''
.
Gavin
began
to
nod
.
``
That's
a
new
land
.
A
man
could
make
a
mark
there
.
Two
men
,
together
like
us
,
we
could
do
somethin
fine
out
there
,
maybe
find
a
place
where
no
one's
ever
been
.
Start
out
fresh
,
the
two
of
us
,
like
nothin
had
ever
happened
''
.
``
Yes
,
like
a
father
and
son
''
.
``
I
made
you
what
you
are
''
,
Gavin
whispered
.
``
I
made
you
so
you
could
stand
up
.
I
made
you
a
man
''
.
``
Yes
,
Gavin
,
you
did
''
.
He
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion's
quivering
neck
.
``
Help
me
up
,
Clay
.
Help
me
up
,
I
feel
kind
of
stiff
''
.
Clayton
lifted
him
gently
into
the
saddle
,
like
a
child
.
``
I
hate
to
leave
my
garden
''
,
Gavin
said
.
``
They'll
trample
it
down
.
I
loved
my
garden
''
.
``
It
will
grow
again
--
in
California
''
.
``
I
loved
this
valley
''
,
he
whispered
huskily
.
``
Lived
alone
here
for
three
years
,
before
any
man
came
.
Lived
alone
by
the
river
.
It
was
nice
then
,
so
peaceful
and
quiet
.
There
was
no
one
but
me
.
I
don't
want
to
leave
it
''
.
Clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion's
rump
.
The
two
horses
broke
from
the
yard
,
from
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
still
burning
in
the
house
,
into
the
darkness
.
Thirty-five
they
rode
at
a
measured
pace
through
the
valley
.
Dawn
would
come
soon
and
the
night
was
at
its
coldest
.
The
moon
had
sunk
below
the
black
crest
of
the
mountains
and
the
land
,
seen
through
eyes
that
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
absence
of
light
,
looked
primeval
,
as
if
no
man
had
ever
trespassed
before
.
It
looked
as
Gavin
had
first
seen
it
years
ago
,
on
those
nights
when
he
slept
alone
by
his
campfire
and
waked
suddenly
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rustle
of
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
moon's
wind
--
a
savage
land
,
untenanted
and
brooding
,
too
strong
to
be
broken
by
the
will
of
men
.
Gavin
sighed
bitterly
.
In
that
inert
landscape
the
caravan
of
his
desires
passed
before
his
mind
.
He
saw
them
ambushed
,
strewn
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
.
In
vain
his
mind
groped
to
reassemble
the
bones
of
the
relationships
he
had
sought
so
desperately
,
but
they
would
not
come
to
life
.
The
silence
oppressed
him
,
made
him
bend
low
over
the
horse's
neck
as
if
to
hide
from
a
wind
that
had
begun
to
blow
far
away
and
was
twisting
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
its
slow
search
.
They
passed
ranches
that
were
framed
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
.
Then
at
last
the
darkness
began
to
dissolve
.
A
bold
line
of
violet
broke
loose
from
the
high
ridge
of
the
mountains
,
followed
by
feathers
of
red
that
swept
the
last
stars
from
the
sky
.
The
wan
light
spread
over
the
ground
and
the
valley
revealed
in
the
first
glimmer
the
contours
of
trees
and
fences
and
palely
shadowed
gullies
.
They
had
been
seen
as
soon
as
they
left
the
ranch
,
picked
out
of
the
darkness
by
the
weary
though
watchful
eyes
of
two
men
posted
a
few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
windless
shelter
of
the
trees
.
The
two
men
whipped
their
horses
into
town
and
flung
themselves
up
the
steps
of
the
saloon
,
crying
their
intelligence
.
The
men
in
Pettigrew's
were
tired
from
a
night's
drinking
,
their
faces
red
and
baggy
.
But
the
liquor
had
flushed
their
courage
.
They
greeted
the
news
angrily
,
as
though
they
had
been
cheated
of
purpose
.
Lester
heard
their
muttering
,
saw
their
eyes
reveal
their
desire
.
He
worked
his
tongue
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
and
his
voice
came
out
of
his
throat
,
dry
and
cracked
.
``
He's
leavin
.
That's
what
you
wanted
,
isn't
it
?
?
Clayton
is
with
him
,
takin
him
out
of
the
valley
.
You
can't
''
--
``
Keep
out
of
this
''
,
Purvis
snarled
.
``
He's
not
your
brother
,
he's
Gavin's
son
.
You
see
,
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
''
.
Joe
Purvis
was
thinking
back
many
years
.
First
he
thought
of
the
time
he
had
ridden
to
Gavin
and
told
him
how
his
cattle
were
being
rustled
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
.
He
remembered
Gavin's
smirk
,
his
own
cringing
feeling
,
his
impotence
.
Then
he
thought
of
a
time
when
Clayton's
horse
had
fallen
lame
in
the
Gap
.
His
wife
had
said
to
him
:
``
Nellie
is
in
love
with
Clayton
Roy
.
He
wouldn't
even
dance
with
her
at
Gavin's
party
.
He
treats
her
like
she
was
dirt
.
And
you
stand
by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it
''
He
remembered
Clayton's
mocking
smile
in
the
saloon
when
he
had
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
they
brought
their
cattle
to
water
.
It
was
the
night
Clayton
had
tricked
them
in
the
poker
game
.
``
You're
Gavin's
son
''
,
Joe
Purvis
had
said
.
He
turned
to
Lester
.
``
You
brought
him
back
to
this
valley
thinkin
he
would
help
you
find
your
boy
.
He
meant
to
help
Gavin
all
the
time
.
He
made
a
fool
of
you
,
Lester
''
.
He
swung
round
to
the
other
men
--
``
We
can
catch
him
easy
!
!
There
are
plenty
of
fresh
horses
halfway
at
my
place
.
If
we
let
them
go
,
they
won't
stay
away
,
they'll
find
men
to
ride
with
them
and
they'll
be
back
.
There's
only
one
way
they
can
get
out
now
and
that's
through
the
Gap
--
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
''
.
Lester's
hand
fluttered
to
Cabot's
shoulder
.
The
boy
jerked
away
.
``
He
killed
Tom
--
do
you
understand
that
''
?
?
Cabot
turned
back
to
the
men
and
he
was
drunk
with
the
thing
they
would
do
,
wild
to
break
from
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
saloon
into
the
cold
of
the
ebbing
night
.
He
fled
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
,
running
,
and
the
men
grunted
and
followed
,
pushing
Lester
to
one
side
where
he
backed
against
the
wall
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
raised
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
light
.
Purvis
and
Silas
Pettigrew
were
the
last
to
leave
.
They
mounted
up
and
rode
slowly
behind
the
others
at
a
safe
distance
.
Thirty-six
in
the
cold
dawn
the
mist
swirled
low
to
the
ground
,
then
rose
with
a
gust
of
sudden
wind
to
leave
the
valley
clear
.
The
clouds
parted
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped
down
to
stain
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so
that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
.
When
they
turned
in
the
saddle
they
could
see
the
men
behind
them
,
strung
out
on
the
prairie
in
a
flat
black
line
.
The
wind
of
their
running
was
cold
and
wild
,
the
horses
were
lathered
and
their
manes
streamed
like
stiff
black
pennants
in
the
wind
.
The
mare
began
to
tire
and
Clayton
felt
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
Gavin's
stallion
.
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
.
They
neither
gained
nor
fell
back
.
He
rode
low
on
the
mare's
neck
.
Ahead
of
him
Gavin
turned
slightly
off
the
trail
and
pointed
for
the
Gap
,
no
more
than
a
mile
away
.
Gavin's
face
was
bloodless
with
excitement
.
He
did
not
look
back
;
;
he
could
feel
more
than
hear
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned
out
across
the
prairie
to
the
north
.
He
knew
who
was
riding
after
him
--
the
men
he
had
known
all
his
life
,
the
men
who
had
worked
for
him
,
sworn
their
loyalty
to
him
.
Now
they
were
riding
to
kill
him
.
And
he
was
fleeing
,
running
--
fleeing
his
death
and
his
life
at
the
same
time
.
The
land
over
which
he
sped
was
the
land
he
had
created
and
lived
in
:
his
valley
.
With
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been
his
,
that
he
would
never
see
again
.
The
Gap
looming
before
him
--
the
place
where
had
confronted
Jack
English
on
that
day
so
many
years
ago
--
was
his
exit
from
all
that
had
meaning
to
him
.
California
is
too
far
,
he
thought
.
He
would
never
reach
California
.
He
was
too
old
--
when
he
passed
up
and
through
the
corridor
of
pines
that
lined
the
trail
he
could
see
ahead
,
he
was
passing
from
life
.
The
sentry
was
not
dead
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
showing
signs
of
reviving
.
He
had
been
carrying
an
Enfield
rifle
and
a
holstered
navy
cap-and-ball
pistol
.
A
bayonet
hung
in
a
belt
scabbard
.
He
was
partially
uniformed
in
a
cavalry
tunic
and
hat
.
Mike
stripped
these
from
him
and
donned
them
.
He
and
Dean
tied
and
gagged
the
man
,
using
his
belt
and
shirt
for
the
purpose
.
They
dragged
him
inside
the
building
.
Fiske
joined
them
,
unsteady
on
his
feet
.
Julia
,
seeing
the
bandage
,
rushed
to
him
.
``
You
are
hurt
''
!
!
She
breathed
.
``
I
never
felt
better
in
my
life
''
,
Fiske
blustered
.
He
turned
to
Susan
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
``
Thank
you
,
My
dear
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
are
very
brave
''
.
Mike
silenced
them
.
``
We'll
talk
later
.
First
,
we've
got
to
get
out
of
here
''
.
``
We'll
grab
horses
''
,
Dean
said
.
``
The
main
bunch
is
outside
,
but
there
are
some
over
there
inside
the
wall
''
.
Mike
debated
it
,
trying
to
decide
whether
Fiske
was
strong
enough
to
ride
.
But
it
at
least
offered
him
a
chance
for
living
.
He
had
none
here
.
And
,
for
the
sake
of
Julia
and
Susan
,
it
had
to
be
tried
.
The
guerrilla
bivouac
remained
silent
.
Light
showed
in
the
orderly
room
across
the
parade
ground
.
Someone
evidently
was
on
duty
there
.
No
doubt
there
would
be
men
guarding
the
horses
.
About
a
dozen
animals
were
held
inside
the
stockade
,
as
best
Mike
could
make
out
in
the
moonlight
.
Evidently
this
was
a
precaution
so
that
mounts
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
.
He
handed
the
guard's
rifle
to
Fiske
.
``
Dean
and
myself
will
try
to
cut
out
horses
to
ride
''
,
he
said
.
``
We'll
stampede
the
rest
.
You
stay
with
the
ladies
.
All
of
you
be
ready
to
ride
hell
for
leather
''
.
He
added
,
``
If
this
doesn't
work
out
,
the
three
of
you
barricade
yourself
in
the
house
and
talk
terms
with
them
''
.
He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.
Susan
halted
Dean
and
kissed
him
.
She
clung
to
him
,
talking
to
him
,
and
dabbing
at
her
eyes
.
Mike
turned
away
.
He
was
thinking
that
the
way
she
had
responded
to
his
own
kiss
hadn't
meant
what
he
had
believed
it
had
.
He
felt
unutterably
weary
.
Dean
turned
from
Susan
and
took
Julia
Fortune
in
his
arms
.
He
kissed
her
also
,
and
with
deep
tenderness
.
She
too
began
to
weep
.
He
released
her
and
joined
Mike
.
``
All
right
''
,
he
said
.
Mike
only
said
,
``
Later
''
.
``
Be
careful
,
McLish
''
!
!
Susan
said
fiercely
.
``
The
way
you
were
careful
''
?
?
He
snorted
.
``
Running
around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
''
?
?
He
kept
going
.
He
wanted
no
more
sentimental
scenes
with
her
.
He
might
say
or
do
something
foolish
.
Something
all
of
them
would
regret
.
He
might
tell
her
how
sorry
a
spectacle
she
was
making
of
herself
,
pretending
to
be
blind
to
the
way
Julia
Fortune
had
taken
Dean's
affections
from
her
.
And
using
him
,
Mike
McLish
,
as
a
sop
to
her
pride
.
He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.
``
Stay
well
back
of
me
''
,
he
said
.
``
I'm
going
to
walk
up
to
the
horses
,
bold
as
brass
,
pretending
I'm
one
of
the
guerrillas
.
There's
bound
to
be
someone
on
guard
,
but
the
hat
might
fool
them
long
enough
for
me
to
get
close
''
.
Holding
the
pistol
concealed
,
he
walked
to
the
rear
wall
of
the
stockade
.
It
was
pierced
by
a
wagon
gate
built
of
two
wings
.
One
wing
stood
open
.
Mike
passed
through
it
and
moved
toward
the
dark
mass
of
horses
.
They
were
tethered
,
army
style
,
on
stable
lines
.
A
voice
spoke
near-at-hand
.
``
Who's
that
''
?
?
Just
me
''
,
Mike
said
.
``
Is
that
you
,
Bill
''
?
?
He
located
his
man
.
The
guard
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
stockade
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
the
moonlight
.
Mike
kept
walking
and
got
within
arm's
reach
before
the
man
became
suspicious
and
straightened
from
his
lax
slouch
.
Mike
struck
with
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
.
But
the
luck
that
had
been
running
their
way
left
him
.
The
guard
instinctively
parried
the
blow
with
his
rifle
.
He
tried
to
veer
the
rifle
around
to
fire
into
Mike's
body
.
Mike
,
off
balance
,
managed
to
bat
the
muzzle
away
a
moment
before
it
exploded
.
The
bullet
went
wide
.
Mike
swung
the
pistol
in
a
savage
backlash
.
This
time
it
connected
solidly
on
the
man's
temple
,
felling
him
.
The
explosion
of
the
rifle
had
crashed
against
the
walls
of
the
stockade
and
the
deep
echoes
were
still
rolling
in
the
hills
.
The
startled
horses
began
rearing
on
their
tethers
.
Dean
came
rushing
up
.
``
Are
you
hit
''
?
?
He
demanded
.
``
No
,
but
the
fat's
in
the
fire
''
!
!
Mike
said
.
``
There's
no
chance
now
of
all
of
us
getting
away
.
You'll
have
to
try
it
alone
''
.
The
sentry's
saddled
horse
stood
picketed
nearby
,
having
been
kept
handy
in
case
of
need
.
Mike
took
the
bayonet
from
Dean's
hand
and
slashed
the
picket
line
.
``
Up
you
go
''
!
!
He
said
.
``
Ride
''
!
!
Dean
resisted
Mike's
attempt
to
push
him
toward
the
horse
.
``
Why
not
you
''
?
?
He
protested
.
``
Dammit
''
!
!
Mike
said
frantically
.
``
You're
lighter
than
me
.
It's
our
only
chance
now
.
Try
to
find
these
Feds
.
The
rest
of
us
can
fort
up
in
the
house
and
hang
on
until
you
get
back
.
You're
the
one
that's
taking
the
big
chance
''
.
Dean
still
hesitated
,
but
Mike
lifted
him
almost
bodily
into
the
saddle
and
thrust
the
reins
in
his
hand
.
``
No
telling
how
good
this
horse
is
''
,
Mike
panted
.
``
Favor
him
and
save
something
in
case
you
hit
trouble
.
Watch
out
for
Apaches
when
it
comes
daylight
.
Take
the
pistol
.
You
might
need
it
.
We'll
still
have
the
rifle
,
and
I
might
be
able
to
round
up
some
more
.
I'll
stampede
the
rest
of
these
horses
so
they
can't
chase
you
''
.
Dean
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
gave
him
a
mighty
whack
on
the
back
.
``
McLish
''
,
he
said
as
he
kicked
the
horse
into
motion
,
``
I'd
be
a
mighty
sad
man
if
we
never
met
again
''
.
Then
he
was
on
his
way
at
a
gallop
.
Mike
ran
down
the
line
,
slashing
picket
ropes
with
the
bayonet
.
He
lifted
a
screeching
war
whoop
.
That
touched
off
a
total
stampede
.
He
darted
inside
the
stockade
and
freed
the
horses
there
.
These
poured
through
the
gate
and
joined
the
flight
.
The
animals
thundered
away
into
the
moonlight
,
heading
for
the
ridges
.
The
guerrillas
were
swarming
from
their
bivouac
at
the
west
end
of
the
enclosure
.
``
Apaches
''
!
!
Mike
yelled
.
``
They're
stealin'
the
stock
''
!
!
He
scuttled
in
shadow
along
the
east
wall
of
the
stockade
and
then
followed
the
south
wall
until
he
was
at
the
rear
of
the
two
frame
buildings
.
He
crouched
there
.
His
shout
had
been
taken
up
and
repeated
.
The
guerrillas
were
running
across
the
parade
ground
and
through
the
rear
gate
in
the
wake
of
the
departing
horses
.
All
were
carrying
guns
they
had
seized
up
,
but
they
were
half-clad
or
hardly
clad
at
all
.
Durkin
and
Calhoun
came
running
from
the
post
.
They
had
pistols
in
their
hands
.
They
bawled
questions
that
were
not
answered
in
the
uproar
.
They
followed
the
others
toward
the
east
gate
.
Beyond
the
stockade
rifles
began
to
explode
as
some
of
the
guerrillas
fired
at
shadows
that
they
imagined
were
Apaches
.
Mike
made
a
dash
to
the
rear
of
the
frame
buildings
.
He
crawled
beneath
the
two
supply
wagons
which
stood
between
the
buildings
and
peered
around
a
corner
.
The
area
was
deserted
.
A
man
was
standing
in
the
open
door
of
the
lighted
orderly
room
a
few
yards
to
Mike's
left
,
but
he
,
too
,
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
and
went
racing
to
join
the
confused
activity
at
the
east
end
of
the
stockade
.
Mike
crawled
to
the
door
and
peered
in
.
The
orderly
room
seemed
to
be
deserted
.
A
lantern
hung
from
a
peg
,
giving
light
.
Ducking
inside
,
he
found
that
three
rifles
were
stacked
in
a
corner
.
A
brace
of
pistols
,
holstered
on
belts
,
hung
from
a
peg
,
along
with
ammunition
pouches
.
An
ammunition
case
stood
open
,
containing
canisters
which
contained
powder
cartridges
.
Mike
seized
a
blanket
from
a
pallet
in
a
corner
,
spread
it
on
the
floor
and
used
it
to
form
a
bag
in
which
he
placed
his
booty
.
Shouldering
the
load
he
peered
from
the
door
.
His
looting
of
the
orderly
room
had
taken
only
a
minute
or
two
and
the
vicinity
was
still
clear
of
guerrillas
.
He
looked
at
the
looming
hoods
of
the
supply
wagons
,
struck
by
a
new
inspiration
.
He
set
his
bundle
down
.
Snatching
the
lantern
from
its
peg
,
he
shattered
its
globe
with
a
blow
against
a
post
.
He
picked
up
the
powder
canister
and
ran
out
.
Bursting
paper
cartridges
,
he
scattered
powder
beneath
the
nearest
wagon
and
dumped
the
contents
of
the
canister
upon
it
.
He
shouldered
the
blanket
again
,
backed
off
,
and
tossed
the
lantern
with
its
open
wick
beneath
the
wagon
.
He
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade
ground
toward
the
rock
house
.
Powder
flame
gushed
beneath
the
wagon
.
The
stockade
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
guerrillas
sighted
him
.
They
realized
the
truth
.
Bullets
began
to
snap
past
him
.
One
struck
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
rifles
that
projected
from
the
shoulder
pack
.
Its
force
spun
him
around
,
but
he
recovered
and
got
into
stride
again
.
A
bullet
tore
the
earth
from
beneath
his
foot
when
he
was
a
stride
or
two
from
safety
.
Another
struck
him
heavily
in
the
thigh
and
he
went
down
.
Guerrillas
were
racing
toward
him
.
Susan
and
Julia
came
from
the
door
and
dragged
him
with
them
.
The
three
of
them
floundered
through
the
door
into
the
interior
and
fell
in
a
heap
.
Susan
bounced
to
her
feet
and
slammed
the
door
.
She
crouched
aside
as
bullets
beat
at
the
portal
,
chewing
into
the
planks
.
Some
tore
entirely
through
the
whipsawed
post
oak
.
The
iron
hinges
held
,
but
the
planks
were
in
danger
of
being
torn
from
the
crossbars
.
Mike
rolled
to
Susan
,
grasped
her
around
the
knees
,
dragging
her
off
her
feet
.
He
hovered
over
her
to
shield
her
,
for
spent
bullets
were
thudding
against
the
rear
walls
.
He
peered
from
a
loophole
.
Guerrillas
were
only
a
dozen
yards
away
,
charging
the
house
.
Mike
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
heap
of
scattered
booty
and
fired
.
He
dropped
a
man
with
the
first
bullet
.
At
the
same
moment
Wheeler
Fiske
fired
the
rifle
Mike
had
given
him
and
another
guerrilla
was
hit
.
That
halted
the
rush
.
The
guerrillas
scattered
for
cover
.
The
wagons
were
burning
fiercely
.
The
mudwagon
had
caught
fire
also
.
The
blaze
was
spreading
to
the
frame
buildings
.
The
guerrillas
realized
they
faced
a
new
problem
.
``
Gawdamighty
''
!
!
One
screeched
.
``
There
goes
our
grub
an'
ammunition
''
!
!
``
Get
a
bucket
line
going
''
!
!
Calhoun
shouted
.
``
Hurry
!
!
Hurry
''
!
!
The
guerrillas
began
a
frantic
search
for
pails
in
which
to
bring
water
from
the
spring
.
But
what
few
containers
they
found
were
inadequate
.
Many
of
them
,
in
increasing
panic
,
came
running
with
water
in
their
hats
in
a
ludicrous
effort
.
Both
buildings
were
in
flames
.
The
heat
drove
the
guerrillas
back
.
The
roof
of
the
command
post
began
to
buckle
.
``
Drag
the
wagons
to
the
spring
''
!
!
Lew
Durkin
yelled
.
``
Run
'em
right
into
the
spring
!
!
Hustle
''
!
!
One
of
the
wagons
erupted
a
massive
pillar
of
flame
.
A
sizable
supply
of
powder
had
been
touched
off
.
The
wagons
and
the
coach
were
beyond
saving
and
so
were
the
buildings
.
The
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
,
giving
light
enough
to
examine
Mike's
wound
.
The
bullet
had
torn
through
the
flesh
just
above
the
knee
,
inflicting
an
ugly
gash
that
was
forming
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
.
But
it
had
missed
the
bone
and
had
passed
on
through
.
Susan
and
Julia
ripped
strips
from
their
clothing
and
bound
the
injury
.
Mike
tested
the
leg
and
found
that
he
was
able
to
hobble
around
on
it
.
``
So
it
wasn't
the
earthquake
that
made
him
return
to
his
village
''
!
!
``
No
.
Now
dammit
,
I
don't
want
to
go
into
any
more
explanations
.
Here
comes
Jason
.
Keep
this
to
yourself
''
.
Reverend
Jason
,
looking
worried
,
hurried
toward
us
.
``
Anything
wrong
,
cap'n
?
?
The
men
seem
to
think
so
''
.
``
Dirion
found
a
large
war
party
south
of
us
.
They'll
probably
attack
at
dawn
''
,
Montero
said
.
He
brushed
past
the
clergyman
and
walked
into
the
center
of
the
camp
.
Using
his
hands
as
a
trumpet
he
shouted
,
``
Fort
up
!
!
Fort
up
!
!
There's
a
large
war
party
on
their
way
''
!
!
For
a
second
,
engages
,
cooks
,
voyageurs
appeared
struck
dumb
.
Then
Little
Billy
began
shouting
orders
to
round
up
the
ponies
and
fill
the
water
buckets
and
for
the
cooks
to
hurry
up
with
the
meal
.
They
all
flew
into
action
.
``
That
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
''
,
I
said
to
Oso
.
The
Aricaras
treated
us
like
friends
.
And
here
all
the
time
you
knew
the
Sioux
would
be
using
our
rifles
on
them
!
!
God
,
what
a
world
you
people
live
in
''
.
Oso
gave
me
an
unruffled
look
.
``
Old
Knife's
got
the
largest
war
party
ever
seen
on
the
river
''
,
he
said
calmly
.
``
What
would
you
have
done
in
Montero's
moccasins
?
?
Let
Old
Knife
come
up
and
kill
you
and
your
people
,
or
would
you
steer
him
on
someone
else
''
?
?
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Mr.
Manuel
did
that
in
the
war
.
That's
why
the
British
never
got
the
tribes
to
fight
for
the
King
.
Mr.
Manuel
whispered
in
the
ears
of
the
Sioux
that
the
Cheyennes
were
comin'
to
raid
'em
for
their
horses
.
Then
he
went
on
to
the
Cheyennes
and
told
them
that
the
Sioux
was
goin'
to
move
up
.
He
did
that
with
all
the
Nations
.
Hell
,
they
were
fightin'
each
other
so
hard
they
had
no
time
for
anyone
else
.
The
War
Department
wrote
Mr.
Manuel
a
letter
and
said
he
was
a
hero
.
I
saw
that
letter
.
He
carried
it
in
a
little
wallet
made
of
fish
skin
''
.
``
But
that
was
war
''
,
I
said
.
``
There's
no
war
on
now
''
.
``
You're
wrong
,
Matt
.
In
this
country
there's
a
war
on
every
time
the
grass
turns
green
.
First
it
was
the
Nations
against
themselves
,
then
it
was
them
against
the
whites
.
And
it's
goin'
to
go
on
like
this
year
after
year
until
the
white
people
take
over
this
land
''
.
I
remember
being
told
it
would
happen
so
fast
people
would
think
it
took
place
overnight
.
``
That's
why
this
company's
important
.
Once
we
get
over
the
mountains
others
will
come
along
.
That's
why
the
Trust
don't
want
us
to
make
it
.
That
bastard
Chambers
!
!
--
Old
Knife's
not
the
only
chief
he'll
get
to
do
his
dirty
work
!
!
Before
we
get
through
he'll
have
the
Blackfeet
hankerin'
for
our
hair
and
our
goods
.
Well
,
talkin'
ain't
goin'
to
help
--
let's
fort
up
''
!
!
As
I
dug
in
behind
one
of
the
bales
we
were
using
as
protection
,
I
grudgingly
found
myself
agreeing
with
Oso's
logic
,
especially
when
I
imagined
what
would
have
happened
to
Missy
if
Old
Knife's
large
party
of
screeching
warriors
had
overrun
our
company
.
For
,
unlike
the
Sioux
and
the
Crows
,
the
Aricaras
are
not
great
horsemen
,
nor
are
they
aggressive
like
the
savage
Blackfeet
.
More
of
an
agricultural
nation
,
they
have
relied
on
their
warriors
only
for
defense
and
for
survival
in
the
endless
wars
of
the
plains
.
Still
,
I
was
disgusted
with
myself
for
agreeing
with
Montero's
methods
.
Surprisingly
,
he
had
told
the
others
what
he
had
done
.
In
the
brief
moment
I
had
to
talk
to
them
before
I
took
my
post
on
the
ring
of
defenses
,
I
indicated
I
was
sickened
by
the
methods
men
employed
to
live
and
trade
on
the
river
.
``
I
think
Montero
did
right
''
,
Amy
said
firmly
.
``
Let
the
savages
kill
each
other
.
What
do
we
care
''
?
?
Reverend
Jason
was
understandably
bitter
.
``
It
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
.
Those
little
children
.
''
But
Oso
replied
calmly
,
``
Trouble
ain't
easy
to
dodge
out
in
this
country
,
rev'rend
''
.
28
.
Attack
Gray
Eyes
attacked
our
camp
just
as
the
first
pink
threads
stitched
together
the
hills
and
the
sky
.
Our
camp
was
in
the
center
of
a
wide
valley
.
Montero
had
set
up
a
strong
position
,
using
every
bale
and
box
we
had
in
addition
to
barricades
of
logs
and
brush
.
He
had
ordered
the
ponies
brought
inside
the
fortified
circle
and
had
assigned
Pierre
and
a
band
of
picked
engages
the
job
of
trying
to
keep
them
steady
under
fire
.
The
pony
herd
was
the
one
flaw
in
our
defense
;
;
the
Rees
undoubtedly
would
try
to
cut
down
as
many
of
the
animals
as
possible
.
Wildly
bucking
horses
would
make
the
position
difficult
to
defend
against
charging
warriors
.
The
cooks
had
prepared
one
of
the
best
meals
we'd
had
in
a
long
time
,
and
on
Montero's
orders
had
baked
enough
bread
to
last
the
day
.
Buckets
were
filled
,
the
herd
fed
and
watered
.
The
worst
part
had
been
the
waiting
;
;
although
we
didn't
expect
the
attack
before
dawn
,
the
long
cloudy
night
,
filled
with
the
sounds
of
the
industrious
insects
,
seemed
endless
.
Coyotes
and
hunting
wolves
sounded
like
signaling
Indian
scouts
,
the
whinny
of
a
restless
pony
made
one's
skin
crawl
.
Oso
slept
unconcernedly
,
his
rifle
cradled
in
his
arms
;
;
I
didn't
catch
a
wink
.
Every
time
I
closed
my
eyes
,
I
saw
Gray
Eyes
rushing
at
me
with
a
knife
.
It
was
a
relief
when
they
finally
came
.
They
poured
through
the
opening
in
the
valley
,
then
spread
out
in
a
long
line
to
come
at
us
,
brandishing
their
lances
and
filling
the
morning
with
their
spine-chilling
scalp
cry
.
``
Oso
''
,
Montero
called
``
I'll
get
Gray
Eyes
''
.
``
That'll
be
a
pleasure
to
see
''
,
the
big
black
murmured
as
he
stared
down
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
.
``
Hold
your
fire
''
,
Montero
was
shouting
.
``
Wait
until
my
shot
.
I'll
shoot
the
first
man
who
doesn't
''
.
I
could
see
them
in
my
sights
.
They
were
about
a
mile
off
;
;
under
me
the
ground
quivered
slightly
.
At
first
they
were
only
feathers
and
dark
indistinguishable
faces
and
bodies
,
hunched
over
their
horses'
heads
.
Gradually
they
emerged
as
men
.
Gray
Eyes
was
in
the
lead
.
His
face
was
split
by
a
vermilion
streak
,
his
eyes
were
pools
of
white
;
;
jagged
red
and
black
medicine
symbols
covered
his
chest
.
He
was
naked
except
for
a
clout
.
Next
to
him
was
a
young
boy
I
was
sure
had
sat
near
me
at
one
of
the
trading
sessions
.
His
mouth
was
open
,
his
neck
corded
with
the
strain
of
his
screams
.
I
found
his
chest
in
my
sights
.
It
had
a
red
circle
.
The
circle
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
My
God
,
how
long
is
he
going
to
wait
,
I
thought
.
Montero's
rifle
cracked
.
At
first
I
thought
he
had
missed
.
Gray
Eyes
remained
erect
.
The
feathered
lance
was
still
above
his
head
.
As
he
started
to
slump
over
,
another
warrior
swung
him
onto
his
horse
.
I
squeezed
the
trigger
.
At
the
last
second
I
dropped
my
sights
from
the
bare
chest
and
bright
red
circle
to
the
chest
of
his
pony
.
I
saw
the
pony
fall
like
a
stone
and
the
young
warrior
flew
over
its
head
,
bouncing
like
a
rubber
ball
.
He
started
to
run
but
Oso's
shot
caught
him
on
the
wing
.
He
jerked
once
in
the
grass
and
lay
still
.
``
If
you're
goin'
to
kill
'em
--
!
!
Kill
'em
''
!
!
Oso
growled
.
What
else
he
said
was
lost
in
the
rattle
of
gunfire
on
all
sides
.
The
Aricaras
broke
under
the
devastating
fire
,
wheeled
and
retreated
.
``
Lead
up
!
!
Lead
up
!
!
They'll
be
back
''
!
!
Montero
was
shouting
.
Far
up
the
valley
I
could
see
the
Rees
circling
and
reorganizing
.
Out
in
front
of
our
walls
the
grass
was
covered
with
dead
and
dying
men
,
war
shields
,
lances
,
blankets
and
wounded
and
dead
horses
.
The
morning
air
was
filled
with
the
sweetish
odor
of
new-spilled
blood
,
the
acrid
stench
of
frightened
horses
,
and
the
bitterness
of
burned
powder
.
A
horse
screamed
as
it
twisted
from
side
to
side
in
a
frenzy
.
A
rifle
cracked
;
;
the
square
head
fell
over
.
One
of
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
began
running
across
the
valley
to
the
trees
that
lined
the
small
creek
.
His
legs
pumped
furiously
,
his
long
black
hair
streamed
out
behind
him
.
There
was
a
ragged
volley
.
He
was
dead
before
he
hit
the
ground
.
``
For
Christ's
sake
,
don't
waste
your
powder
on
one
of
'em
''
!
!
Montero
shouted
furiously
.
``
Wait
for
the
charge
!
!
The
charge
,
I
tell
you
''
!
!
The
sharp
cries
at
the
end
of
the
valley
were
faint
.
They
grew
louder
as
the
Indians
charged
again
.
I
could
see
their
faces
glistening
with
sweat
and
bear
grease
,
their
mouths
open
,
shouting
their
spine-chilling
cries
.
``
Gray
Eyes
is
back
,
,
Montero
said
.
The
war
captain
had
been
badly
wounded
and
was
fighting
to
hold
his
seat
.
I
could
see
the
blood
running
down
his
chest
.
He
was
riding
between
two
warriors
,
who
held
him
erect
when
he
started
to
slump
.
I
forgot
to
aim
.
In
my
sights
I
watched
him
looming
bigger
and
bigger
.
Montero's
shot
had
caught
him
high
in
the
chest
;
;
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
dying
.
Again
we
waited
for
Montero
.
This
time
he
delayed
so
long
that
some
of
the
engages
shouted
frantically
,
but
they
held
their
fire
.
The
horses
were
only
several
lengths
away
when
he
fired
.
The
bullet
flung
Gray
Eyes
from
his
horse
.
Our
rolling
volley
swept
most
of
the
other
riders
from
their
mounts
.
But
a
few
reached
our
wall
.
I
heard
the
whir
of
an
ax
and
a
Canadian's
face
burst
apart
in
a
bloody
spray
.
I
saw
Little
Billy
rise
and
fire
almost
point
blank
and
an
Indian's
face
became
shattered
flesh
and
bone
.
A
second
leaped
from
his
horse
to
the
top
of
the
bale
,
firing
four
arrows
in
such
rapid
succession
it
didn't
seem
possible
they
were
in
flight
.
Men
screamed
.
Oso
reached
up
,
jerked
the
buck
from
the
bale
and
snapped
his
neck
.
Other
Indians
were
running
at
the
ponies
,
shrilling
and
waving
blankets
.
Reverend
Jason
got
one
,
the
Canadians
the
others
.
I
saw
the
clergyman
kneel
for
a
moment
by
the
twitching
body
of
the
man
he
had
shot
,
then
run
back
to
his
position
.
The
ponies
were
almost
uncontrollable
.
The
pall
of
dust
they
raised
made
it
difficult
to
see
when
the
Aricaras
charged
again
.
This
time
more
of
them
hurdled
the
barrier
.
A
small
Indian
dived
at
Montero
,
who
caught
him
with
a
swift
upward
stroke
of
his
rifle
butt
.
It
sounded
like
a
man
kicking
a
melon
.
Above
me
a
dark
rider
was
whipping
his
pony
with
a
quirt
in
an
attempt
to
hurdle
the
bales
.
Although
my
shot
killed
his
horse
,
he
rolled
off
the
bale
on
top
of
me
.
I
could
smell
woodsmoke
,
grease
,
and
oil
.
His
eyes
were
dark
,
fluid
,
fearful
,
and
he
gave
a
sigh
as
my
knife
went
in
.
Coming
over
the
wall
he
had
seemed
like
a
hideous
devil
.
Now
under
me
I
could
see
him
for
what
he
really
was
,
a
boy
dressed
up
in
streaks
of
paint
.
The
Aricaras
made
one
last
desperate
charge
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
the
thin
ranks
of
warriors
,
old
and
young
,
wheeling
and
twisting
their
ponies
frantically
from
side
to
side
only
to
be
tumbled
bleeding
from
their
saddles
by
the
relentless
slam
,
slam
of
the
cruelly
efficient
Hawkinses
.
Others
,
badly
wounded
,
gripped
hands
in
manes
,
knees
in
bellies
,
held
on
as
long
as
possible
and
then
,
weak
from
ghastly
wounds
,
slipped
sideways
,
slowly
,
almost
thoughtfully
,
to
be
broken
under
the
slashing
hoofs
.
Some
gracefully
soared
from
the
backs
of
their
wounded
,
screaming
mounts
to
make
one
last
defiant
charge
before
the
lead
split
their
hearts
or
tore
their
guts
.
None
of
them
reached
our
walls
again
.
The
few
survivors
grudgingly
turned
away
.
In
the
distance
we
could
hear
the
drums
and
the
wail
of
the
death
song
.
She
was
carrying
a
quirt
,
and
she
started
to
raise
it
,
then
let
it
fall
again
and
dangle
from
her
wrist
.
``
I
saw
your
fire
''
,
she
said
,
speaking
slowly
,
making
an
effort
to
control
her
anger
.
``
You
could
burn
down
this
whole
mountainside
with
a
fire
that
size
.
It
wouldn't
matter
to
a
fool
like
you
.
It
would
to
me
''
.
``
All
right
''
,
Wilson
said
quickly
.
``
The
fire's
too
big
.
And
I
appreciate
the
advice
''
.
He
was
losing
patience
again
.
An
hour
before
,
with
the
children
asleep
and
nothing
but
the
strange
darkness
,
he
would
have
appreciated
company
.
She
had
helped
him
change
his
mind
.
``
I'm
not
advising
you
''
,
she
said
.
``
I'm
telling
you
.
That
fire's
too
big
.
Let
it
burn
down
.
And
make
sure
it's
out
when
you
leave
in
the
morning
''
.
He
was
taken
aback
.
It
took
him
a
long
time
to
compose
himself
.
``
There's
some
mistake
''
,
he
said
finally
.
``
You're
right
about
the
fire
.
It's
bigger
than
it
has
to
be
,
though
I
don't
see
where
it's
doing
any
harm
.
But
you're
wrong
about
the
rest
of
it
.
I'm
not
leaving
in
the
morning
.
Why
should
I
?
?
I
own
the
place
''
.
She
showed
her
surprise
by
tightening
the
reins
and
moving
the
gelding
around
so
that
she
could
get
a
better
look
at
his
face
.
It
didn't
seem
to
tell
her
anything
.
She
glanced
around
the
clearing
,
taking
in
the
wagon
and
the
load
of
supplies
and
trappings
scattered
over
the
ground
,
the
two
kids
,
the
whiteface
bull
that
was
chewing
its
cud
just
within
the
far
reaches
of
the
firelight
.
She
studied
it
for
a
long
time
.
Then
she
turned
back
to
Wilson
and
smiled
,
and
he
wasn't
quite
sure
what
she
meant
by
it
.
``
You
own
this
place
''
?
?
She
said
,
and
her
tone
had
softened
until
it
was
almost
friendly
.
``
You
bought
it
''
?
?
``
From
a
man
in
St.
Louis
''
,
Wilson
said
.
``
Jake
Carwood
.
Maybe
you
know
him
''
.
The
girl
laughed
.
``
I
know
him
.
I
ought
to
.
My
father
ran
him
off
here
six
years
ago
''
.
Wilson
didn't
say
anything
.
He
stood
watching
the
girl
,
wondering
what
was
coming
next
.
She
had
picked
up
the
quirt
and
was
twirling
it
around
her
wrist
and
smiling
at
him
.
``
Carwood
didn't
tell
you
that
''
,
she
said
.
``
No
''
,
Wilson
said
.
``
But
it's
understandable
.
It's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
would
be
proud
of
.
And
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
.
He
sold
me
a
clear
title
.
I
have
it
with
me
,
right
here
.
If
you
want
to
see
''
--
``
Never
mind
''
,
she
said
sternly
.
``
It
wouldn't
matter
to
my
father
,
and
not
to
me
.
I
meant
what
I
said
about
that
fire
.
Be
sure
it's
out
when
you
leave
.
That's
all
.
I'll
let
you
go
back
to
doing
the
dishes
now
''
.
It
was
meant
to
insult
him
,
and
didn't
quite
succeed
.
He
took
the
reins
just
below
the
bit
and
held
them
firmly
,
and
it
was
his
turn
to
smile
now
.
``
I
don't
mind
washing
dishes
now
and
then
''
,
he
said
pleasantly
.
``
It
doesn't
hurt
.
It
might
hurt
you
,
though
.
Somebody
might
mistake
you
for
a
woman
''
.
He
meant
to
say
more
,
but
he
never
got
the
chance
.
She
was
quick
.
She
brought
the
quirt
down
,
slashing
it
across
his
cheek
,
and
he
tried
to
step
back
.
She
swung
the
quirt
again
,
and
this
time
he
caught
her
wrist
and
pulled
her
out
of
the
saddle
.
She
came
down
against
him
,
and
he
tried
to
break
her
fall
.
He
grabbed
her
by
the
shoulders
and
went
down
on
one
knee
,
taking
her
weight
so
that
some
of
the
wind
was
driven
out
of
him
.
It
made
him
a
little
sick
,
and
he
let
go
of
her
.
He
got
up
slowly
,
and
she
was
already
on
her
feet
,
and
he
stood
facing
her
.
He
wiped
the
blood
from
his
cheek
.
``
I
ought
to
''
--
he
said
.
He
was
shaking
with
anger
,
his
breath
coming
in
long
,
painful
gasps
.
``
That
quirt
--
I
ought
to
use
it
on
you
,
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
.
If
you
were
a
man
''
--
``
She
isn't
,
mister
''
.
The
voice
came
from
behind
him
,
and
Wilson
turned
.
The
fire
had
gone
down
,
and
the
man
was
only
a
shadow
against
the
trees
.
But
a
moment
later
he
brought
his
horse
forward
into
the
light
,
and
Wilson
had
a
good
look
at
him
.
He
was
tall
and
dark-skinned
,
a
half-breed
,
Wilson
thought
.
And
he
was
handsome
,
despite
the
long
thin
scar
that
slanted
across
his
cheek
.
``
She's
not
a
man
,
mister
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
am
.
If
you've
got
any
ideas
''
.
He
raised
the
Winchester
and
pointed
it
at
Wilson's
chest
.
``
Put
the
rifle
down
,
Joseph
''
,
the
girl
said
.
She
seemed
irritated
.
``
I
thought
I
told
you
to
stay
home
''
.
The
half-breed
eased
the
Winchester
down
and
rested
it
across
his
lap
.
The
scar
looked
pure
white
in
the
half-darkness
;
;
his
eyes
were
black
and
deep-set
,
and
expressionless
.
``
You
shouldn't
be
riding
up
here
after
dark
,
Judith
''
,
he
said
quietly
.
``
I
can
take
care
of
this
.
It's
no
job
for
you
''
.
The
girl
tapped
the
quirt
impatiently
against
her
knee
and
glared
at
him
.
He
took
it
without
flinching
.
``
I
said
go
home
,
Joseph
.
You've
got
no
business
up
here
''
.
The
half-breed
didn't
answer
this
time
.
But
the
scar
seemed
to
pull
hard
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
eyes
were
hurt
and
angry
.
It
made
Wilson
wonder
.
He
watched
the
half-breed
as
he
turned
silently
.
They
could
hear
the
pony's
feet
on
the
dry
leaves
for
a
while
,
then
the
sound
faded
out
.
Wilson
brushed
the
dust
from
his
coat
.
``
Who
was
that
''
?
?
He
asked
.
``
Your
personal
guard
?
?
You're
pretty
hard
on
him
''
.
``
He
works
for
my
father
''
,
the
girl
said
,
and
then
seemed
to
change
her
mind
.
``
He's
a
friend
.
His
name's
Joseph
Sanchez
.
Is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
''
?
?
``
Not
now
''
,
Wilson
said
.
``
I
guess
I'll
find
out
soon
enough
.
You've
got
blood
on
your
cheek
.
Not
yours
.
Mine
.
It
must
have
got
there
when
you
fell
against
me
''
.
She
wiped
it
off
with
the
sleeve
of
her
coat
.
``
I'll
bet
that's
as
close
as
you've
been
to
a
man
since
you
were
a
baby
''
,
Wilson
said
.
He
saw
her
hand
start
to
work
down
the
leather
thong
toward
the
handle
of
the
quirt
,
and
he
grabbed
her
wrist
.
``
Oh
,
no
''
,
he
said
,
and
he
was
without
humor
now
.
``
I've
had
enough
of
that
.
I've
had
enough
of
you
.
I
don't
know
what
goes
on
around
here
,
and
I
don't
care
.
I
don't
know
what
makes
you
think
you
can
get
away
with
this
kind
of
business
,
and
I
don't
care
about
that
,
either
.
You
took
me
by
surprise
.
But
I'll
know
how
to
handle
you
next
time
''
.
She
brought
up
her
free
hand
to
hit
him
,
but
this
time
he
was
quicker
.
He
side-stepped
her
blow
and
she
fell
,
stumbling
against
the
gelding
.
She
finally
regained
her
balance
and
got
up
in
the
saddle
.
Her
hat
had
come
off
and
fallen
behind
her
shoulders
,
held
by
the
string
,
and
he
could
see
her
face
more
clearly
than
he
had
at
any
time
before
.
He
had
forgotten
that
she
was
so
pretty
.
But
her
prettiness
was
what
he
had
noticed
first
,
and
all
the
other
things
had
come
afterward
:
cruelty
,
meanness
,
self-will
.
He
had
known
women
like
that
,
one
woman
in
particular
.
And
one
had
been
too
many
.
He
watched
the
girl
until
she
had
gone
into
the
trees
,
and
waited
until
he
couldn't
hear
the
sound
of
her
horse
any
longer
,
then
went
up
to
where
the
children
were
sleeping
.
They
weren't
sleeping
,
of
course
,
but
they
thought
they
were
doing
him
a
favor
by
pretending
.
He
hadn't
shown
up
too
well
in
their
eyes
,
letting
himself
be
browbeaten
by
a
woman
.
They
expected
greater
things
from
him
,
regardless
of
how
trying
the
circumstances
,
and
they
were
disappointed
.
And
determined
not
to
show
it
.
They
lay
a
little
too
stiffly
,
with
their
eyes
straining
to
stay
closed
.
``
Go
to
sleep
''
,
he
said
.
``
Both
of
you
.
There's
better
things
to
do
than
listen
to
something
like
that
.
I'll
be
down
at
the
creek
finishing
the
dishes
,
if
you
want
me
''
.
He
found
the
pan
where
he
had
dropped
it
and
carried
it
back
down
to
the
stream
.
The
coyote
was
calling
again
,
and
he
hoped
that
this
time
there
would
be
no
other
sounds
to
interrupt
it
.
Not
tonight
,
at
any
rate
.
He
had
a
feeling
that
the
girl
meant
trouble
.
If
she
did
,
he
could
stand
it
better
in
the
light
.
He
scrubbed
absent-mindedly
at
the
pans
and
reflected
on
how
things
had
turned
out
.
That
afternoon
when
they
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
broken-down
ranch
house
,
his
hopes
had
been
high
.
Already
some
of
the
pain
had
gone
from
Amelia's
death
.
Not
all
of
it
.
There
would
still
be
plenty
of
moments
of
regret
and
sadness
and
guilty
relief
.
But
they
were
starting
a
new
life
.
And
they
had
almost
everything
they
needed
:
land
,
a
house
,
two
whiteface
bulls
,
three
horses
.
The
land
wasn't
all
Wilson
had
expected
of
it
.
Six
hundred
and
forty
acres
,
the
old
man
back
in
St.
Louis
had
said
;
;
good
grass
,
good
water
.
Well
,
the
grass
was
there
,
though
in
some
places
the
ground
was
too
steep
for
a
cow
to
get
to
it
.
The
water
was
there
,
so
much
of
it
that
it
spread
all
through
the
dead
orchard
.
And
there
was
a
house
;
;
livable
perhaps
,
but
badly
in
need
of
repairs
.
In
the
last
analysis
,
though
,
Wilson
had
little
cause
to
complain
.
The
place
had
been
cheap
--
just
the
little
he
had
left
after
Amelia's
burial
--
and
it
would
serve
its
purpose
.
There
was
only
one
place
where
Jake
Carwood's
description
had
gone
badly
awry
:
the
peace
and
quiet
.
It
hadn't
started
out
that
way
.
And
he
had
a
feeling
--
thanks
to
the
girl
--
that
things
would
get
worse
before
they
got
better
.
2
They
had
the
house
cleaned
up
by
noon
,
and
Wilson
sent
the
boy
out
to
the
meadow
to
bring
in
the
horses
.
He
stood
on
the
porch
and
watched
him
struggling
with
the
heavy
harness
,
and
finally
went
over
to
help
him
.
Kathy
was
already
in
the
wagon
.
They
were
going
to
town
,
and
they
were
both
excited
.
Wilson
backed
the
team
into
the
traces
,
and
wished
they
weren't
going
to
town
at
all
.
He
had
an
uneasy
feeling
about
it
.
That
girl
last
night
,
what
was
her
name
?
?
Judith
Pierce
.
It
was
the
only
thing
about
her
that
was
the
least
bit
hard
to
remember
.
He
finished
with
the
team
and
filled
his
pipe
and
stood
looking
about
him
.
He
had
spent
two
hours
riding
around
the
ranch
that
morning
,
and
in
broad
daylight
it
was
even
less
inviting
than
Judith
Pierce
had
made
it
seem
.
There
was
brush
,
and
stands
of
pine
that
no
grass
could
grow
under
,
and
places
so
steep
that
cattle
wouldn't
stop
to
graze
.
But
there
was
water
.
There
was
an
artificial
lake
just
out
of
sight
in
the
first
stand
of
trees
,
fed
by
a
half
dozen
springs
that
popped
out
of
the
ground
above
the
hillside
orchard
.
Yes
,
there
was
plenty
of
water
,
too
much
,
and
that
was
probably
the
trouble
.
There
were
tracks
of
cattle
all
over
his
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
.
The
first
part
of
the
road
was
steep
,
but
it
leveled
off
after
the
second
bend
and
curled
gradually
into
the
valley
.
It
was
hotter
once
they
reached
the
flat
,
and
drier
,
but
the
grass
was
better
.
A
warm
breeze
played
across
it
,
moving
it
like
waves
.
A
red-tailed
hawk
flew
in
behind
them
and
stayed
there
,
watching
for
any
snakes
or
rabbits
that
they
might
stir
up
from
the
side
of
the
road
.
It
took
them
an
hour
before
they
came
to
the
first
houses
of
Kelseyville
.
The
town
was
about
what
Wilson
expected
:
one
main
street
with
its
rows
of
false-fronted
buildings
,
a
water
tower
,
a
few
warehouses
,
a
single
hotel
;
;
all
dusty
and
sunbaked
.
The
place
was
quiet
.
Such
was
my
state
of
mind
that
I
did
not
question
the
possibility
of
this
;
;
under
the
circumstances
I
was
only
too
willing
to
confess
all
.
I
was
nearly
thirty
at
the
time
.
I
went
to
the
hall
in
the
afternoons
only
,
on
these
preliminary
matters
.
It
was
dark
and
,
I
sensed
,
very
large
;
;
only
the
counter
at
one
end
was
lighted
by
a
long
fluorescent
tube
suspended
directly
above
it
.
Sometimes
I
was
aware
of
people
moving
about
in
the
darkness
.
I
would
turn
away
from
my
writing
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
good
look
at
them
but
I
never
quite
succeeded
.
A
glimpse
of
three
of
four
vague
figures
,
at
the
most
.
Drifting
here
and
there
.
Squatting
,
as
if
waiting
.
The
pulsing
glow
of
a
cigarette
.
Since
they
could
see
me
but
I
not
them
,
their
presence
in
the
hall
disturbed
me
.
The
clerk
paid
them
no
attention
.
This
impressed
me
,
until
I
realized
how
limited
was
his
sphere
of
influence
.
His
job
simply
consisted
in
registering
new
men
.
When
the
phone
rang
he
answered
it
.
His
authority
extended
to
the
far
edge
of
the
counter
,
no
further
.
None
of
the
men
hanging
around
the
hall
bothered
to
speak
to
him
.
Baldness
was
attacking
his
pate
.
He
spoke
to
me
in
a
gruff
voice
,
an
affectation
which
quite
belied
his
personality
.
He
wore
his
white
shirt
open
at
the
neck
,
revealing
a
bit
of
scrawny
pale
chest
underneath
.
It
was
obvious
that
he
wished
himself
different
from
the
sort
of
person
he
thought
he
was
.
But
it
was
not
easy
for
him
and
he
often
slipped
.
When
one
of
the
men
in
the
hall
behind
us
spat
on
the
floor
and
scraped
his
boot
over
the
gob
of
spittle
I
noticed
how
the
clerk
winced
.
I
felt
certain
he
was
really
a
spineless
little
man
.
His
hat
(
the
cause
of
his
baldness
?
?
)
hung
on
a
hook
on
the
wall
,
and
underneath
it
I
could
see
his
tie
,
knotted
,
ready
to
be
slipped
over
his
head
,
a
black
badge
of
frayed
respectability
that
ought
never
to
have
left
his
neck
.
The
morning's
tabloids
were
on
the
counter
,
and
a
stack
of
dog-eared
men's
magazines
.
On
a
shelf
in
the
office
behind
the
counter
was
a
small
radio
dialed
permanently
on
a
station
which
broadcast
only
vulgar
commercials
and
cheap
popular
music
.
Everything
about
the
clerk
was
trivial
.
Once
,
pressing
him
,
I
learned
that
his
job
was
only
part-time
,
in
the
afternoons
when
nothing
went
on
in
the
hall
.
Noticing
my
disappointment
he
attempted
to
salvage
what
scraps
and
shreds
of
authority
he
felt
might
still
be
clinging
to
his
person
.
With
distaste
I
saw
him
assume
a
pompous
air
.
When
he
saw
me
coming
he
turned
his
radio
off
.
He
made
a
show
of
rearranging
my
forms
on
the
shelf
.
He
would
pick
up
the
ringing
phone
with
studied
negligence
,
then
bark
into
it
with
gruff
importance
.
What
limited
knowledge
he
possessed
he
forced
upon
me
.
In
the
mornings
,
I
was
informed
,
fluorescent
tubes
,
similar
to
the
one
above
the
counter
,
illuminated
the
entire
hall
.
They
,
and
the
two
large
fans
which
I
could
dimly
see
as
daylight
filtered
through
their
vents
,
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
,
could
be
turned
on
by
a
master
switch
situated
inside
the
office
.
He
pointed
out
the
switch
to
me
and
for
a
moment
I
foolishly
believed
that
he
would
let
deed
follow
words
.
I
was
shown
,
instead
,
a
batch
of
white
tickets
of
the
sort
handed
out
,
he
told
me
,
every
morning
.
Now
,
here
was
something
of
obvious
importance
to
me
,
yet
when
I
reached
for
the
tickets
he
snatched
them
away
from
my
hand
.
He
couldn't
afford
to
have
anyone
mess
around
with
them
,
he
said
.
Each
of
those
tickets
was
of
great
value
to
its
rightful
recipient
.
I
withdrew
my
hand
.
Later
I
would
remember
what
this
pompous
little
man
had
told
me
about
the
worth
of
a
ticket
.
Having
nothing
else
to
do
except
wait
for
my
forms
to
be
processed
,
I
gave
myself
over
to
speculations
concerning
the
hall
itself
.
When
suitably
lighted
,
what
would
it
look
like
?
?
The
presence
of
the
two
exhaust
fans
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
hall
could
become
crowded
for
air
.
One
afternoon
,
upon
receiving
permission
and
the
necessary
instructions
from
the
clerk
,
I
had
visited
the
toilet
adjoining
the
hall
.
By
counting
the
number
of
stalls
and
urinals
I
attempted
to
form
a
loose
estimate
of
how
many
men
the
hall
would
hold
at
one
time
.
For
although
I
had
crossed
a
corner
of
the
hall
on
my
way
to
the
toilet
I
still
could
not
tell
for
sure
how
far
to
the
rear
the
darkness
extended
.
I
could
observe
the
two
fans
down
at
the
end
,
but
their
size
in
themselves
meant
nothing
to
me
as
long
as
I
had
no
measure
of
comparison
.
I
had
for
some
time
been
hoping
,
in
vain
,
for
one
of
the
dim
figures
to
pass
between
the
fan
vents
and
myself
.
I
knew
that
three
or
four
of
them
were
almost
always
present
in
the
hall
,
but
what
they
were
doing
,
and
exactly
where
,
I
could
not
tell
.
It
was
,
I
felt
,
possible
that
they
were
men
who
,
having
received
no
tickets
for
that
day
,
had
remained
in
the
hall
,
to
sleep
perhaps
,
in
the
corners
farthest
removed
from
the
counter
with
its
overhead
light
.
This
light
did
not
penetrate
very
far
back
into
the
hall
,
and
my
eyes
were
hindered
rather
than
aided
by
the
dim
daylight
entering
through
the
fan
vents
when
I
tried
to
pick
out
whatever
might
be
lying
,
or
squatting
,
on
the
floor
below
.
Also
the
clerk
appeared
to
disapprove
of
my
frequent
curious
glances
back
over
my
shoulder
.
No
sooner
would
I
turn
my
head
away
from
the
counter
before
he
would
address
me
,
at
times
quite
sharply
,
in
order
to
bring
back
my
attention
.
And
I
had
hardly
finished
my
business
in
the
toilet
on
the
aforementioned
occasion
when
the
lights
in
that
place
,
like
the
hall
lights
controlled
from
the
switch
in
the
office
,
flicked
off
and
on
impatiently
.
This
sort
of
petty
vigilance
annoyed
me
.
I
felt
certain
it
was
self-appointed
.
It
sprang
from
a
type
of
mentality
I'd
encountered
often
enough
but
certainly
had
not
expected
to
find
here
.
I
decided
to
see
no
more
of
the
clerk
until
the
processing
of
my
papers
was
completed
.
I
felt
strongly
attached
to
the
hall
,
however
,
and
hardly
a
day
passed
when
I
did
not
go
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
.
I
lived
in
a
state
of
suspense
because
of
it
.
I
could
not
cling
to
my
past
nor
did
I
wish
to
.
I
had
signed
it
off
on
the
forms
.
My
future
lay
solely
with
the
hall
,
yet
what
did
I
know
about
the
hall
at
this
point
?
?
Although
I
had
been
inside
it
I
had
not
yet
seen
it
functioning
.
I
wished
to
prepare
myself
but
did
not
even
know
what
sort
of
clothes
I
ought
to
be
wearing
.
I
did
not
despair
,
however
;
;
far
from
it
!
!
I
was
constantly
searching
for
clues
around
the
neighborhood
of
the
hall
.
Though
only
a
relatively
short
walk
separated
it
from
my
own
part
of
town
,
its
character
was
wholly
foreign
to
me
.
Large
warehouses
flanked
the
street
on
which
the
hall
fronted
.
The
river
was
only
a
few
blocks
away
but
an
unbroken
line
of
piers
prevented
me
from
seeing
it
.
Sometimes
I
noticed
the
tops
of
ships'
masts
and
funnels
reaching
above
the
pier
roofs
.
The
sounds
issuing
from
beyond
--
winches
whirring
,
men
shouting
--
indicated
great
activity
and
excited
me
.
The
hall
,
on
the
other
hand
,
appeared
lifeless
and
deserted
on
these
long
waterfront
afternoons
.
It
resembled
nothing
I'd
ever
seen
before
.
Its
front
was
windowless
,
but
irregularities
in
the
masonry
might
be
an
indication
that
windows
,
now
blinded
,
had
once
looked
out
upon
the
street
.
I
kept
circling
the
block
hoping
to
see
,
from
the
street
behind
it
,
the
rear
of
the
hall
.
But
it
was
not
a
tall
structure
and
other
buildings
concealed
it
.
For
weeks
I
wandered
about
this
neighborhood
of
warehouses
and
garages
,
truck
terminals
and
taxi
repair
shops
,
gasoline
pumps
and
longshoremen's
lunch
counters
,
yet
never
did
I
cease
to
feel
myself
a
stranger
there
.
I
returned
to
the
hall
,
despite
my
dislike
for
the
clerk
.
As
I
had
expected
,
he
insisted
that
my
visits
to
the
hall
would
do
nothing
to
further
the
process
of
my
application
.
Meanwhile
spring
had
passed
well
into
summer
.
At
last
,
when
I
put
it
to
him
directly
,
the
clerk
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
delay
in
my
case
was
unusual
.
When
I
asked
him
what
,
if
anything
,
I
could
do
about
it
,
he
surprised
me
by
referring
me
to
the
director
of
the
hall
.
I
could
consult
this
personage
on
any
weekday
morning
,
though
not
before
ten
o'clock
.
The
clerk
impressed
this
upon
me
:
that
I
should
not
arrive
in
the
hall
before
ten
o'clock
.
When
I
went
for
my
interview
with
the
director
I
saw
why
.
Although
it
was
dark
as
usual
I
could
see
that
the
hall
had
only
recently
contained
a
great
many
people
.
Cigarette
butts
littered
the
floor
.
The
big
fans
were
going
,
drawing
from
the
large
room
the
remnants
of
stale
smoke
which
drifted
about
in
pale
strata
underneath
the
ceiling
.
I
had
felt
the
draft
they
were
making
while
mounting
the
stairs
.
The
staircase
itself
seemed
still
to
be
echoing
the
heavy
footfalls
of
many
men
.
I
stopped
by
the
counter
.
No
one
was
behind
it
,
but
in
the
rear
wall
of
the
office
I
noticed
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
door
which
had
been
left
partially
open
.
Past
it
I
could
see
part
part
of
a
desk
,
a
flag
in
a
corner
,
a
rug
on
the
floor
.
The
director's
office
.
I
rapped
my
knuckles
on
the
counter
.
The
director
came
to
the
door
.
I
was
at
once
disappointed
,
although
just
what
I
had
expected
him
to
look
like
I
could
not
have
explained
.
He
was
a
man
in
his
late
forties
,
with
graying
hair
,
of
medium
height
;
;
he
looked
dapper
in
a
lightweight
summer
suit
,
brown
silk
tie
and
green-tinted
soft
collar
.
He
wore
perforated
,
white-topped
shoes
;
;
they
somehow
made
me
expect
to
see
him
launch
into
a
vaudeville
tapdance
routine
any
moment
.
But
he
came
toward
me
sedately
enough
,
showed
me
around
the
counter
,
offered
me
a
seat
inside
his
office
,
then
walked
to
a
file
cabinet
and
got
out
my
application
.
I
had
the
impression
that
he
had
read
my
forms
,
perhaps
several
times
.
He
did
not
look
at
them
now
.
As
he
lowered
himself
on
the
chair
behind
his
desk
I
wondered
what
this
dapper
,
slightly
ridiculous
man
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
the
workings
of
the
hall
.
He
spoke
,
in
a
voice
as
immaculate
as
his
appearance
.
Why
had
I
registered
?
?
Begging
my
pardon
,
he
must
express
his
astonishment
over
seeing
a
person
of
my
background
applying
at
the
hall
.
He
had
looked
over
my
forms
and
was
impressed
by
what
he
had
seen
there
;
;
indeed
,
my
scholastic
qualifications
were
such
that
he
,
a
college
graduate
himself
,
must
envy
me
them
.
Was
I
sure
,
he
asked
,
that
I
knew
what
I
was
applying
for
?
?
What
sort
of
men
I
would
come
into
contact
with
,
at
the
hall
?
?
These
questions
did
not
surprise
me
;
;
I
felt
certain
that
the
director
,
like
the
afternoon
clerk
,
seldom
moved
beyond
the
counter
,
that
the
hall
,
to
them
,
was
a
jungle
,
a
dark
and
unwelcome
place
.
Though
I
doubted
that
he
would
understand
me
,
I
told
the
director
my
motives
for
applying
.
I
had
always
,
I
said
,
hankered
after
working
hard
with
my
hands
.
This
desire
,
I
went
on
,
growing
voluble
as
my
conviction
was
aroused
,
had
mounted
at
such
a
rate
recently
that
I
now
found
its
realization
necessary
not
only
to
my
physical
but
also
to
my
spiritual
wellbeing
.
To
this
effect
I
had
already
severed
all
connections
which
bound
me
to
my
former
existence
.
The
flat
,
hard
cap
was
small
,
but
he
thrust
it
to
the
back
of
his
head
.
``
Tie
him
up
''
.
``
Hell
with
it
''
.
Before
they
could
guess
his
intention
Rankin
stepped
forward
and
swung
the
guard's
own
gun
against
the
uncovered
head
,
hard
.
The
man
went
over
without
sound
,
falling
to
the
bare
floor
.
Barton
said
harshly
,
``
Why
did
you
do
that
''
?
?
Rankin
sneered
at
him
.
``
What
did
you
want
me
to
do
,
kiss
him
?
?
He
dumped
me
in
solitary
twice
''
.
Barton
caught
the
lighter
man's
shoulder
and
swung
him
around
.
``
Let's
get
one
thing
straight
,
you
and
me
.
The
only
reason
we
brought
you
was
to
get
Miller
out
.
If
you
ever
try
anything
without
my
orders
I'll
kill
you
''
.
Fred
Rankin
looked
at
him
.
It
seemed
to
Barton
that
the
green
eyes
mocked
him
,
the
thin-lipped
smile
held
insolence
,
but
he
had
no
time
to
waste
now
.
``
Come
on
.
Let's
move
''
.
They
filed
out
through
the
guard-room
door
,
into
the
paved
square
.
There
were
three
other
men
within
this
prison
whom
Barton
would
have
liked
to
liberate
,
but
they
were
in
other
cell
blocks
.
There
was
no
chance
.
They
moved
slowly
,
toward
the
main
gate
,
following
the
wall
.
There
was
no
moon
.
They
had
chosen
this
night
purposely
.
They
reached
the
guard
house
without
alerting
the
men
on
the
walls
above
,
and
Powers
slipped
through
the
door
.
Two
men
were
on
duty
inside
,
playing
pinochle
,
relaxed
.
They
looked
up
in
surprise
as
Powers
came
in
.
``
What
are
you
doing
out
of
the
block
''
?
?
``
It's
Curtiss
''
,
he
said
,
naming
the
man
Rankin
had
hit
.
``
I've
got
to
have
help
''
.
They
stared
at
him
.
The
sergeant
in
charge
climbed
to
his
feet
.
``
What's
wrong
with
him
''
?
?
``
He's
having
some
kind
of
a
fit
''
.
The
sergeant
turned
to
the
door
.
As
he
passed
through
it
Barton
shoved
his
gun
against
the
man's
side
.
``
One
sound
and
you're
dead
''
.
The
sergeant
froze
.
Powers
had
not
followed
.
Powers
was
covering
the
remaining
guard
.
The
man
half-reached
for
the
cord
of
the
alarm
bell
.
Powers
knocked
his
arm
aside
.
Deliberately
,
with
none
of
Rankin's
viciousness
,
he
laid
the
barrel
of
his
gun
alongside
the
guard's
head
.
They
were
free
.
Even
Barton
could
not
quite
believe
it
.
It
had
gone
without
a
hitch
.
They
slid
through
the
wicket
in
the
big
gate
,
ghosted
across
the
dark
ground
.
Five
minutes
later
they
reached
the
horses
.
Barton
was
relieved
to
see
that
Carl
Dill
and
Emmett
Foster
had
brought
extra
mounts
.
He
had
been
worried
that
with
Miller
and
Rankin
added
to
the
escape
party
they
would
be
short
.
No
one
hurried
.
They
walked
the
horses
,
heading
along
the
river
,
Barton
and
Emmett
Foster
in
the
lead
,
seven
men
riding
quietly
through
the
night
.
The
only
thing
which
would
have
attracted
attention
was
that
two
wore
the
uniform
of
prison
guards
,
three
the
striped
suits
of
convicts
.
Five
miles
.
In
a
small
grove
against
the
river
they
halted
,
turning
deep
into
the
protection
of
the
trees
.
Foster
had
brought
extra
clothing
also
.
A
good
man
,
Emmett
.
He
had
been
one
of
the
original
Night
Riders
,
one
who
had
escaped
the
trial
.
It
was
to
him
that
Barton
had
sent
Carl
Dill
on
Dill's
release
from
the
prison
.
Clyde
Miller
was
crying
softly
to
himself
,
shedding
his
striped
suit
and
fumbling
into
the
nondescript
butternut
pants
,
the
worn
brown
shirt
.
Kid
Boyd
was
unusually
silent
,
Rankin
watchful
,
a
few
paces
apart
.
Barton
finished
his
dressing
and
extended
his
hand
to
Powers
.
``
I
won't
even
try
to
thank
you
''
.
The
ex-prison
guard
was
embarrassed
.
He
said
in
a
studied
voice
,
``
I
didn't
do
it
for
you
.
I
did
it
for
the
valley
.
You're
the
only
man
the
Night
Riders
will
follow
.
We've
been
starving
and
I
don't
like
to
starve
''
.
Barton
turned
away
,
his
eyes
falling
upon
Rankin
beside
his
horse
.
``
Good
luck
''
.
The
murderer
lifted
his
head
.
``
Meaning
you
want
me
to
ride
out
''
?
?
``
You
aren't
one
of
us
.
There's
nothing
for
you
here
''
.
``
I
got
no
place
to
go
''
.
Barton
hesitated
.
He
did
not
trust
Rankin
,
his
violent
temper
,
his
killer
instinct
.
But
ten
years
in
prison
had
taught
him
realities
.
They
were
in
a
fight
,
outweighed
in
both
numbers
and
money
.
It
was
all
right
to
put
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
,
to
call
them
Night
Riders
,
to
set
out
to
attack
the
largest
mining
combination
the
country
had
ever
seen
if
all
they
wanted
was
adventure
.
But
if
they
really
hoped
to
succeed
they
needed
professionals
,
men
who
knew
how
to
use
a
gun
against
men
,
who
would
match
the
killers
on
the
other
side
.
``
Your
choice
''
,
he
said
briefly
,
and
turned
to
Kid
Boyd
.
``
Bury
those
uniforms
so
they
won't
be
found
''
.
Then
Barton
touched
Carl
Dill's
arm
and
moved
off
,
up
the
river
bank
.
He
wanted
a
careful
,
uninterrupted
report
from
Dill
on
the
conditions
in
the
valley
.
They
squatted
on
their
heels
in
the
deep
mud
and
Dill
found
a
cigar
in
his
breast
pocket
,
passing
it
over
silently
.
He
too
knew
the
agony
of
going
for
weeks
,
sometimes
months
without
the
solace
of
tobacco
.
Mitchell
Barton
drew
in
the
fragrance
deeply
,
letting
the
smoke
lie
warm
and
soothing
in
his
throat
for
a
moment
before
he
exhaled
.
Through
the
gloom
he
could
not
see
the
man
beside
him
clearly
but
he
knew
him
thoroughly
.
For
his
first
five
years
in
prison
,
they
had
shared
a
cell
.
Carl
Dill
was
neither
a
rancher
nor
a
valley
man
.
He
had
been
the
auditor
for
the
mining
syndicate
,
and
he
had
stolen
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
the
syndicate's
money
.
He
had
done
time
for
the
theft
.
The
one
thing
they
had
in
common
was
their
hatred
.
Both
hated
Donald
Kruger
.
It
had
drawn
them
together
,
and
since
his
release
from
prison
Dill
had
worked
tirelessly
to
effect
this
night's
escape
.
He
said
now
,
``
I've
got
the
perfect
headquarters
set
up
.
The
old
Haskell
mine
''
.
Mitch
Barton
knew
the
place
.
Twenty
years
before
a
group
of
Easterners
had
bought
out
the
Haskell
claims
in
the
rocky
hills
south
of
Grass
Valley
.
They
had
spent
a
million
dollars
,
carving
in
a
road
,
putting
up
buildings
,
drilling
their
haulage
tunnel
.
Then
the
vein
had
petered
out
and
the
whole
project
had
been
abandoned
.
``
The
road's
washed
badly
''
,
said
Dill
,
``
but
there's
a
trail
you
can
get
over
with
a
horse
.
A
company
of
cavalry
couldn't
come
in
there
if
two
men
were
guarding
that
trail
''
.
Barton
nodded
.
``
How
do
the
valley
people
feel
''
?
?
``
As
mad
as
ever
.
But
Kruger's
men
keep
them
off
balance
,
and
they
don't
trust
me
.
I'm
an
outsider
.
When
they
learn
you're
in
the
hills
though
,
they'll
rally
,
don't
worry
about
that
''
.
Barton
waited
for
a
long
moment
,
then
asked
the
question
which
lay
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
``
My
boy
.
Did
you
find
him
''
?
?
Dill
was
silent
as
if
he
hated
to
answer
,
and
Barton
had
a
cold
,
sick
feeling
of
apprehension
.
``
He's
in
Morgan's
Ferry
''
.
Barton
half-straightened
in
surprise
.
``
What's
he
doing
there
''
?
?
Again
Dill
hesitated
.
``
Dealing
faro
''
.
``
Dealing
faro
?
?
How
come
''
?
?
``
Your
sister-in-law
has
the
faro
bank
in
Cap
Ayres'
saloon
''
.
Barton
cursed
under
his
breath
.
After
another
long
pause
he
asked
,
``
How
many
people
know
who
they
are
''
?
?
``
Everyone
.
Your
cousin
Finley
saw
to
that
.
He's
quite
a
rat
,
you
know
.
He
sold
out
to
Kruger's
men
.
He's
informed
them
of
everything
you've
ever
written
him
.
He
wants
your
ranch
''
.
Barton
stood
up
.
He
said
tensely
,
``
All
right
.
Let's
go
get
the
boy
''
.
Dill
had
come
up
also
.
``
I
was
afraid
of
this
.
I
almost
didn't
tell
you
''
.
``
If
you
hadn't
I'd
have
killed
you
''
.
Dill's
voice
tightened
.
``
But
you
can't
ride
into
the
Ferry
.
That's
what
they'll
expect
you
to
do
.
They'll
be
there
waiting
for
you
.
I
understand
how
you
feel
about
the
child
.
''
``
The
hell
you
do
''
.
Barton's
voice
was
rougher
than
Dill
had
ever
heard
it
.
``
I
never
saw
him
.
My
wife
died
in
childbirth
after
I
was
sent
away
.
``
I
can't
leave
him
there
.
Donald
Kruger
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
hold
him
as
hostage
,
and
I
wouldn't
entrust
a
snake
to
his
tender
care
.
I've
got
to
get
the
boy
.
Let's
ride
''
.
Chapter
two
Barton's
men
cut
the
telegraph
wires
in
half
a
dozen
places
,
carrying
away
whole
sections
to
make
repairs
more
difficult
.
It
was
over
an
hour
before
their
escape
was
discovered
,
but
still
the
news
that
Barton
was
free
flashed
across
the
central
portion
of
the
state
.
It
reached
Donald
Kruger
in
his
massive
home
in
Burlingame
.
It
reached
the
mines
at
North
San
Juan
and
Bloomfield
.
It
brought
men
out
of
bed
and
sent
them
into
hurried
conferences
.
For
everyone
involved
knew
that
the
whole
valley
was
a
powder
keg
,
and
Mitchell
Barton
the
fuse
which
could
send
it
into
explosive
violence
.
Creighton
Hague
sat
in
his
office
above
the
Ione
pit
.
The
office
was
of
logs
,
four
rooms
,
each
heated
by
an
iron
stove
.
The
building
was
dwarfed
by
the
scene
outside
.
There
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played
their
seventy-five-foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was
the
mountainside
.
The
gravel
was
the
bed
of
an
ancient
river
,
buckled
in
some
prehistoric
upheaval
of
earth
.
It
was
partially
cemented
by
ages
and
pressure
,
yet
it
crumpled
before
the
onslaught
of
the
powerful
streams
,
the
force
of
a
thousand
fire
hoses
,
and
with
the
gold
it
held
washed
down
through
the
long
sluices
.
A
million
dollars'
of
gold
a
month
.
A
million
tons
of
rock
and
soil
and
brush
.
The
monitors
ran
twenty-four
hours
each
day
.
Their
roar
,
like
the
swelling
volume
of
a
hundred
tornadoes
could
be
heard
for
miles
.
Hague
,
like
all
who
worked
near
the
pits
,
was
partly
deafened
from
the
constant
assault
against
his
eardrums
.
He
was
a
big
man
,
wearing
a
neat
flannel
shirt
against
the
cold
foothill
air
.
Fat
showed
in
loose
rolls
beneath
the
shirt
.
Ten
years
older
than
Mitch
Barton
,
he
had
clawed
his
way
up
from
mucker
in
the
pits
to
manager
of
the
operation
.
He
was
proud
of
his
accomplishments
,
proud
of
his
job
,
proud
that
Donald
Kruger
and
his
associates
trusted
him
.
He
lived
and
breathed
for
the
mining
company
.
No
man
could
have
reached
his
spot
nor
held
it
without
being
ruthless
,
and
Hague
had
made
a
virtue
of
ruthlessness
all
of
his
life
.
There
came
a
ghost
of
noise
at
the
office
door
and
Hague
swung
to
see
Kodyke
in
the
entrance
from
the
outer
room
.
Hague
had
never
accustomed
himself
to
Kodyke
.
The
man
was
tall
,
thin
,
with
a
narrow
face
and
a
too-large
nose
.
The
eyes
always
held
Hague
,
eyes
of
a
dead
man
,
lidless
as
a
lizard's
,
with
the
fixed
intensity
of
a
cobra
.
Even
Hague
was
repelled
by
the
machinelike
deadliness
that
was
Kodyke
.
He
knew
nothing
about
the
man's
history
.
Kodyke
had
appeared
at
the
mine
one
day
bearing
a
letter
from
Kruger
.
Kodyke
was
to
head
the
dread
company
police
.
He
ran
the
change
rooms
.
He
threw
out
the
hi-graders
.
He
supervised
the
cleanups
and
handled
the
shipments
of
raw
gold
which
each
week
went
out
to
San
Francisco
.
Hague
squeezed
down
his
uneasy
dislike
.
He
pulled
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
and
drew
out
a
tintype
.
``
This
is
Mitchell
Barton
.
He
broke
out
of
Folsom
last
night
.
Apparently
he
bribed
one
of
the
guards
.
We
want
him
back
there
or
we
want
him
dead
''
.
Kodyke
took
the
picture
in
a
lean
hand
,
studying
it
thoughtfully
.
``
Dangerous
''
?
?
``
Dangerous
,
yes
.
You
know
how
the
ranchers
in
the
valley
are
.
They
blame
us
for
all
their
troubles
.
Ten
years
ago
they
blew
up
some
of
our
ditches
.
It
cost
us
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
thirty
days
lost
time
to
fix
them
.
We
don't
want
Barton's
Night
Riders
loose
again
''
.
The
gunman
nodded
,
slipping
the
picture
into
his
breast
pocket
,
saying
nothing
.
Normally
Hague
wasted
no
words
,
but
now
he
found
himself
unable
to
stop
their
flow
although
he
knew
Kodyke
was
aware
of
all
he
said
.
If
she
sensed
any
unusual
preoccupation
on
the
part
of
her
mother
,
she
did
not
comment
upon
it
.
After
they
had
finished
eating
,
Melissa
took
Sprite
the
kitten
under
her
arm
--
``
so
that
Auntie
Grace
can
teach
it
about
the
whistle
''
--
and
climbed
into
the
station
wagon
beside
her
mother
.
She
had
offered
to
walk
,
but
Pamela
knew
she
would
not
feel
comfortable
about
her
child
until
she
had
personally
confided
her
to
the
care
of
the
little
pink
woman
who
chose
to
be
called
``
Auntie
''
.
When
they
reached
their
neighbor's
house
,
Pamela
said
a
few
polite
words
to
Grace
and
kissed
Melissa
lightly
on
the
forehead
,
the
impulse
prompted
by
a
stray
thought
--
of
the
type
to
which
she
was
frequently
subject
these
days
--
that
they
might
never
see
one
another
again
.
Then
she
turned
the
station
wagon
around
and
headed
it
back
down
the
hill
,
with
the
village
as
her
ostensible
destination
.
As
she
drove
,
she
thought
about
her
plan
.
It
was
really
quite
simple
.
So
simple
,
in
fact
,
that
it
might
even
work
--
although
Pamela
,
now
,
in
her
new
frame
of
mind
,
was
careful
not
to
pretend
too
much
assurance
.
That
mistake
,
she
thought
,
had
cost
her
dearly
these
past
few
days
,
and
she
wanted
to
avoid
falling
into
any
more
of
the
traps
that
the
mountain
might
set
for
her
.
She
must
be
cautious
so
as
not
to
alert
the
scheming
forest
.
When
the
station
wagon
drew
abreast
of
the
dusty
dirt
road
that
led
up
to
the
porch
of
the
Culver
house
,
Pamela
turned
the
wheel
,
guiding
the
car
to
its
familiar
parking
spot
close
to
the
house
,
and
stopped
.
All
of
her
movements
were
careful
and
methodical
,
partaking
of
the
stealth
of
a
criminal
who
has
plotted
his
felony
for
months
in
advance
and
knows
exactly
which
step
to
take
next
in
the
course
of
the
final
execution
of
his
crime
.
She
locked
the
ignition
,
removed
the
keys
,
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
house
.
Here
,
she
dropped
the
keys
on
a
small
table
beside
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
.
On
her
bureau
lay
a
small
,
brass
ornament
of
simple
design
and
faded
engraving
--
an
object
which
,
Pamela
believed
now
,
had
been
the
property
of
her
great-grandfather
,
Major
Hiram
Munroe
Culver
.
He
had
belonged
to
this
land
and
,
perhaps
,
had
desecrated
it
--
and
this
was
the
only
material
symbol
that
remained
of
him
.
If
she
,
Pamela
,
were
being
held
responsible
for
his
crimes
,
then
hers
must
be
the
final
act
of
expiation
.
She
would
return
this
symbol
to
the
mountain
,
as
one
pours
seed
back
into
the
soil
every
Spring
or
as
ancient
fertility
cults
demand
annual
human
sacrifice
.
Slowly
and
thoughtfully
,
she
slipped
the
ornament
into
the
pocket
of
her
slacks
,
moved
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
.
There
was
only
one
place
where
the
mountain
might
receive
her
--
that
unnamed
,
unnameable
pool
harbored
in
its
secret
bosom
.
Atonement
,
if
atonement
were
possible
,
could
only
be
made
at
that
sacred
,
sacrificial
basin
.
It
was
there
that
she
would
have
to
enact
her
renunciation
,
beg
forgiveness
.
Perhaps
it
was
insane
,
Pamela
thought
.
Perhaps
it
was
all
a
vividly
conceived
dream
.
But
she
was
caught
in
it
,
and
she
faced
the
terrible
possibility
that
,
if
it
were
a
dream
,
it
was
one
from
which
she
might
never
awaken
.
Facing
the
forest
now
,
she
who
had
not
dared
to
enter
it
before
,
walked
between
two
trees
at
random
and
headed
in
what
she
believed
was
the
direction
of
the
pool
.
She
remembered
little
of
her
previous
journey
there
with
Grace
,
and
she
could
but
hope
that
her
dedication
to
her
mission
would
enable
her
to
accomplish
it
.
The
forest
was
open
and
freely
welcoming
,
extending
an
enchanted
hand
.
The
ground
was
covered
with
soft
pine
needles
and
the
slope
was
gentle
.
Birds
chirped
and
chattered
in
the
trees
and
the
sun
,
all
dewy-eyed
and
soft
,
caressed
her
shoulders
warmly
from
time
to
time
.
It
was
not
,
thought
Pamela
,
such
an
evil
place
after
all
.
No
wonder
Melissa
responded
so
completely
to
its
beckoning
.
Perhaps
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
these
trees
that
whispered
their
secrets
above
her
head
as
she
passed
.
Was
it
not
possible
,
after
all
,
that
the
forest
was
in
league
with
her
and
her
child
that
its
sympathy
lay
with
the
Culvers
that
she
had
erred
in
failing
to
understand
this
?
?
Pamela
felt
calm
and
peaceful
as
she
walked
along
.
The
slight
flutter
that
had
disturbed
the
motion
of
her
heart
when
she
entered
the
forest
was
gone
now
,
and
even
the
dim
groves
of
trees
through
which
she
occasionally
passed
did
not
reawaken
her
fear
.
She
regarded
them
as
signs
that
she
was
nearing
the
glen
she
sought
,
and
she
was
glad
to
at
last
be
doing
something
positive
in
her
unenunciated
,
undefined
struggle
with
the
mountain
and
its
darkling
inhabitants
.
Having
persisted
too
long
in
deliberate
ignorance
and
denial
of
the
forces
that
threatened
her
,
Pamela
was
relieved
now
to
admit
their
potency
and
to
be
taking
definite
steps
toward
grappling
with
them
.
A
few
days
ago
,
she
would
have
thought
such
an
expedition
as
this
utterly
ridiculous
;
;
today
,
on
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
utterly
reasonable
.
She
did
not
pause
to
consider
what
she
would
do
if
her
plan
should
fail
;
;
she
directed
all
of
her
mental
and
physical
energy
toward
achieving
this
one
goal
.
