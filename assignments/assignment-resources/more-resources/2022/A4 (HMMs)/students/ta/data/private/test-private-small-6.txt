As
it
was
,
his
absence
because
of
his
final
illness
was
a
blow
to
the
administration
.
With
Republican
presidents
,
he
fought
fair
.
He
was
his
own
man
,
not
an
automatic
obstructionist
.
He
kept
his
attacks
on
Republicanism
for
partisan
campaigns
,
but
that
is
part
of
the
game
he
was
born
to
play
.
Under
any
name
--
Mr.
Speaker
,
Mr.
Democrat
,
Mr.
Sam
--
he
was
a
good
man
.
un
off
the
Congo
track
Thirteen
Italian
airmen
who
went
to
the
Congo
to
serve
the
cause
of
peace
under
the
United
Nations
banner
have
instead
met
violent
death
at
the
hands
of
Congolese
troops
supposedly
their
friends
.
In
18
months
,
no
more
grisly
incident
has
been
reported
from
that
jungle
.
Simply
out
of
bloodlust
,
their
murderers
dismembered
the
bodies
and
tossed
the
remains
into
the
river
.
The
excuse
was
offered
for
them
that
they
had
mistaken
the
Italians
for
Belgian
mercenaries
.
In
other
words
,
atrocities
by
savages
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
central
government
might
be
condoned
,
had
the
victims
been
serving
the
cause
of
dissident
Katanga
.
Does
this
suggest
that
the
Congo
is
fit
for
nationhood
or
that
UN
is
making
any
progress
whatever
toward
its
goal
of
so
making
it
?
?
To
the
contrary
,
through
the
past
six
weeks
violence
has
been
piled
upon
violence
.
Mass
rapes
,
troop
mutinies
,
uncontrolled
looting
and
pillage
and
reckless
military
adventures
,
given
no
sanction
by
any
political
authority
,
have
become
almost
daily
occurrences
.
Yet
this
basic
condition
of
outlawry
and
anarchy
is
not
the
work
of
Katanga
.
It
happens
in
the
territory
of
the
Leopoldville
government
,
which
is
itself
a
fiction
,
demonstrably
incapable
of
governing
,
and
commanding
only
such
limited
credit
abroad
as
UN
support
gives
it
.
The
main
question
raised
by
the
incident
is
how
much
longer
will
UN
bury
its
head
in
the
sand
on
the
Congo
problem
instead
of
facing
the
bitter
fact
that
it
has
no
solution
in
present
terms
?
?
The
probable
answer
is
that
it
will
do
so
just
as
long
as
Russia
can
exercise
a
veto
in
favor
of
chaos
and
until
young
African
nations
wake
up
to
the
truth
that
out
of
false
pride
they
are
visiting
ruin
on
Central
Africa
.
