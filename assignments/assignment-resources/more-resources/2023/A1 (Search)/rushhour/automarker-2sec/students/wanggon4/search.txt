The most significant thing I learned from this exercise the tradeoff between speed and accuracy for heuristic function.
Before realizing the importance of the time complexity for heuristic function, I tried to be as accurate as possible on
predicting the number of block cars for each goal vehicles with every direction under all scenarios. This resulted in two
very complex functions and a run time of O(g*n) where g is the number of goal vehicle and n is the total number of vehicle.
This approach not only suffers in time but also low mistake tolerance and low readability.

After changing approach to speed up heuristic function, I was able to solve some problems that previous heuristic was not
able to under 1 second. Although some results are not optimal when using greedy best first search, it is giving some answers
at least.

Therefore, when designing a heuristic function, it is important to consider its time complexity and even sacrifice some accuracy for
faster runtime sometimes. The design of heuristics is an ongoing process, and there is always room for improvement,
but considering the trade-off between speed and accuracy is a crucial step towards designing effective heuristics.
