The most significant thing I have learned from this exercise is A* searching and generating heuristic value when
searching for the best path. I learned about which path would be the most optimal for choosing and how that can lead
to a quicker and complete search of a given puzzle.

Some obstacles that I have encountered was figuring out how to determine if a given car reaches a specific goal. And
figuring out the distance a car is from a goal when generating the heuristic given its length. This was tricky because
the car can go out of the grid and wrap around on the other end. How I manage to resolve this issue is learning more
about the manhattan distance that was discussed in class and using that to calculate my heuristic value.
