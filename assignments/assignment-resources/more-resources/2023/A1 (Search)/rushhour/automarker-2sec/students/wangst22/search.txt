The single most significant thing I learned here, is that when it comes to machine learning heuristics, an objectively good one is quite impossible.
Even with problems that have well defined solutions and ruling, an complete judge of that condition is not always efficent. it is always a balance between distinct judgements
and speed. I myself had a dozen "good enough" metrics for determining wether a board was bad. But for each, there were about a dozen ways to implement each, all with their own
characteristics, pros and cons. It was up to me, and programmers like me everywhere, to balance it.
Additionally, my one heuristic is only based on the current state, a surface judging that only includes the minimal moves required to move all obstructing vehicles.
But there are many macro factors one can consider, like the vehicles surrounding the goal, amount of movable cars, etc
Or even more signifers, maybe vehicles at the edge tend to reach goals faster.
This is not even discounting the fact that we are designing for human construct, a puzzle.
Could we determine a cognitive trend endemic to this kind of puzzle? can this signifiy any cognitive quirk?
Further still, all of this was assuming the given board was solveable, what if it was not? how does one detect and filter the impossible board? can one define a heuristic for
that?
There probably will never be a perfect heuristic, but there will always be one suited to every need. And our job is not to be perfect, but fit for the job.
