The most significant thing I learned from this assignment was how a heuristic cost can greatly change how a state space is to be searched. 
I learned that heuristics can be made better to illustrate how certain state spaces "look" and to estimate which nodes or paths would 
"cost more" based on the heuristic. It makes path searching and search algorithms more interesting to look at; it gives the search 
algorithm another sense in a way that helps it pick more optimal paths.

My approaches to rushhour_goal_fn and heur_min_dist were pretty simple enough, though I did have to change the board dimensions around 
to fit my x-y coordinate system (coordinates were flipped due to confusion with (# rows, # columns) and (x, y)). For heur_alternate, I 
needed to try to make my heuristic explain more in terms of the board, so I had to create more test cases for how the vehicle was supposed 
to touch the goal entrance, in what direction, wrapping around the board, etc. It took a lot of trial and error, as well as visualizing the 
test cases on MS Paint in order to get a better understanding on how to calculate the distances. The f-value functions were simple enough, 
as well as the weighted_astar.

Questions that remain to be resolved are the iterative search algorithms; I just can't seem to understand the costbound and its uses, as 
well as how to implement it properly within my code. Not sure how to properly update the weights and f-values as well for iterative 
weighted a star.
