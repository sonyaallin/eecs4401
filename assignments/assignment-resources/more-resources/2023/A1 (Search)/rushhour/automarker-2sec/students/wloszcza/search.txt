The most significant thing that I learned from this assignment is how A* and it’s variations compare to each other and how different heuristics can affect the search results. For the heuristic functions, considering orientation had improved the search compared to the basic minimum heuristic. My alternative heuristic was fairly similar to the basic minimum heuristic, but I made it give more accurate distances by calculating distances from the end of the car that should touch the goal based on orientation. I did this because the basic heuristic would vary based on vehicle length where long vehicles might seem close to a goal when they really require many moves. For the alternative heuristic function, I tried considering more of the board such as how many cars are blocking the path from a goal vehicle to a goal. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to improve my search results and removed this attempt from my submission, but I imagine this would have been on the right track since a blocked path would involve extra moves to get other cars out of the way. The different search strategies implemented had fairly similar results, but they were slightly different with iterative A* giving a better result for one extra test case compared to greedy best first search. I also noticed my results varying based on whether I used my laptop or a lab pc with the lab pc giving slightly better results and more consistently. It would be interesting to compare hardware and multithreading.
