# I leaned that there are indeed different ways to do search problems, based on the different formula
# The result and expanded way will be completely different. Specially, when there is hyperparameter
# like wight, the result of our search will be vary. Therefore, I believe based on different search 
# question, we should have different way to implement the question for AI. However, one thing that I
# really want to talk about is the file structure of this assignemnt. It's really nice design, we have
# a defined search base, everytime a new question comes in all we need to do is overwritte and add
# few classes, such as water jag and parking. Both used same search.py but implement differently. 
# It's a really nice and clean design I have to say.
