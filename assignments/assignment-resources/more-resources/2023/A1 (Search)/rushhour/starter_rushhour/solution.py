    # We want an admissible heuristic, which is an optimistic heuristic.
    # It must never overestimate the cost to get from the current state to the goal.
    # Getting to the goal requires one move for each tile of distance.
    # Since the board wraps around, there will be two different directions that lead to a goal.
    # NOTE that we want an estimate of the number of moves required from our current state
    # 1. Proceeding in the first direction, let MOVES1 =
    #    number of moves required to get to the goal if it were unobstructed and if we ignore the orientation of the goal
    # 2. Proceeding in the second direction, let MOVES2 =
    #    number of moves required to get to the goal if it were unobstructed and if we ignore the orientation of the goal
    #
    # Our heuristic value is the minimum of MOVES1 and MOVES2 over all goal vehicles.
    # You should implement this heuristic function exactly, and you can improve upon it in your heur_alternate
