#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

From the games unit I learnt about the minimax strategy. Obviously in a technical 
sense in this assignment but what really struck me is how the strategy actually 
works. I understood from before that real world games have massive amounts 
of possible moves so I assumed that an AI would need to have a very complex 
strategy in order to consistently win games. The fact that minimax a strategy
that simply limits what the opponent can do works quite often was a mind-opening
realization. To be fair using minimax still requires a lot of work to implement
since it needs to look at a large number of states but the underlying goal 
of the strategy is quite trivial.
