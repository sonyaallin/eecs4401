#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The most significant thing I've learned from the Games AI unit is that preparing for the worst leads to the best outcome.
When deciding what strategy to use/ move to make, the AI analyses what move is most advantageous for their opponent (as you would
in real life two-player games) and assumes that move will be made. This way, if the opponent doesn't play their best, it's 
advantageous for the player, and if the opponent does, it is clear to see what the outcome would be, and if the game is worth 
pursuing. If the game is not worth pursuing, no more time/ space resources (in the case of humans, usually mental or monetary 
resources) need to be spent on the game since there's no way of winning. Another thing I've learned is the continued importance
of caching and the power of the dictionary data type when it comes to accessing cached elements.
