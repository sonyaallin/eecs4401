What did I learn from the games module?

I learned about the MiniMax strategy which maximises a player's potential payoff 
while minimizing his/her opponents'. This strategy can be employed in a variety of
two-player zero sum games such as Chess, Go, and Othello. I also learned that checkers, 
a childhood game of mine, has been solved, which means that assuming both sides play
perfectly, the game's outcome can be correctly predicted from any position. The recursive
nature of "solving" games is what makes it one of my favourite topics of AI. The fact that
we must play based on our opponent, who plays based on how we play and so on. This was
certainly my favourite topic in this course! 

As a side note, Othello also brings back fun memories of CSC207 :D
