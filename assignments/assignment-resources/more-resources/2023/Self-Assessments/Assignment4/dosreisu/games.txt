I think one of the big takeways is how over-caching can actually slow down your code. I attempted to cache more than what was asked by looking
at parallel states (eg mirrored or rotated) which required some matrix operations. Unfortunately, the cost of adding the operations was too 
large and it ended up slowing the code down instead of speeding it up. Thus, I ended with just storing the basic state. 
Also out of all the improvements we tried, alpha-beta pruning definitely had a big impact and was pretty cool to see, but I personally liked
caching the best as it allowed to go from not being able to do something at all to solving it in seconds!
When making my heuristic I also learned that sometimes what I think will be good additions to the heuristic end up making it worse. This was
interesting because I based what I did on the strategy guide for Othello and to see some of their strategies not improve the AI was unexpected.
After looking at it, I think it may have to do with the weighting of that piece of the strategy relative to the others and so it is important to 
test different impact sizes.
