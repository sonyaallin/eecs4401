#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I learned some very important things in the games unit. I learned how many games today use the minimax algorithm to run the AI. The Minmax algorithm is a very important algorithm that works by calculating in a tree, which choice will maximize the children, which are then calculated by recursively picking the choice that will minimize its children. This will continue until is a base case is reached and there must be a utility function used to determine the final value. There are many heuristic functions that can be used as a utility function. The http://www.radagast.se/othello/Help/strategy.html helped me to find many good strategies to use in developing my heuristic. The Minimax algorithm is another instance of a search algorithm in AI, and is an example of DFS search. This makes me realize how important search algorithms are and how techniques like pruning, caching, and depth-limiting can cause significant speed boosts to runtime.
