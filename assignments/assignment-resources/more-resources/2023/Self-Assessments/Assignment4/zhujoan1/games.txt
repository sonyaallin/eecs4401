#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I learned that there is different strategies to search in a game tree problem,
and some might work better than others in some situations and vice versa. Searching
a game tree is also very similar to regular search and heuristic is involved as well
to make the search better. And I also learned that to make an ai always win no matter how the
other player plays require a lot of planning and different searches depending on
what the other player does and how it affects the resulting board. Time also plays a role 
too since there could be a limit in how long a player takes to choose a move, so pruning
is involved as well.
