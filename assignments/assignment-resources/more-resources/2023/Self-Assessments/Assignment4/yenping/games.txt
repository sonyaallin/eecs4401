#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

One significant thing I learned while working on this assignment is that I focus on a player at a time. Initially I intended
to model both players within the recursive calls, but I soon realize that it will be too complicated and redundant since
I am working with a zero-sum game model. Additionally, discover a method to reduce search space is very crucial. It is 
necessary to have high responsiveness for a game AI, and thus discovering a fine search space reduction method is important.
Last but not least, I learn that finding features that critically determine the game result is important for the game AI.
Different features may affect the game outcomes differently, and weighting those features appropriately in the heuristic
allows us to build a smarter game AI.
