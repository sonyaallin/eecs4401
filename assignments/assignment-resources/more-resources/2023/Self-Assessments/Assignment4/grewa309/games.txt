#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Although we did learn about BFS, DFS, and heuristics. We only looked at this topic as it
related to path finding where we want to get to a specific goal node or state. In this unit
we looked at how we can leverage DFS to create player for games that chooses the most
optimal moves. We looked at how we can use a search tree to find the best move keeping in
mind that the opponent player may very well make the best possible move. Moreover, we looked at
how to improve these searches with the likes of heuristics, depth limits, ordering, etc.
