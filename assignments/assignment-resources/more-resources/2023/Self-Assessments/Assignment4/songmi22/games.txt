#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
From the games unit, I could learn the basics of the 'how the AI works and thinks' and learnt to develop an algorithm that searches and finds a solution which can be
implemented in real life. This was an interesting assignment since this is the by far most practical assignment in this course as well as in my journey through computer
science. Now I can know how to implement, explain and measure the minmax node and alphabeta pruning process.
