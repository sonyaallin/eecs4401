I learnt about minimax algorithm and the alpha beta pruning. I have been a huge 
fan of chess (I have been playing chess since I was 6 years old) and computer chess 
and I have wondered how stockfish (previous best chess computer) works. It was 
extrememly fascinating to learn about these algorithms and how it is possible to 
implement this algorithm in various discrete, finite games. I truly enjoyed learning 
about all these algorithms and I am thrilled to employ this algorithm on chess after 
this course. This course was very well taught by prof Sonya Allin and would like to 
thank her for this experience.
