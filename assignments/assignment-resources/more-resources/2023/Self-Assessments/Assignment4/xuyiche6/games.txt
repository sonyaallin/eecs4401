#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
The game unit is quite fun! In this assignment, I enjoyed building the harder and harder AI to play against myself. 
Well, to be honest, I barely won the machineâ€¦ The AI with alphabeta and ordering considers way too much than me and I lost every time. 

I am now more impressed by the power of searching and pruning algorithm. I prefer alpha-beta pruning more because it will cut off earlier and get better running time. 
However, the running time of either minimax or the alphabeta is quite long and it most of the time will overtime with depth more than 6. 

The ordering function took me most of the time and i put a lot of time trying to optimize its running time. However, it worked a little bit strange...

Overall, this assignment is very fun and it leads me to the world of AI in computer games though the actual AI in those games is much complex than this one.
