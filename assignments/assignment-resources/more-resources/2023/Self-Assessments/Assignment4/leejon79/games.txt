#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Surprisingly, the thing that I found most interesting in this unit was the
miniMax algorithm. When I first saw it, I didn't quite understand how it
worked or why it worked (if you can't tell, I'm a little behind for this
class), however, having successfully (at least I think successfully)
implemented said algorithm into the assignment, I find that it is not as
complicated as I initially thought and that I actually kinda like this one
with its simplicity. On the other hand, I'm still not entirely sure what's
going on with the alpha beta algorithm despite implementing (I hope correctly)
it in the assignment. That one I'll have to figure out while I study for
the exam.
