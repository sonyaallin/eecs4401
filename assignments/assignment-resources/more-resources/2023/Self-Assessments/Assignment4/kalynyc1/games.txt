#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The most interesting part of the games unit is the game algorithms like minimax and alpha-beta cuts.
It was very interesting to see that relatively-complex games can be broken down to the series of steps for
each player, and the result of the game can be calculated even before the game started using such relatively-simple
algorithms. This unit showed me that any game (or life situation) after bringing it to the certain level of abstraction
can be analyzed and predicted with the very high performance.
