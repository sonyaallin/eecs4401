In the games unit, I learned how large (i.e. the number of possible states)
that even a simple game of Othello has at small board sizes. Although the amount
of free spaces decreases as you go deeper in the search tree, the amount of 
possible states does not necesarrily decrease with it. This is because cells
that are not empty can still be flipped in the future based on what the next move
might be. This made me realize the power that good heuristics can have in terms
of obtaining better results, and performance too. I also learned how much research
has gone into development the methods we learned in the games unit, and that the
results have been both promising and interesting in that we may have hit a wall
as far as how efficient we can make our search algorithms.
