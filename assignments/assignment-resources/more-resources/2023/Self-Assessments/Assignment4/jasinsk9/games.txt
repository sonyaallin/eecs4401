#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
I actually ended up watching the documentary about AlphaGo on Netflix as we did this unit because I had seen bits and
pieces of it before. It's so cool to see how far a computer can come that such a complex game such as Go can be played
reliably by a computer, but also insanely cool that a human player can still surprise a computer and win a game. Looking
at the Wikipedia article for the match of Lee Sedol vs. AlphaGo in game 4 which Sedol won we see David Ormerud of a Go
fan website say that he believed the loss and portions of the game around move 85 were lost by AlphaGo due to a known
weakness in Monte Carlo tree search. It's really cool that something we learn in class can be applied to this huge
milestone project in Artificial Intelligence.
