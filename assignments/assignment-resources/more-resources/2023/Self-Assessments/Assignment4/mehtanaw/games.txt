#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The most significant thing I learned from the games module was how games such as 
checkers and chess(or other 2-player zero-sum discrete finite deterministic games)
are played/performed when it is player vs computer. More specifically, I learned 
how there are algorithms that use specific game info(states, initial state, terminal 
positions, utility, etc) and then perform some strategy/algorithm(such as minimax or
alphabeta) in order to make a move at each turn. Furthermore, I learned about several 
of these algorithms and gained practical experience in implementing, debugging and 
testing them. I also learned how to create good heuristic functions in order to assign 
good values based of the current state of the board, such that the AI will make better 
decisions. Going forward, I feel confident that I can apply these skills and this new 
found knowledge to other similar game AI problems.
