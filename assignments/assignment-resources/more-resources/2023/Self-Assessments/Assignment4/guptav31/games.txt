#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The games unit was really fun. I learned that I cannot even begin to beat my own ai.
I also learned that changing function and adding features later is really difficult, as
it is very easy to forget to implement the new feature correctly everywhere. My state caching
was only implented in minimax. I did not notice that it was not implemented in alphabeta until
9 pm on the last day.

Other than that, I really enjoyed the formalization of turn-based games that the minimax algorithm makes.
I had know about game-playing AIs, but learning about how they were able to formalize a complex game and develop
an algorithm for it was insane. The intuition I've gained in this course about how to take problems and formalize them
into something much easier to work with is something I am sure will help me in the future. Especially since I develop games
as a hobby. (or at least I try to)
