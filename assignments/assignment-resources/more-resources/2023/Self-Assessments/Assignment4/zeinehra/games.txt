#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

    There are many kinds of games with varying complexities. Even simple games
such as the ones we worked with (2 player zero-sum discrete finite deterministic games)
can be very complicated. Unlike the first unit (search), a solution is not determined
by the first path searched as it is a 2-player game and the opponent chooses unfavourable
states. Determining what the best move is requires very large searches and good heuristic
functions to determine if not fully searched. Such tasks are impractical for humans and even
ai cannot search very deep due to how quickly the number of searches increase (exponential).
A game that is seemingly simple like Othello with only an 8x8 board will take an ai way too
long to brute force to terminal states to determine the best move. As such, heuristic functions
should be used based off good strategies and a depth limit needs to be used but that results
in losing optimality. Such thinking is captivating, and I enjoyed learning the intricacies
with games.
