#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?


I found the games unit interesting becuase last semester I took a course on game
theory and a big part of that course was games and finding the optimal solution
to a game. So, it was nice to approach the topic from a different perspective
in terms of AI and look into different algorithms that can be used to compute
the best move for a player. It was also interesting how different aspects from
other units played a role into this one when it comes to the algorithms. For
example, a heuristic function is used to compute the utility value of the game
states. So, in order to improve the algorithm, you would need to come up with
better heuristic. Also, another aspect is pruning which is used when it comes to
the alpha-beta pruning algorithm such that states that are definitely not going
to have an impact on the min/max utility value are not explored.
