#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Through the games unit assignment I learned more about the alpha beta pruning through the more
hands on coding of the pruning method which shed some light on parts of alpha beta pruning that I had previously
misunderstood.  Furthermore, I learned the value of caching and ordering as they really helped speed up the pruning
which in turn sped up the search. This was most apparent in the alpha-beta pruning function where the choices that were
most likely the best choice were checked first thanks to the ordering and getting the utility of repeat board states was
quicker thanks to caching. I learned that contemporary game playing agents often use sampling techniques. I learned that
Alpha Go used a lot of electricity to train.

This assignment was the best of the assignments in this course!!!!! :D
