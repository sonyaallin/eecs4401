#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

What I learned in the games unit reinforced my learning from A1. Simple/ A combination of simple heuristics
out performs complex heuristics. I was trying to implement a heuristic that would take future mobility into account
but that would result in the code timing out. I decided to go with a simpler one that just factored in the current boards
mobility and with the addition of my other 2 heuristics (try to play in corners and maximize captures) I was able to get a
working heuristic that would work for an 8x8 board. This also gave me an insight into how chess algorithms are most likely designed as 
I have seen some chess engines that ask for parameters such as depth limit.
