After A4, I learned that I am not good at writing heuristics. I was not very good at the othello game so it was very hard
for me to determine whether or not a particular state was good. I had created a heuristic that was very simple
My heuristic had two main components:
Compute heuristic description:

1. Count # of corners owned by a player
    - +1 score for each corner
2. Count # of lines owned by a player
    - +board_size -1 for each line from a corner

Then I compute two scores, one for ai color and one for opponent color and subtract (ai_score - opponent_score) to compute the heuristic value
