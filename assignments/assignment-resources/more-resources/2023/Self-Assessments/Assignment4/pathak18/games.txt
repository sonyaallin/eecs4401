#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I think this was probably my favourite assignment in CSC384. I found it quite
fascinating that games like Othello, which we hear about so often are actually
based on such simplistic algorithms like Minimax, and alpha-beta pruning. I'm
curious to try my hands on the various other games which can be implemented with these
algorithms. With this assignment, we were able to make an AI agent, which at 
most times can beat humans as well. I never realized that making an AI game agent
could be this straightforward. I like how practical and realistic this course and
its assignments were. I think it really helped me get a better and clear understanding
of the various algorithms involved in AI.
