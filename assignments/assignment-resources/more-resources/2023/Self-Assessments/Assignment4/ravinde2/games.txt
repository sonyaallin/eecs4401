I actually had no idea that checkers was solved, so I looked into it and its all quite interesting. To date it is
the largest game to be solved. 10^14 caluclations were involved over a 18 year period and it had a search space of 
5x10^20. It was solved by a man named Jonathan Schaeffer, Schaeffer wanted his robot to beat Marion Tinsley the then
worlds best checkers player.However after discovering that he had a lump on his pancreas Tinsley withdrew the game 
and would soon after die so Schaeffer's robot would never truly beat him. This lead Schaeffer to work to solve the game
as he wanted to show that his robot could have beat Tinsley
