The biggest thing I have learned is the complexity of making a search algorithm efficient. It takes a lot of finesse
trying to make my search algorithm behaved like a human instead of brute forcing. As a result It really opened my eyes
about what can AI do and how they achieve it. I found a well developed AI algorithm is really close to how a human
brain works. It takes estimates and work based on those estimates but it's much faster and efficient.
