#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Through the games unit, I learned about fundamental game theory and how the minimax algorithm has evolved over 
time to face the challenge of computational efficiency. It was very cool to see that various techniques 
(alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, etc.) have emerged to increase the computational speed while maintaining 
the accuracy or performance of the game AI. Moreover, since I had prior knowledge of Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
techniques such as DQN and MCTS, I was surprised to see the connection between classic game AI which we learned in this course, 
and more recent technology such as RL. I would like to explore more into how the traditional methods have evolved to 
RL and contributed to recent success in the field of game AI such as Alpha-Go.
