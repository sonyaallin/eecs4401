#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
I learned a lot on this assignment, the main thing I learned was how AI's work in games. I learned about the different ways 
an AI can choose a move like minimax, alphabeta and many more. There are also way to improve the performance by pruning branches 
and even keeping track of things you have encountered before. I also learned again how important heuristics are, and a good heuristics 
can make or break your AI. I did not know heuristics played such a big part in AI. I also learned how AIs in games somewhat work and why
some times AIs break, and why people are able to make AIs so powerful and hard to beat because it literally will make the best move possible and
will also thing of future outcomes as well.
