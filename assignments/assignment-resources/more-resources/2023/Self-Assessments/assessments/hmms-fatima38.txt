Bayesian Networks are an interesting concept that incorporate probabilities into solving problems. I found this to be a
very important point since many real-world problems have uncertain outcomes that previous units simply could not model.
The concept of building prior probabilities off of observed data is also very intuitive and the use of conditional
probabilities for transitions felt very appropriate. I did have some confusion at first as to why emission probabilities
were conditioned such that P(E) was with respect to the hidden state. However, the assignment helped to clarify what
exactly the purpose of the emissions are and why they are structured in that way. Normally I do have some difficulties
with probability, but learning about how they were used helped to improve my understanding of the various operations
and formulas. That would be my most significant takeway of the unit; how probability can be used to solve/represent
problems in a Bayesian network.
