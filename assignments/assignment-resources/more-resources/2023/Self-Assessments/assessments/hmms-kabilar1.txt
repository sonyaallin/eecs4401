Same old, same old!  What have we learned about Bayesian Networks?  Have you discovered 
that HMMs are everywhere?  Will you ever look at Siri the same way?  Help us understand 
by answering the following question in 100-250 words:

What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

The most significant thing that I have learnt from the Bayesian Network module is Hidden 
Markov Models and their possibility to be able to structure different structures of problems 
in a pleasant unified way. The simplicity of how Hidden Markov Models are defined and how they 
could be used is revolutionary. In addition to Hidden Markov Models the forward algorithm and 
Viterbi algorithm is an extremely efficient way to calculate the probability from the given 
information. Also Hidden Markov Models have multiple potential uses for extremely advanced 
technologies. Some examples of these include Speech Recognition, Machine Translations, and 
Robot Tracking. These are the most significant things that I have learnt from the Bayesian Network
module.
