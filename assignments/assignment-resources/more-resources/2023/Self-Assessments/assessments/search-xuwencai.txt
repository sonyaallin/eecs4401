In general, the most important thing I know is if a heuristic function is not implemented
well, then it will not help on searching at all.

If the heuristic function overestimates the cost, sometimes it will cause a lot of trouble.

We should also implement the heuristic function as smart as possible. By that I mean be as much 
accurate as you can to esticate the cost from the state to the goal.

Also, before I only know bfs and dfs and dijkstra, and I think they are already really efficient,
but there are a lot of eye opening things to me in search module.
