The most significant thing I've learned is how using tool efficiently helps with accomplishing. In the beginning I tried to brute force the
algorithm without using counter and numpy, which outputs an acceptable answer but it ruins slowly. After reading the documentation of counter
and numpy carefullt I was able to use the different functions given by packages and make my runtime faster. It extends to real life as brute
forcing is really inefficient and stresses you out. But if you can do things smart it makes a huge difference.
