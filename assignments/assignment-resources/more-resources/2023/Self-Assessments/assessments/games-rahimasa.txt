I learned that minimaxing is a really effctive way to create an AI for 2 player games   
with finite state space. I always assumed AIs for games like that used some really 
advanced heuristics and didn't know how they could predict what move the other player
would make. But using minimaxing makes a lot of sense and I will keep it in mind
in case I make an AI for a 2 player game in the future.
