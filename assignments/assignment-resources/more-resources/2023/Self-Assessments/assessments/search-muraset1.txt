#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I've learned from the search module is how
important heuristics can be for search problems. Many of the simpler search
problems that are often shown as examples in CS courses can be solved fairly
well (optimal solution and within a reasonable amount of time) by just using
the appropriate search strategy (e.g. BFS, DFS, UCS, etc.). However, this
course made me realize that more practical search problems like the Sokoban
puzzle require more than just a good search strategy. These search problems
can be very specific and complex in terms of what the most optimal step to
take is. For example, in Sokoban puzzles, you need to consider how the robots,
boxes, storage spots, and obstacles interact throughout possible steps to find
the optimal path (or even any path).
