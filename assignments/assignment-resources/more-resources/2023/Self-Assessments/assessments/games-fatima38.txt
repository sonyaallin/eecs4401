#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The games unit was very interesting since it explored the fairly simple strategies that can be used to
build smart AI players. Minimax is an algorithm that is easy to understand though in more complex games
it became clear that it would be highly inefficient. The alpha-beta pruning addition was a improvement
that was a little difficult for me to understand at first but going through examples in the tutorial helped
improve my understanding.
It was pretty interesting to learn about the kinds of games that have already been solved by AI and I had
no idea how computationally expensive it was to teach and run the models. The use of the Monte Carlo algorithm
to help overcome the limitations of the alpha-beta algorithm was also interesting especially since introducing
a degree of probability in the system makes it feel like there is more chance of failure.
