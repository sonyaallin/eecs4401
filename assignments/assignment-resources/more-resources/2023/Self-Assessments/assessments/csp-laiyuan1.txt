#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?
CSP is much different compared to search module, we only consider the constraints instead of path cost.
The way we find solutions is that first filter the domains that will obviously lead to a dead end, and then try
different variable assignments until we found a solution that satisfy all the constraints.
The thing I found very interesting for me is the idea behind binary constraints and n-aray constraints.
Although they are equal and could be represented by each other, I found out n-aray constraints are much cheaper to
implement. We will end up with a large number of constraints using binary constraints approche, which is very inefficient.
