#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

One of the things I learned was how modular CSP's actually are. As seen in cspbase.py, there are a lot of super short
methods. Moreover I noticed that the code is easily reusable. All that needs to be done is to modify the funpuzz file
to create problem applicable constraints. This is very cool to me as it is a global solution which we discussed in class
but now I got to see it hands on.
Another thing I learned was that even though GAC is usually considered better, depending on the board FC sometimes
did better. I believe this is due to checking constraints that do not need to be checked as they may lead to nowhere.
Another thing may be that with GAC we are testing more tuples whereas in FC we know exactly what tuples to play.
