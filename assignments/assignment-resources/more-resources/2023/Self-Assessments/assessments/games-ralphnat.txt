#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Although this unit was interesting, I didnt learn anything. Being close to the end of the semester, my will power to continue
has dissapeared. The material in this unit seemed very intersting and will likely be somthing that I come back to in the future,
although for the time being, I must throw in the towel. There was nothing wrong with this course and at times I enjoyed
it very much, but this assignment combined with the workload of my other CS courses was far too much to handle. Hopefully
after exams I will come back to this assignment and try to complete it.
