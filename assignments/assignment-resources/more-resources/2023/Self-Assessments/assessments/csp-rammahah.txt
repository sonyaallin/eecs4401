#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I learned from this module is the process of building a csp. When you have a problem that you want to solve using a csp the first step is to identify the variables that you want to solve for. The second step is to set the domain of each of the variables. The third step is to set the constraints on the variable. This step can be difficult, but it is crucial to solving the problem. It is important to correctly identify all the constraints and translate them into a form that can be used by the csp. From there the csp runs a search to find the solution. This relates back to the first module which involved search. From here, depending on the search algorithm used, the search goes through each variable and checks that assigning certain values to it won’t violate any constraints. Overall, it was interesting to see how csp’s work because I’ve introduced to them in other courses, but I never knew how the worked. Now, that I have had a chance to work with them, they don’t seem as difficult as I thought they would be, it is just important to break the problem down correctly using the three steps.
