#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?
The most significant thing that I learned from the CSP module is the power
of diligently reducing the domain of possibilities. Without the constant reduction
in domain, finding a solution is much more difficult and time consuming. As well,
the CSP module has opened my eyes to the different ways we are able to look at a
problem. This has shown me that looking at things with less intuitive perspective
may be the key solving a problem. Moreover, the abundance of perspectives is
each unique and beneficial in their own way. There are always multiple ways to
solve a problem, and the solution/implementation you choose often depends on
what you value more. Lastly, looking at how all the elements in a problem can be
connected displays the extensive ways that their connections can be represented.
