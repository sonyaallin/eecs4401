In this assignment, we used forward checking and Generalised Arc constraint as two forms 
of constraint propagators. Constraint propagators aim to search for values that satisfy the 
constraints. With the two propagators, we learned a way to prioritize the goals, 
instead of the paths. We learned a way to account for constraints in finding suitable values 
for searches. In forward checking, we pruned values from the domains that could hinder the search
in the future. In Generalised Arc constraint, we prune values from the domains that are 
arc-inconsistent. We also represent the states using variables, constraints, domains to generate
more efficient algorithms.
