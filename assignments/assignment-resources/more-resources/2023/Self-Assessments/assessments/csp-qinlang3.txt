#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

After finishing A2, I found that csp search module is such a powerful tool when 
dealing with constraint satisfication problems. I found that most significant thing
of a csp module is how well the techniques we used for pruning domain values for 
variables. Both FC and GAC are these techniques. FC method use the intuition of 
looking head and prune potential values that violate constraints. GAC checks for 
constraints consistency and it makes much more pruning. After implementing 
those, from the test result, it shows that using GAC is faster than FC when the 
board size and constraints size are large. And the reason why FC is slower than 
GAC is that when the board or constraints size are large, FC does much more
variable assignments and backtrackings than GAC, which means FC makes a lot of wrong 
variable assignments and have to undo them, that slows down the computaion.
