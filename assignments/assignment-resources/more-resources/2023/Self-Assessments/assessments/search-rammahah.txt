#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I learned that the most important part of a search algorithm is the heuristic. The more accurate the 
heuristic is, the faster and more accurate the search can be. However, it is extremely difficult to create
an accurate heuristic. Creating the search algorithms is fairly simple and straight forward, whereas
when it comes to the heuristic it is more about trial an error. During the assignment I spent hours, trying
different heuristics and in the end, the final heuristic could still have been better. While doing the 
assignment, I realized that an accurate heuristic is key because it allows the search algorithm to know what
state to expand next. For example, for the a* search we expand the state with the smallest f value, if the
h value isn't even close to accurate we could end up expanding the unnecessary states which waste time. 
This can be seen for the Manhattan distance heuristic since it only checks the distance from each box to the 
target. It does not take into account the position of the robots. So, h-value doesn't change until a box is moved, 
which means until then the search algorithm treats every successor state equally. Overall, I learned that 
performing an effective search for a solution comes down to the heuristic function.
