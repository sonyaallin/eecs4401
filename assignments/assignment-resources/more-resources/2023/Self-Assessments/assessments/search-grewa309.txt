The whole concept of introducing heurstics into our search algorithms was really interesting
and mind-blowing. I didn't realize how adding a heuristics to our search can improve our search 
result times by so much. What is more interesting is how applicable these heuristics are in 
real life scenerios like games, maps, etc. This is a concept that I will differently try to 
utilize in my future projects to get the best possible performance. Further, to balance 
time and space using concepts like iterative deeping was a totally new concept to me and although
simple, it is so useful. Usually I thought about either using BFS or DFS, but iterative deepining
showed me a 3rd method which combines the two and takes the best of both searches to create 
something really useful
