#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing that I have learned from this module is that CSP’s 
are everywhere. Although I had not known what a CPS was formally, I was 
interacting with them on almost a day-to-day basis. From my daily game of wordle 
or choosing which events I could attend in a given time frame to planning a 
vacation and many more. Not only that but I was able to formalize the strategies
that I was using to solve the CSP’s I was interacting with daily. What I took 
away from the module is formal ways to solve CSP’s and to try and identify a CSP
since I already know how to solve them.
