What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

This module has shown me that HMMs are everywhere. This had made me
think differently about voice assistants overall. That voice assistants definitely work using probability more than voice
recognition as i have seen that they are sometimes way off with there interpretation of what was said. Another thing is
that they would never be done training, everytime you correct what was said would alter the data. As individual correcting
data points they would not correct the data by much however in the grand scheme with all users over several years the
corrections will certainly take a more influential part.
