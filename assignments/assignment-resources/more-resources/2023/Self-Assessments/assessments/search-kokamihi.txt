What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

One of the more important things I learnt was the concept of heuristics and
how they can be applied to create a variety of differences in your search
algorithm along with the versatility of search algorithms.Before this module
when I thought of search algorithms I would think of things like pathfinding to a
certain location or finding a certain object in a state space. I didnâ€™t think
it could be applied to solving a puzzle like we did in the Sokoban game assignment.
Learnt how to create search algorithms and the differences between them,
how we can trade cost for speed or optimality of our solution.
The idea/concept of a state space and how to begin creating/using a search.
This is a concept that can later be applied in other fields on cs and feels
like an important building block to have in your arsenal
