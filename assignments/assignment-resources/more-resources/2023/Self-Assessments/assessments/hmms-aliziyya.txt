The most significant thing I learnt from this unit is the usage of probability in AI. I especially liked how 
markov models and their beauty. It was so cool to see the math involved and it was all just really simple. I 
also liked the way we can set values for things we've never seen before and still get an output. The 
viterbi algorithm was no exception to this. It seems complicated at first but after rationalizing and working 
through it, you see how it all works and how easy it is to implement. Personally, I liked working with numpy
again and found it enjoyable to make this run as efficiently as I know.
