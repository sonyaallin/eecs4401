The games unit feels like a more specialized version of the search unit, which feels obvious to say, given the search unit's assignment being a game. The idea of minimax, while extremely efficient at determining "optimal" play, is interesting in the way that it can easily fall to an opponent making less than optimal moves, whereas if the AI had known what move would be taken in the future, it might make a different move in the present. I find the determinism inherent to that question fascinating, even if it is somewhat out of scope for the assignment. Alpha-beta pruning is a delightful idea, which, while intuitive and easy to understand why it's good, is also an inspired idea that not many people would think of, which I find to be true of many things in this class.
