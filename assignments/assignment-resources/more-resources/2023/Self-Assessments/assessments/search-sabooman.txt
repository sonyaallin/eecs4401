#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

In this assignment, we came across several types of searches, their advantages, and disadvantages. The most significant thing I
learned is when to use one search over the other. In the case of heuristic search, we use heuristic value
such that we attain an approximate measure of how close we are to finding our solution. Using manhattan 
distance as a heuristic, we attain the distance between a box and the closest storage, adding them up. 
This heuristic assumes the other obstacles and edge cases are not worth considering. Thus, we have an admissible, 
but flawed heuristic. Our alternate heuristic, which we write in the assignment, bridges the flaws and reduces
the time required for the search, providing better approximates. Weighted a-star search, on the other hand, 
introduces a weight such that f(node) = g(node) + weight(h(node)), where g(node) is the cost of reaching the node
and h(node) is the heuristic value of each node. Iterative weighted a-star search is one step ahead of weighted a-star search.
We alter the weights such that we return the optimum path with the least f(node) value. In iterative gbfs search,
we return the optimum path with the least g(node), improving the quality of a regular greedy first search 
(that only expands node with the lowest h-value).
