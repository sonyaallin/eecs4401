#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most important thing I learned about the search module is that when
choosing a search algorithm there are many things that should be taken
into consideration, such as time constraints, number of iterations, storage
used, depth traversed, and others. It is important to note that it is
required to make decisions because you may want to use a storage efficient
algorithm such as Depth First Search, which does not necessarily give
the shortest path to the solution. So, there is always a trade-off and
as developers we need to be aware and choose the one that has the
characteristics that are important for the problem being solved.
Something that emphasizes even more this idea of being aware of the
trade-offs, is the checking that is done to remove nodes if some condition
is satisfied, using DFS as an example again, it would not be interesting
to use cycle checking with DFS, because cycle checking requires a lot of
space, which goes against the main idea of DFS (to be space efficient).
So, I think the most important thing that I learned from the search module
is being aware of the trade-offs of each algorithm and the types of
checking to be able to achieve the expected result.
