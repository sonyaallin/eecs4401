#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing that I've learned from the CSP module is how the
efficiency or runtime of an algorithm is often highly dependent on the problem
being solved. For example, forward checking can be much faster than
backtracking search, but it can also be much worse depending on the type of
problem and even how the problem is defined (e.g. binary not-equal constraints
vs. using n-ary all-different constraints). Learning about the weaknesses that
certain algorithms have makes analyzing and comparing different algorithms
very interesting because you have to consider what works and what tradeoffs
have to be made. Combining what I've learned in the CSP module with what I've
learned in the search module, I think I'm starting to understand how difficult
it is to create effective and efficient AIs.
