#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I have learned is the way to improve a search algorithm.
Different ways of optimize the algorithm will result different outcomes. Depending
on our preference, we can choose different method to meet our needs, For instance,
we could use Iterative Depending A* Search to save memory usage. Or we could use
greedy search to get a solution faster, but the solution may not be optimal one.
Like what we have done during this assignment, we can even run a search algorithm
iteratively and using the previous result to keep improving the solution. This is
something I never thought about before. When we build an application, we want it
to show some content faster to improve user's experience. If the customer has more
powerful machine,we can keep search for a better solution. By using this concept,
we can effectively eliminate long blank screen time.
