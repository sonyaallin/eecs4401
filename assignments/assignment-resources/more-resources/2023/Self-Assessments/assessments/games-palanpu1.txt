#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
I got a much better insight as to how AI works in video games, and that most of the time an optimal decision is not chosen because it may be too computationally difficult to find, and thus a 'good enough' one is chosen. I also learned that sometimes, 'good enough' may not actually be a good decision in the long run based on the kind of heuristic used. I also find it interesting that this sort of AI picks the best possible option for the opponent as well when searching for a path, which means that if the full game tree is known, it will almost always have the best possible outcome. However, I think that if the tree is not known and it is simply guessing what could be the best move, then things could go unexpected down the line.
