#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

To choose the best next step, we need to consider about opponents. We always want to optimize our utility and minimize the opponents', and that's the idea behind MinMax algorithm. 
However, we are actully using depth first search. Thus, the time required is very large as long as depth increases. To encounter this problem, we introduce the idea of alpha-beta pruning.
In a nutshell, game unit is a little bit too short but it's actullay very useful for me, and we could explore a lot about bot player strategy based on the knowledge of this unit.
