#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most important thing I learned is that fact that when doing search algorithms, there can be so many
factors involved when trying to optimize the solutions. Without even one of them, like the path/cycle checking,
the runtime of the resulting search can get exponentially long. But of course, none of the search strategies will work
without a good heuristic function. I've learned through lectures and this assignment that building a good and considerate
heuristic takes a lot of thought for complex problems. For the sokoban problem alone, there were so many edge cases that
would terminate the search, I couldn't even get all of them because of the way robots have to move around the boxes, etc.
For the heuristic I built for this assignment, it is in no way monotonic or even admissible, but the rough estimates
I made to calculate the "true" distance for each box (using the obstacles/walls and the robot distance as factors), was
enough for me to get 14/20 on most of the tests. I guess this is reflective hard it is to get a perfectly good heuristic
function in real life.
