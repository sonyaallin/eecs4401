#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I have learnt in this assignment is the efficiency and speed
of FC and GAC on CSP problems. In the past I have used back tracking to solve regular 
sudoku I realized that it was extremely slow and I concluded that back tracking was almost 
pointless. After this class I have realized that implementation of propagators such as FC 
and GAC with MRV makes this problem so efficient. This entire idea of back tracking, FC, GAC 
is so fascinating and impresive. In addition to this the concept of FC and GAC was very well 
taught by prof sonya allin I was able to easy code FC and GAC. This was a very fun assignment 
to work on.
