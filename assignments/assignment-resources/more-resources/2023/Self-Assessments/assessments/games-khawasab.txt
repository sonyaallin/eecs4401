I cemented my knowledge that a good working model can be a solid foundation for
several things. For example, the model of having an initial state, a state
space, a set of actions, and a goal is a very good model for all kinds of
artificial intelligence and machine learning models. This is why we can apply
this model when doing a search problem but we can also apply it here in the game
problem.

As someone whose hobby is to develop games, I was hoping we might get to cover
an AI model for something like a robot in a first person shooter. While we may
not have covered it explicitly, I can apply the concept of taking one model and
applying it elsewhere to other areas of game development as well.
