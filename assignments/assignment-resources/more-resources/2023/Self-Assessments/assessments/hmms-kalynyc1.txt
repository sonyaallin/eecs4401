#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?
  
The most interesting part of the Bayesian Network module was the ability to sort of predict what
actions or situations led us to the current state using HMMs.  
Relatively easy we can construct HMMs for real-life scenarios and reduce the amount of
uncertainty behind different situations that led us to certain states.
Especially interesting was the assignment where we could get familiar with
very basic text recognition features.
