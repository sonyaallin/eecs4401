I learned many new things from the Bayesian Network module, however the most significant thing was 
seeing how much of a difference the right algorithm for a problem makes. For example, when doing 
the speech tagging assignment I first tried to go through the problem using different algorithms on 
paper with rudimentary examples. I first used a brute force approach to tag each each word, basically 
trying every possible combination and returning the path that gave the max probability. I recorded the 
time complexity and then tried the viterbi algorithm with the same examples and noticed a significant 
improvement in the time complexity. The viterbi algorithm pretty much removed paths that it knew it 
no longer needed while the brute force approach looked at every path.
