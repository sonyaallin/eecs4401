Learnt some pretty fancy game algorithm, and I
believe I can use these algorithm to beat my friends.
I think the minimax algorithm can be applied to a lot
of games, not just othello, some other like connect 4,
chess, tic-tac-toe, etc. If I have time, I want to implement
those heuristic functions for those different games. 
Also the optimization and the efficiency improvents are nice,
something like cacheing, ordering.. It's like trading space 
for time, and time is the most important in some cases..
Overall a very interesting topic and a very interesting assignment
since I really like playing games and implement them
