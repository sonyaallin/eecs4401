What is the most significant thing you have learned from the games module?

The most significant thing I have learned from the games module is how to program an AI to play a game by using minimax and alphabeta algorithms. Compared to the other assignments relating to game logic such as heuristics for Sokoban and constraints for Sudoku, I learned how minimax and alphabeta can be more universal. For Othello, it would be infeasible to create an AI based on constraints since there are little restrictions that would help the AI make a move, and heuristics would be difficult because each state may increase heuristic value but successive states may decrease heurisitic value. Using a recursive solution such as minimax and alphabeta is effective in determining moves because it gives a value to each move like heuristics and is not reliant on constraints, but also takes into account the game is played by two people.
