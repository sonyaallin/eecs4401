Before this unit, I hadn't realized how much of game AI can come down to human design as opposed
to training datasets like in machine learning. Heuristics make another appearance in this unit, 
and it reminds me that AI is more than just machine learning. We can actually apply strategies
that we would normally use while playing games in designing our game AI.

Alpha-beta search was really interesting. It becomes apparent really quickly that you need to
optimize these search algorithms, since search trees get really big really quickly. Being able to 
narrow down the tree in such a clever way was cool to learn.
