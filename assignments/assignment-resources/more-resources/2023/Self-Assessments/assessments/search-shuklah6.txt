I learned how to identify key characteristics of a problem and recurring problems that the algorithm suffered from,
which helped me in improving my alternate heuristic. As I went through each test case that I was failing, I saw all the
places where my alternate heuristic was failing and identified patterns that repeated through these cases
(for example, walls and other obstacles blocking the path of a box, a box hogging a storage which blocks
another storage location from being accessible, and others). Some of these problems I was able to work through, however,
some of these I struggled with for days, and I ultimately could not solve.
