#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant things I learned from the CSP module is how to form CSPs, 
and the several algorithms used to efficiently solve CSP problems. Through the 
final assignment of the module, I gained practical experience in constructing a 
CSP for a specific problem. This taught me how to create variables and constraints; 
and how to tie these elements together by determining all satisfying assignments
(of variables) and then adding these assignments and variables to the constraints. 
Ultimately, I have gained the confidence and technical ability to create CSP for 
several other types of problems. Furthermore, I have developed a complete understanding
of several CSP algorithms used to solve CSP problems such as Backtracking Search, 
Forward Checking and GAC. Both through the lectures and through implementing some 
of these algorithms on our assignment, I know understand how these algorithms work 
together and work with the elements of a CSP to solve a problem and provide some 
solution. Going forward, I believe I now have the capability of applying this 
knowledge to many other CSP problems.
