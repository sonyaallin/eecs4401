#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

Overall, I get how both GAC and FC check work but the implementation being asked of us in this assignment seems to be
confusing me in certain aspects. I learned that csp is very useful for finding solutions but comes at the cost of time
and depending on the implementation also space. This is shown in our assignment where the constraints contain tuples and
not a function that would return a true if the constraint is satisfied. I realised that this means that to create an
effective csp program one must be mindful of that and so it may be better in some cases to avoid implementing a csp
while in other cases it may significantly improve quality overall. Moreover, I feel like I wasnt able to implement what
I know in this assignment which shows me that you may understand how csp's work and what they do but implementing
requires more.
