#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?
I have learned he importance of having a good heuristic. Taking into consideration
a search's surroundings and how they impact the path to solution, has been eye opening.
As well, realizing when a search must end and when no possible solutions are available,
is a powerful tool that can be widely applied. This module has taught me to think
from multiple perspectives as opposed to just one. By doing so, a clear image of
the problem can be formulated allowing for better curated solutions. This module
has also shown me that different kinds of searches as better for different problems.
As well, it has shown me how there could be several different solutions to a problem
that lead to the same end result (i.e. reaching the bench mark, but having a different
solution).
