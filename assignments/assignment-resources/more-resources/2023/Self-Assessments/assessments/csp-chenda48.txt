What is the most significant thing you have learned from the CSP module?

The most significant thing I have learned from the CSP module is how to construct constraints for a CSP problem. For the domain of each constraint, I had to decide what the values are and how to assign them to the proper variables. In this problem, I also had to figure out how to get all possible tuples by finding a unique set of values that would satisfy the cage constraint, then permuting on each unique tuple. Without permuting, it is possible that a problem with a solution becomes unsolvable, because then it would be able to satisfy the binary/all-diff constraints. Initially, I was unable to solve the 3x3 because I did not account for permutations. Additionally, I did not consider duplicates within a cage constraint when variables are in different rows and columns, leading to not solving the 6x6 at first. Through these problems, I learned how to reason what values can be in the domain of each constraint to solve the problems.
