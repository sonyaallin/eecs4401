#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I saw many algorithms that help computers and AI win games against real users.
This gave me an insight on how the many games that I play that involve a computer
player operate. The most significant thing that I learned was how heuristics can
be used to make the AI make even smarter moves. For example, in this assignment
I made states that had the players pieces on walls or corners worth more, and 
this created an AI that was almost undefeatable. The cool thing is, there are
many other heuristics I could've incorporated to make the AI even smarter. This
is how computer games probably incorporate difficulty into the game.
