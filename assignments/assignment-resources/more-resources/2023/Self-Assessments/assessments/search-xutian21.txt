#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I learned is how to improve upon a solution that I developed just Like the iterative A* search. 
I found out that inorder to tackle the more difficult edge cases and improve efficiency, simply coding isn't enough. 
Through developing my heuristic, I ran into many obstacles and sometimes my improvements does nothing at all. 
In the end, many improvements that wored were developed through actually playing the game and trying to think like a computer.
I try to play the board in the worst way possible and putting the boxes in the worst positions.
This way I am able to translate it into my code and use heuristics to help the search algorithm to avoid tyhese situations.
