#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
From the games module I have learned how significant it is to have increase the
speed of the algorithm. As well, it is has shown me that increasing the speed of
the algorithm can be done in many ways. I have also learned that not taking into
account the stage in which the game is at or whether an opponent is not playing
optimally can impact the strength of the AI. However, the minimax algorithm is
the safe strategy for playing against almost all players whether they play optimally
or not. Lastly, the games module has shown me that we do not need compute the entire
tree in order to reach an optimal solution.
