Before completing this assignment, I had only a theoretical understanding of how forward checking and GAC works. But after implementing my own versions of forward these algorithms, I was able to gain a much stronger, practical understanding of how they work. In addition, by working with and debugging the program, I was able to appreciate just how much space a constraint table can take up. I found myself wanting to use an expression instead of supplying all valid assignments for constraints, and it made me gain a better understanding of the tradeoffs between choosing to use an expression and choosing to use a table / list of possible assignments.
