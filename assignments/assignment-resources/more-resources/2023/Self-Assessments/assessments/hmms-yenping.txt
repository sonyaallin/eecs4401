Self Assessment
What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?
The most significant thing I have learned from implementing A3 is the data preprocessing. After finishing A3, I find the hardest 
part of HMM should be the data preprocessing. The performance of HMM depends on the probability distribution definitions, but there 
are no specific rules of defining those probability distributions from the raw data. Although we do not have chance to gain experience
on data preprocessing from this assigment, the given training and test data serve as perfect examples for us to reference when 
we are actually dealing one in the future.
