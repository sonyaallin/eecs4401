The most significant thing I realized from this module was how we only need to need the previous state and the emmisions to guess the next 
state. Before this course I thought that things like Siri would have a database of words and pronounciations and would pick the
word with the most similar pronounciation. But the fact it uses HMMs makes way more sense and explains its accuracy since people pronounce
stuff differently but the rules of language remain fairly constant. But yea overall I think learning HMMs are really helpful since
I think it's really common and can help me create some cool side projects.
