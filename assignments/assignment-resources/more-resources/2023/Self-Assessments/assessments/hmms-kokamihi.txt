    The most significant thing I learned about HMMS and bayes nets (which HMM is a type of) is their widespread use and their versatility is usage across many different
    fields and applications. How they can be useful to describe and predict the evolution of models and events that are not directly observable.
    Their multiple applications interested me. From speech and handwriting recognition to POS like that we did.
    In terms of learning, learning how to implement and use a HMM was useful, while it was in python the general concept can be applied over languages and then be used in other applications.
