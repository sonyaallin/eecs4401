The most significant things I learned in the bayesian network module was how to 
design, implement and apply HMM models in order to solve real world problems. 
After having completed this module and the corresponding assignment I have 
now gained an understanding of how HMM models function, as in how these models 
are trained upon some training data to produce probability distributions which 
can then be used to make predictions on unseen/test data. Furthermore, I have 
also learned how inference algorithms such as the viterbi algorithm and variable 
elimination make predictions using probability. Through the assignment, I have 
also gained practical experience in designing, implementing and testing these 
models and algorithms. Where I learned how to adjust/manipulate algorithms in 
order to make more accurate predictions. This has given me a deeper understanding 
of uncertainty in event spaces and likelihood of events(and conditional probability). 
Ultimately, I believe I now have the ability to apply this knowledge in order to 
solve real world problems(such as POS-tagging) through the use of HMMs.
