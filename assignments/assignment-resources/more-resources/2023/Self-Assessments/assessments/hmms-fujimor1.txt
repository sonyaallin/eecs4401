One of the crucial things I learned from the Bayesian Network module is its versatility and usefulness in various industrial fields.

For instance, I was surprised that Bayesian Networks and HMMs are still widely used in the NLP field. In recent years, 
numerous Deep Learning-based models and Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches have emerged and taken over existing methods. 
Especially, DL models such as RNN and Transformers have become very popular that most of the engineers dive straight into 
these sophisticated models without considering more classical methods such as BN and HMMs. 
However, it turns out that these classic methods are as powerful as DL models in terms of predictability and generalizability. 
I'm amazed that our HMM model performs well with the POS-tagging task without overfitting to the training data. 
I would like to explore more about the practical applications of BN and how it can be applied to other 
sequential analyses such as time series modeling and computational finance.
