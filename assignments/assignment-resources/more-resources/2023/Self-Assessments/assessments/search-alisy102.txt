#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I learned a a great deal about how tiny factors like details about one's heuristic or 
the weight chosen for the f function for a star can have a huge impact on the performance
and speed of the search stats. It was very difficult to try and achieve a balance between
accuracy and speed of the heuristic function, but at the same time it was very rewarding as
I learned a lot of things about optimization and heuristics when trying to approach the problem.
For example, having an inadmissable heuristic by increasing the weight led to faster results
but a worse solution. Similarly a more accurate heuristic was not able to solve fast enough
but had a more optimal path to the solution.
