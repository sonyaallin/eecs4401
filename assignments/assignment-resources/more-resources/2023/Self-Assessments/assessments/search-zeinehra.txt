#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The search module taught me a lot about how ai algorithms find solutions. Heuristic functions
in particular, were very significant in reducing the time it takes to find solutions. Search
algorithms without heuristics can take a significant amount of time even with short depths
due to exponential complexity. For heuristic functions, the effectiveness of the heuristic
is crucial as it needs to allow an optimal solution to be found while still reducing the time
to find it. Thus, I found that the emphasis on a heuristic function to be the most significant
thing I learned from the search module as it entails the hardest detail (the skeleton
of the algorithms is the same across different problems while heuristics are unique to the
problem).
