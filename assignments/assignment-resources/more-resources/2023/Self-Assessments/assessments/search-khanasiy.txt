#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I think the most significant I learned from this assignment was that implementing algorithms that 
we've been learning for the past two years, isn't as hard as I thought. I also really enjoyed seeing first-hand
how complex time complexity is. There were points in the alternative distance code, where I wrote a function
that iterated through another set, but through it's findings I was able to cut down on overall runtime AND get
more accurate values. I really enjoyed this assignment, it seemed very scary in the beginning but after I 
started working on it I realized how simple it is.
