The most significant thing I learned from this csp module is the impact that the CSP search model is much more 
versitile and adaptable to the problem at hand, and thus has many real-life applicatons. Although they have 
different applications, it is much easier to apply the CSP model to a problem rather than search models geared 
towards finding optimal solutions like BFS or A* search. The CSP model can be generalized to any problem where 
the goal is not necessarily fast solutions, but instead just to find a configuration of variables that satisfies
the constraints, which can very helpful in schedule building and other types of organizational problems. Although 
performance is not a requirement of the search, I learned that simple improvements on the heuristics of the search 
(i.e. propogators or variable orderings) can have a positive impact on the efficiency of the search. This might be 
helpful in real-world applications if they are on a larger scale.
