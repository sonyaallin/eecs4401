What I learned from this assignment is how making artificial intelligent algorithms to play
games can be very hard and costly. It makes it more impressive that A.I. machines like
Deep Blue can beat the best Chess grandmaster at chess, especially since Chess is very complicated,
and AlphaGo even more so since Go has more moves than Chess. I see now that it's not enough to
follow a generic A.I. algorithm, but heurisitics will still play a big role in alpha-beta pruning
so that we expand the fewest amount of branches.
