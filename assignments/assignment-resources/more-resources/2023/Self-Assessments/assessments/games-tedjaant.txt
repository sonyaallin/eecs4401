#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The most significant thing that I have learned in the games unit is that both minimax
and alpha beta pruning are very expensive algorithms with a runtime of O(b^d). This was
made very apparent when this assignment ai struggles with a regular sized othello board.
With pruning, the runtime is able to be reduced by up to O(b^(d/2)), but it is still very
expensive. Many optimizations were added to this assignment to speed up computations as much
as possible such as caching states and node ordering, which helped cut down the computations.
However, it still leaves much to be desired for the future if a better algorithms are found to
solve these problems.
