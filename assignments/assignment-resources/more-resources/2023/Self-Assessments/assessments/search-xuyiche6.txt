#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

When listening to lectures about searching algorithms, they are all theories.
When I was doing this assignment, I actually found pseudocode in algorithm
is pretty different from codes in hands-on assignment.

The most important part is that accuracy is not all of the algorithm. When implementing
heur_alternate, it was a difficult time to find both efficient and accurate
way to implement it. Make it accurate enough will increase the complexity and thus does not
comply with the time limit. It was pretty interesting to explore and test though.

Besides, those weekly quizzes are very useful and helpful for me to summarize the week's learning.
For example, questions like finding out where the iteration terminates gives me opportunity to
practice the algorithm for different ways of searching.
