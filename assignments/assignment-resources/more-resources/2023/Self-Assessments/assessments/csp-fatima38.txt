#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

Both FC and GAC are effective algorithms for solving CSPs. FC can sometimes lead to incorrect assignments during its run
which causes a lot of backtracking. However, GAC is very powerful in its ability to prune so that less backtracking is
required and solutions are found faster. Still there are ways that even GAC can be improved to better its efficiency.
The idea of supports really helps reduce redundant assignment searches. I quite enjoyed learning about this module
because the logic puzzles I do mimic the csp problem setup, and it was interesting to see how a program could solve the
puzzle using some of the same logic that humans use but sometimes missing the obvious.
