#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I have learnt from the search module is the significance of
a good heuristic. Heuristics can greatly influence the decision making process for the
search and the optimality of the algorithm. Similarly to approximation algorithms,
heuristic algorithms prioritize speed over accuracy so when they are written well, they
are like a shortcut to the solution. There are no 'bad' heuristics, as a heuristic may
be optimal for one type of problem but are not effective for other problems. They really
make you think about your problem and all its edge cases and how far a certain state is
from the solution.
