#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I learned from the search module is that there isn't 
one type of search method that is good for all searches, there are different trade offs
to consider depending on the what you are searching like if there is a cost involved. 
Another thing I learned particuarly from working on this assignment is that 
its hard to come up with a good heuristic and theres a lot of edge cases to consider and 
sometimes adding more/certain constraints that seem like it would improve the heuristic will sometimes 
even make the search slower than how it was before. :(
