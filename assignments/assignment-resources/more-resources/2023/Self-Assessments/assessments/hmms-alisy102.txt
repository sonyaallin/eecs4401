This unit was one of the most enjoyable in the course so far especially since I tried to connect my learning with the world around me.
In fact, when we learned about Hidden Markov Models, one connection I was able to make was with the writing app that I use on my laptop.
This app is able to convert my handwriting to text. Perhaps, it also uses Hidden Markov Models for handwriting recognition.
This also leads to the most significant thing I learned from this unit which was that Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models despite being
simple can be used to represent relationships and make predictions about a wide variety of problems.
Despite them being simple, they are still really effective. This was emphasized to me in the assignment as I made tiny improvements
to my training tables and noticed huge improvements in prediction accuracy.
