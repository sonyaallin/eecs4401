#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?
The most significant thing I have learned from this csp module is the different ways we can improve our model and solve things much faster
with things like forward checking, back checking, etc. I also noticed that although binary check has much more constraints, it actually
solved it faster then n array ( probably due to the time and resources it takes to get all the possible permutations). I know learned 
why many AIs need high performance hard ware and resources to compute bigger problems, and that our current csp structure takes up a lot of 
resources in bigger problems.
