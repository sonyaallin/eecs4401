I learnt how AI is actually created in games between two players. I thought it was some magical, 
difficult thing but it turned out to be quite easy. The different algorithms show how efficiency 
plays such a big part in making an Ai usable for production. It is also interesting to see how cashing 
and ordering affect the program. Although I didn’t have the time to complete my own heuristic, I’ve 
thought of a few ways I would have done it and it truly was difficult to create something that was
both efficient and smart. Proper respect goes to the geniuses who create these cool heuristics!
