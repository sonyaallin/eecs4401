#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I particularly enjoyed learning about the minimax algorithm and the many improvements
we made to it while studying this topic. I remember doing coding questions online where I often
couldn't come up with a solution and often when I went to look for one people suggested running
minimax which I wasn't familiar with, therefore I found this topic even more enjoyable as it helped
me think of ways to solve those prior questions.
I also found the idea of making an intelligent player to player versus in a board game pretty cool,
back in csc148 we had to make a board game for Onitama game, in that we also made an AI but its
moves were programmed to be completely random as we weren't expected to make a functional player.
Its nice to see the progress made through assignments from first year to now, where we've made
a player that's moves are more thought out that just random chance.
