#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?
I learned many things in the Game section. One of them was that it can be
very expensive to create AIs to play games, because they need to traverse
through many if not all possible states to find the best move. This could be
seen in the A4, where solving Othello games larger than 4x4 becomes very
expensive to solve. I also found very interesting to learn about the minimax
algorithm, which takes into consideration two players, one that is trying to
win (maximize their utility) and one that is trying to not let the other win
(minimizing the other player's utility). This strategy was very fun to learn
because it shows the possible outcomes of the game when two players are
playing optimally, and the end we can find the final outcome of the game
and this can be easily visualized by using a Game Tree.
