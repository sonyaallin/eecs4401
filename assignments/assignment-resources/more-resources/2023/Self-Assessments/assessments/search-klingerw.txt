#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I think the different searching techniques is the most important thing I've learned. Intelligent search such as A star, weight A star, greedy best first search, uniform cost search, and the different heuristics that are used in tangent with some of these search methodologies. Heuristics in particular make a lot of sense now. They almost incentivize which states should be used during a search, and take advantage of knowledge of the search space, state space and its attributes. For example, during A1 we took advantage of the coordinates of robots, boxes, and storage, as well, I used obstacles and walls in my logic to prevent boxes from getting stuck. These generic but powerful search algorithms can be applied to any problem, given that you implement some functions (and a class like Sokoban) and implement your own heuristic. It really opens up what can be done with search to me, and I'm excited to apply it to my own personal projects!
