#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most important thing I learned from the csp module is that there are payoffs
between time and space efficiency. As we can see, in order to be time efficient
in something like GAC search, it means we have to store extra things and then
something like bookkeeping becomes an issue (something similar can be said
about FC search). However, with just regular BT search, it is pretty standard
with what you store (that being nothing) but it means that we are very slow
because we have nothing we can look forward on.
