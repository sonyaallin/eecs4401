The game module seemed super cool to me! Personally, I find the concept of
building your heuristic well by understanding and pondering about
strategies of how one can win the game extremely intriguing. For example, in Othello, how we can
segregate the calculations of heuristic depending on which phase you are in
(beginning, middle or starting) of the game. Moreover, I was interested in
how you used ordering, cache and depth-limits to allow the prunings and make your Ai even faster.
Later, I would love to develop my own agent for other two-player/multiplayer
player games such as chess, poker, ludo etc.
