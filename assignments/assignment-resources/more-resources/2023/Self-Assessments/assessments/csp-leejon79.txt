#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

One of the most significant things I've learned in this module is just how much faster
and better things can go by implementing constraints to the problem. On the surface,
the propagator functions are written/used for this assignment look terribly inefficient
and look like needlessly complicated work (they are O(n^3) or O(n^4) I believe), however
once implemented, the functions ran a lot faster than I anticipated. It's also surprising
how adding these constraints can reduce the need for complex heuristics, given the one
used in this assignment is infinitely simpler than the ones created for the previous
assignment. I also feel that overall, it's much simpler to implement and conceptualize a
proper problem-solving function with constraints with a simple heuristic function rather
than trying to make the solver just run some super all-encompassing heuristic to do everything
without constraints.
