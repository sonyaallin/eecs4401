#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I've learned from this module is the importance of understanding the problem. In the beginning,
I was very confused and I didn't know where to start. I had all the knowledge from class but i had no idea how to tackle
this assignment. However as I spent much time reading the starter code, The shape of a solution forms in my head. As a
result, I felt much more comfortable. This is because I understand how different classes work toGather to represent the
graphs and pseudocode we had in class. In the end I felt the work is actually easy because they represent what we've
learned in class in a very intuitive way.
