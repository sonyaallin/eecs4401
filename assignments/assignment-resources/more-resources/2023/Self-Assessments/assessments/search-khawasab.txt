#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

Before beginning, I thought Artificial Intelligence could only be acheived
through Machine Learning but it turns out this process of using search
algorithms is actually more logic based than mathematical based. I have found
that solving these kinds of problems is all about becoming well aquainted with
the problem and finding a good way of representing it. This enables you to
choosegood heuristics and, in turn, following a few logic steps, some
iterations and recursion, you can tell the computer to do all the heavy lifting.

To sum up, I've found that solving a problem becomes as simple as you make the
problem.
