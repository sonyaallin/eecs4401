#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I think I liked the idea of CSP search more than uninformed search problems since
it is more focused on the idea of finding a final solution for the problem while 
satisfying the given constraints for the problem. I also found it very interesting 
how we can improve our search by using propagators like forward checking or GAC, 
which restricts our problem domains, and removes obvious wrong domain values, thus 
improving our search path. I found this assignment very interesting since we work 
on real-life games or search problems like Soduku or variations like FunPuzz, which 
makes the overall learning process more fun and interesting.
