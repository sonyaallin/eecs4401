#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I learnt that adding an ordering heuristic makes a big differene in time taken to find a solution. 

Before I had added the ord_mrv heuristic, my forward checking could not complete the funpuzz model for the 6x6 
in automarker.py. It was also extremely slow for 5x5, it would take about 1 minute to solve. 
However as soon as I implemented ord_mrv, it found the solution very quickly. 

The intuition i learned is that with this particular heuristic, variables with the smallest domain are locked in place 
before we go on to try other variables with much larger domains. This means that in many cases we decrease the search space
significantly by prioritizing the locking down of the variables that are easy to assign a value for.
