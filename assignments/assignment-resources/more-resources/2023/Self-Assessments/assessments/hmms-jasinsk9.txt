The most important I learned this assignment was not to procrastinate and lose motivation...
Seriously though, the most important I learned was the power of probability. It seems like such a
simple tool: "How likely is this to occur?" But when you combine it with training data, 
multiple, conditional and joint probabilities you can create a complicated that is amazing at
predicting certain things. I also worked a lot with probability is CSC311 last semester and it
still amazes me how well it works. I also read up on the application a hidden Markov model has in
cryptanalysis. I'm not in info security but the base level decoding is super cool and its crazy that
probability can help decrypt something. Most of the stuff is too high level for me but still, pretty
awesome.
