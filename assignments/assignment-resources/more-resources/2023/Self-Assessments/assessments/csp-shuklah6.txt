#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

In the beginning I was testing FC and GAC with binary_ne_grid and nary_ad_grid since I didn't have funpuzz
solver finished. My tester was not able to solve CSP6 with nary_ad and FC, and when it did with other combinations of
propagators and grids it took much longer than a second to solve. I thought the problem lied in FC, but after hours
of trying to debug I gave up - I exactly followed the lecture's pseudocode and I still couldn't get it to work. In order
to salvage some marks I decided to finish funpuzz, turns out once I got a functioning funpuzz generator everything
worked. This led me to the conclusion that I had too few constraints in the case I failed, which made the grid too
open ended and impossible to solve in a reasonable/fast time (I was waiting for upwards of 5 minutes for my algorithm to
solve before I finished funpuzz and it still would not finish running).
