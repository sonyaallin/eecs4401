What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

Well, perhaps the most significant thing I learned was Bayes' Theorem. Technically, I knew this theorem already, but I had mostly forgotten it.
And I certainly never learned its significance.
However, I did not understand the intuition behind the theorem until it became the backbone of Bayes Nets.
The way that it allows us to abstract a hypothesis and the role of evidence is incredibly useful. I learned thoroughly that
evidence should update our beliefs, not just change them. I have a deeper appreciation for this theorem now.

I also learned that HMMs really are everywhere. Siri was originally built on HMMs and even now, she is just an HMM supplemented with 
deep neural networks and LSTMNs. They are used to predict the weather and guide robots. I never even thought that mars rovers would be using ai.
I assumed they were simply being guided based off visual data, however, the vast distances obviously make direct control all the time impractical.
The level of abstraction that HMMs give allows so many problems to be formulated in their terms.
