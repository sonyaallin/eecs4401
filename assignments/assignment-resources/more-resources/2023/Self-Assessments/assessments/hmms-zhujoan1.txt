What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

The most significant thing I learned from the Bayesian Network module is that probability is everywhere.
And every decision we make depends on what happened in the past like HMMs. And it also gave me an idea on 
how speech recognition and machine translations work. And for them to produce information with high accuracy, 
a lot of past data must be accumulated and transformed to probably train the models. And the more data there is, 
the better the model. If there isn't much data, then it will have to make a lot of predictions with no strong 
evidence which can potentially give us inaccurate information.
