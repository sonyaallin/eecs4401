What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

I guess the most significant thing I've learned from Bayesian Networks is that
it's not that difficult to predict. There's always a lot of hype about the
intelligence behind prediction but it all comes down to algorithm and algorithm
design. It also made me realize that this prediction can get better, as humans
evolve and time goes on, it'll only get easier to predict outcomes since our
datasets just keep growing. Very cool and very interesting.
