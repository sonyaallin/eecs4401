#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I learned from the csp module is how to generalize a problem.
Many problems can be broken down into a list of constraints and variables, so this approach can
help me formalize various problems with the same strategy.
I also learned that staying up late to work on code is unadvisable. My automarker was not
matching the automarker_output.txt, and I did not notice for a very long time. I was missing some of
the combinations of binary constraints, which allowed some incorrect assignments to occur.
Although I was able to refactor some of my code to make it faster, but I could not get it fast enough 
for GAC and FC to work for 6x6 grids. I'm not sure what I'm missing in making it more efficient.
