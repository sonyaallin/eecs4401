What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?
The most significant thing I learned from the Bayesian Network module was how we can use probabilities and
statistic strategies to solve real world problems. Bayesian Networks give us a model to view and easily understand
certain statistical problems, allowing us to deploy certain strategies, like Hidden Markov Models. Creating graphical models
of statistical problems made them much easier to understand and allowed me to understand the assignment much better. Furthermore,
prior to this assignemnt conditional probability problems was something I found confusing and often struggled with, but
Bayesian networks helped a great deal in my understanding.
