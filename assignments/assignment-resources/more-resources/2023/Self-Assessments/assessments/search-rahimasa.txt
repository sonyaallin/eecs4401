#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?
The learned a lot from this module. One of the things I learned is making even a tiny change to a
heuristic can result in a drastically different search. But the most significant thing I learned was
the importantce of not complicating a heuristic. I implemented a solution that would push a box into a storage
and move any boxes neccessary and limit it to one box per storage and made sure to keep track of all that data. 
However that solution got less cases right than my BFS solution and my Manhatten solution. This is because
by putting so many constraints we are limiting what can actually be called a good state and we make it harder for 
the search.
