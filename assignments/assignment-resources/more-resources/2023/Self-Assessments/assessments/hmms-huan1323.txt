What have we learned about Bayesian Networks?  Have you discovered that HMMs are
everywhere?  Will you ever look at Siri the same way?  Help us understand by
answering the following question in 100-250 words:

What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

The Bayesian Network basically connect the different processes of an event by
the conditional probability. First, it needs some training data to create the
CPT tables, which are the prior, transition and emission matrixes. For instance,
the NLP analysis the words on POS tagging. From a lot of given sentences, we are
able to observe the behaviors of different tags and words in the sentences.
After the training, we can form the HMM model for the testing sentences and
provide an analysis base on the maximum probability. However, there can still be
mistakes in our analysis. Since the maximum probability have no guarantee, the
HMM models are better to be used in some fields that allows mistakes. In
addition, we need a huge amount of training data to keep our CPT table accurate.
Therefore, we should be able to observe some significant rules in the past data.
For instance, Siri, weather prediction and markets are some suitable fields for
the HMM models. We can observe the rules in human actions on cellphone to
construct Siri. For weather prediction, we are able to analyze the rule of
weather in past days. Also, the customers deals implies some rules for the market
and HMM models can help us to predict the future trend.
