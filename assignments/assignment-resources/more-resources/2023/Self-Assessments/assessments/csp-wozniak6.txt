#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I learned that there are different methods of search functions, which not just focus on path. For example, CSP searches
focus on constraint satisfaction rather than paths. They care only about providing a solution rather than an optimal one
. I learned that There are many different ways of implementing CSPs. The most effective method is an ARC consistency
enforcer. You can also use heuristics in order to improve performance of CSP searches, similar to earlier searches we
performed. More naive methods of CSP include CSP backtracking. CSP forward tracking can be greatly improved with an
MRV heuristic. Up to 10,000 times better!!!
