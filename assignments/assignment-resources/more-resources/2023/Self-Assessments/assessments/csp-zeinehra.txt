#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

    CSPs, at first, seemed very similar to searching. They involved finding solutions with
certain restrictions so it seemed pointless to separate the two. However, after learning the
material well, I saw some major differences (they still have some similarities though). One
major difference that I found very significant about CSPs is how abstract it can be. The
algorithm behind CSPs can be implemented to any CSP problem. For example, in this assignment,
FC and GAC algorithms were implemented without ever referencing anything related to the
problem itself. It is only the constraints themselves that are unique to the problem.
    In addition, I found the complexities of such algorithms to be scarily large (search
algorithms shared this problem). In order to combat such complexities, shrinking the domain
through algorithms (like FC and GAC) was very effective. The effects of such algorithms were
rather surprising as the algorithms themselves seemed rather complex.
