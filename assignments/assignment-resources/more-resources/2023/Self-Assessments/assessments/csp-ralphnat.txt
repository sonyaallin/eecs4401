#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I learned from csp was how csp functions work. Specifically, how constraints
are necessary and how the changing of them can affect how a function works. When doing this assignment, I often had to
analyze the csp module in order to find inspiration for my ideas. Furthermore, I also learned how these problems
can be applied to real life scenarios, such as solving a Sudoku puzzle, where the efficiency of your solution matters
greatly, and if the solution is not efficient/ideal, there are great consequences. Overall, I learned many things which
will definetely help in my Computer Science related studies and careers.
