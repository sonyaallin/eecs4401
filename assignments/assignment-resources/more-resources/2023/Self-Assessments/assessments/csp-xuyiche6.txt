#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

In my opinion, solving a CSP problem is like finding an equilibrium for all questions where each question is satisfied, just like parents taking care of babies.
For this assignment, it is pretty annoying and time consuming that when implementing the three models, it took me a lot of time finding out why there were all None in solution and why my code entered with DWO.
As the way I implemented the funpuzz_csp_model, I chose to use binary non equal, which is easier for me to understand and it also gives me better performance.
From this module, the most important thing i learnt is the constraint propagation, which is Generalized Arc Consistency.
Similar to forward checking, it can detect conflict earlier than FC and therefore saves us run time.
