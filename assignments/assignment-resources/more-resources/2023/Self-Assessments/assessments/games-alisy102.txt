#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

I really enjoyed this unit since I've always enjoyed playing video games and 
developing an AI bot that could play by itself and against others was very rewarding. 
In fact, I have always tried to come up with the best strategies when playing 
games on my own, but thinking about different strategies to win in Othello when 
developing my own heuristic made for a really good learning experience. Moreover, 
this whole course has really taught me the importance of heuristics and how they 
can influence the outcome of the whole algorithm. This was emphasized when I saw 
drastic improvements in my agent's performance as I incorporated different strategies 
into the heuristic. This unit also revealed how assuming the best moves from the opponent 
is also essential with the min max algorithm.
