#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

Mostly I learnt how to win games. Since we spent so much time on predictions of
success, it feels like now I know a new method in mastering certain games simply
by completing them the way we would expect to find solutions. I learnt about the
min-max and alpha-beta methods and I'm honestly excited to see how many other
games I can work on in this way and automate a computer opponent.
