#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The main thing I learned was that it is harder than I expected to make a very good heuristic. I managed to make one that was decent rather quickly
but trying to make it solve all 20 in under 2 seconds was more complicated than I anticipated.

Another significant thing I learned was how small details really impacted performance of the algorithms. I had under 14 solved in 2 seconds for both 
iterative weighted a star and iteravtive GBFS until I moved a singular if statement out of the main loop and it suddenly became all 20 in under 2 
seconds. There were other improvements to speed I had done before but they didn't impact the result directly and it was the if that tipped the
scale which was really cool to see.
