As mentioned in the first unit, most of AI can be reduced to a search algorithm. This
is probably more similar than both probability and CSPs. I also find, atleast for
othello, that it's really hard to come up with a heuristic for the game. It's easy to
think of just the difference in material that results in socre, but as with othello, 
just because you're genearlly leading in score doesn't mean that you will be in a few 
turns. Also, once you have a postition that is better, but not fully represnetable
as a score value, how can you diffrentiate that in the heuristic to be better than 
a similar state, with same score, but a worse position. For my example, it's if you 
control the corners, as those cannot be turned. If I control a corner, how many more
points in the heurisitc should I recieve?
