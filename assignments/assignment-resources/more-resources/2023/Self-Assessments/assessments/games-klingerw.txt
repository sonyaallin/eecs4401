I learned about the idea of two player games and the strategies behind them, particularily minmax and alphabeta, which make use of seeing into future decisions 
and making best choices in hopes to worsen the opponents possible moves or increase our scores for our own moves. This assignment taught me a lot on the 
roles of minmax, and the use of heuristics at the end was a nice tie and nod to the beginning of the semester. The recursive nature of minmax and alphabeta
makes sense as well, as each recursion is taking a step down a level of the tree, into an internal node or leaf node and deciding the best action to take in the mind
of either the opponent or the player.
