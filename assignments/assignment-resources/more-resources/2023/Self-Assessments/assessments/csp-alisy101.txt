#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I learned how there are different types of propagation algorithms and how they can be optimized
by using different variable ordering heuristics. These propogation algorithms with a backtracking algorithm can
help us solve complex problems such as finding the right set of values for a soduko game in a matter of
seconds, when it would take the average human hours to do. Furthermore, from this assignment I can see
how important it is to create good constraints as they can greatly impact the ability of a problem to be solved
and even the time complexity. Overall, This showed me how important constraint search
problems are in the field of artifical intelligence.
