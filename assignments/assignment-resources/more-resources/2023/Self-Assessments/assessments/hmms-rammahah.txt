When I previously thought about AI a big part of it involved the idea of 'training' a model and using it to predict certain values. 
Learning about Bayesian Networks allowed me to get a better understanding of how this model is created and how it is used. This assignment 
allowed me to further understand the concept of HMMs because it allowed me to understand each distribution in the HMM model and how it is 
used. When it comes to HMMs it was also interesting to learn about emission values. I always thought predictions were based only on the 
patterns observed. Emissions are basically extra variables that are used to improve predictions and when you think about it, it makes 
sense. For example, when using Siri, it uses the words that you say to make predictions, but it might also use, for example, your location 
as an emission value.
