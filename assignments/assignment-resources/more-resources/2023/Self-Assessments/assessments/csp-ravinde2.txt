#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I think this has given me some perspective on how logical programming might function. I did logical programming
in CSC324 for a proof solver and I feel it is likely that logical programming uses something similar to csp 
since logical programming is completely focused around setting contrainsts and finding values that satisify them. 
It is really facsinating to see a concept I did in another course get more fleshed out in this course. It has gotten me
curious now if I got write my own very basic logical programming language with an interpreter written in python. I'm also 
curious about writing a csp in a logical programming language as it feel it would be a lot easier to setup the contraints
and find satisfying values.
