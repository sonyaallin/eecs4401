#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

Constraint propagators are the most significant thing I learned, especially GAC. 
Propagating the constraints and pruning values without "searching" the variable
tree can be really usefull, and I personally think that the ability to prune impossible
values from the very begining of the problem could prove to be really usefull in other
problems, reducing the time complexity of solving these problems significantly. I learnt
how to implement this algorithm, by using a queue to keep track of all the constraints that
might prune a value from a variable's domain, by adding all the constraints that affect
a variable that has been pruned by a previous constraint.
