What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module?

The most significant thing I've learned from the Bayesian Network module is that humans use statistics (learned and innate) 
to help make informed decisions. This same principle extends to AI. Using conditional probabilities helps determine the 
liklihood of certain options being correct, in the same ways humans do. When it comes to langauge semantics specifically, as seen
with the Parts of Speech Tagging, there are always exceptions to the rule, and babies often make the mistake of 
overregularizing or underregularizing rules because they're following the probabiliities in their brains after being exposed
to a training set of lanugage their whole life. A lot of components of life like langauge and decision making, rely on statistics.
