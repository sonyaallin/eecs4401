I learned how AI such as Stockfish and AlphaZero work. Instead of analyzing every single possible game state which
will be far too computationally expensive than feasible, we use logic and strategies that have been developed by
humans over centuries to guide our program. I also realized how we can make the AI more or less challenging
depending on the complexity of our guiding heuristics.
More specifically, I learned about minimax selection and alphabeta pruning. With minimax, on the assumption that our
opponent picks the most optimal move on each turn, we used the logic that by removing the best options for the opponent
through our moves can result in higher chances of us winning the game.
AlphaBeta pruning allows us to narrow our search criteria to improve runtimes, by only allowing the algorithm to explore
better or worse moves than the ones we've already found.
