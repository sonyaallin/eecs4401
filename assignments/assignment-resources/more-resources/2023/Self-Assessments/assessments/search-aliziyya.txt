#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I think I've learnt a lot about how the different search algorithms can be implemented. Looking at the
starter code alone, the way the code is designed is so modular and incorporates many different forms
of searches while also facilitating costs, weights, etc. I also found out that the size of a problem 
correlates to the search heuristic time. For the alternate heuristic, it was interesting to see that as 
the problem got larger; the more complicated things are. Even handling obstacles in a smaller setting
is very complicated as you must consider all the different scenarios where things can go wrong.
