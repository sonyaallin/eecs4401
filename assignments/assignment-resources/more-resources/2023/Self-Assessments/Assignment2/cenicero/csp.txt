I learned from the Constraint Search Problems is the way they differ from the path-finding search problems
that was introduced in Sokoban. We can save a lot of space from not having to remember the paths and only
concerning ourselves with the end configuration, and we can use heuristics slightly differently where in this
case we use a heuristic to pick the next variable to attempt to configure.
I also learned a great deal about pruning in the propagators and how they will greatly affect the runtime of
the search algorithm. I ran the Backtracking algorithms with and without the minimal degree heuristic and
the runtime difference was very significant.
