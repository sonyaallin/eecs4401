#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

From the csp module, the most significant thing I have learned is that when dealing with csps, efficiency and
speed matters. When doing backtracking search, we can use propagators to look forward at the next decision and use
some logic to determine ahead of time which assignments will not lead to solutions. This will prevent us from going into
and expanding that solution, and will save alot of time. Also, we can use order heuristic to assign variables that
lead to skinny trees, meaning less expansion and more depth. Using all these techniques, will improve the overall
runtime and make previously untractable problems solvable. Hence, speed is one of the most important things when it
comes to csp problems.
