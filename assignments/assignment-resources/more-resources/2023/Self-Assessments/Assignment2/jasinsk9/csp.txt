#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?
The most significant thing I have learned from this assignment is how much better GAC checking
is than forward checking. It is crazy to see that just from checking all constraints no matter
how many unassigned variables there are in them instead of if there is only one, that drastic
drop in number of variable assignments and pruned variables. On the 6x6 starter grid, forward
checking results in 15000ish variable assignments and 6900 pruned values while GAC only assigns
an exact 36 variables one for each square and prunes 179. Literally 0.2% of the previous amount
of assignments. This really shows how even what seems like slight optimizations can really change
the performance of your algorithm. While investigating CSPs I also learned that CSPs can be used to
generate composition and harmonizations in music theory while taking into account fingering or
melody. I was always told you could combine any two majors you want and find something to do in
post-secondary but music and computer science seems like a stretch and even still you can find
something like this that combines two radically different subjects.
