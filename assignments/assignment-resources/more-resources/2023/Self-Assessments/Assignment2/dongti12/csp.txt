#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

From the constraint search propagtion module, I learned more in depth about a goal oriented algorithm for a search
problem. From 324, we ended the course with miniKaren I always wanted to know how it was implemented,
with what BT, FC, GAC and the use of degree/MRV heuristics, it's fascinating how much time you  can save.
I learned that with propagators, its a way of pruning useless states in the upcoming search operation so that you don't
have to check the constraints when you get there which saves a lot of time. But it doesn't always save time since
it can make things worse by doing checks that results in no pruning. But in reality, it pretty much always saves time,
but that's just the thing with NP complete problems.
