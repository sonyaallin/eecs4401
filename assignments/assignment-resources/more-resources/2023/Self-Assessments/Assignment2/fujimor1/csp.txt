#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

One of the significant things I learned from the CSP module is the importance of choosing the right propagators and constraints. 

First of all, I was astonished by how the choice of propagators results in a significant difference in runtime. 
For instance, when I was playing with the code and intentionally commented out the initial propagation, the runtime increased dramatically. 
Moreover, using GAC or Forward Checking rather than the plain backtracking algorithm as a propagator resulted in much less runtime. 

Secondly, I learned the importance of how we construct the constraints and how they can affect time efficiency. 
For example, the search time became faster when using n-ary all-different constraints instead of binary all-different constraints.
