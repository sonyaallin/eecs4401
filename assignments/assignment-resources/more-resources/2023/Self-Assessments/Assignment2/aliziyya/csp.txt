#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I learnt how important constraints are and how useful they can be for AI purposes. They 
provide lots of optimization to search algorithms. I also learnt that they're an absolute 
pain to create and ensure if they're all correct. Regardless, they are very important. I also
learnt that there are many different ways to make small optimizations to those programs. Most 
are influenced or derived from the way humans think about solving a problem. This is seen in 
mrv! In addition, it is crazy to see how those optimizations improve runtime. Talking about runtime, 
its also cool to see how long things actually take to be solved by an AI.
