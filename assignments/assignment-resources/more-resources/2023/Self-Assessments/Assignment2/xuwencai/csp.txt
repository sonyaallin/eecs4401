#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

Well, I already know the backtracking algorithm one or two years ago when I was practicing leetcode, to solve
those permutations, combinations question, and I know backtracking is kind of a brute force solution.
After learning this module, I know a lot of ideas to improve on it, forward checking, GAC, MRV, etc.
The most significant one is propagation, Propagation has to be applied during the search, potentially at every node of the
search tree, and if the propagation itself is slow, then it won't help, it will slow 
down the entire search tree. So algorithm is the most important, if you pick the correct 
algorithm, then it will save you a lot of time.
