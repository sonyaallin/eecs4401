#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing that I have learned from the csp module is that
there are no one fit all algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems. We
were introduced to some algorithms that take advantage of key intuitions to
cut down the searches where each new one was on average better than the rest
but can still have cases where they are significantly worse. For example,
forward checking is about 100 times faster than backtracking, but it also has
the possibility to do worse than backtracking given such an edge case. Each
problem needs careful consideration of how each algorithm takes shortcuts so
that a goal can be found from the search efficiently.
