#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing that I have learnt from the csp module is the different ways (Forward
Checking and Generalized Arc Consistency) we can prune the domain of variables to efficiently 
reach the solution to a given CSP problem.

Forward Checking Propagation only checks constraints with a single unassigned variable and checks
if there exists at least one value in the domain of the variable that satisfies the constraint. If not,
then it prompts the CSP algorithm to backtrack.

Generalized Arc Consistency Propagation prunes the domain of variables if it does not satisfy all of the
constraints that apply to it. If the domain of a variable is pruned, then it rechecks all previously
checked constraints against the newly pruned domain to see if it still satisfies them. If a domain wipeout
occurs then it prompts the CSP algorithm to backtrack.
