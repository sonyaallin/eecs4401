#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I learned from the CSP module is to construct clear constraints. When working on funpuzz_csp.py, 
I strongly realize how important it is to have explicit constraint definitions in CSP, and discover the complexity while implementing
the constraint tuples. The critical point of constraint construction for this assignment is the "order". The variable order of 
constraints and the value order of satisfying tuples are the two most important orders of constraint definition. Also, when constructing 
the satisfying tuples, whether there exists repeated values should also be considered. Forward cheking and GAC enfore apply to all CSPs,
but each CSP has their own constraint definition, and thus indicating that one of the most important things of CSPs are their unique 
constraint definitions.
