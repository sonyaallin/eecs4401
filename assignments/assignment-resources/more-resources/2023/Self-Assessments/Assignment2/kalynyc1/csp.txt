#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

Most interesting part of the CSP module was the practical application of the theory.
How relatively easy we can solve complex puzzles like sudoku, queens problem and etc. where 
each step involves some sort of constraint in the big picture.
Most significant part was the GAC-based pruning technique.
Very powerful technique as it considers all CSP problems on each step.
