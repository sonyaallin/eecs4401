#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

csp module provides the search with efficiency mostly depends on domain
Normal BT search has no consideration for domain, result in a fat and long ass search tree.
However, with FC, it reduces the possibility of assigning domain. Which increase efficient.
And last, GAC, reduce domain and reduce size of search tree, which can highly improve from the backTracking
search. Conclusion, csp module will be fast if pruned value in domain.
