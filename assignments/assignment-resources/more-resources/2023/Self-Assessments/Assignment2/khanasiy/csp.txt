#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I've learned through this module is that although we've learned quite
a few searching methods, they build on one another. Even when writing code, it's easy to spot similarities
and it make it even more clear how much faster one can be. It's also just fun to compare this module to 
the last one and see each methods applicability based on whether the paths are necessary or not.
