#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

This module showed me how various real-life problems can be solved by converting them
to a CSP. When completing this assignment, I realized when running FC using n-ary constraints
that it is possible for FC to take exponentially longer to solve a CSP compared to GAC.
Whereas, GAC checks all constraints which results in a lot more pruning and a narrower search tree
which explains how it reaches a satisfactory solution quicker. 

Furthermore, I realized when implementing the cage constraints why pre-processing checks for 
consistency are beneficial as it allowed me to detect issues with my constraint implementation
prior to the search even running, which saved a lot of time.
