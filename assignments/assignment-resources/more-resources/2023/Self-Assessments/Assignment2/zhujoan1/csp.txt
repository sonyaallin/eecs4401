#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The most significant thing I learned from the csp module is that forward checking is not always better than
backtracking though it might seem like it, and forward checking is even faster if performed with heuristics. 
And also there are many ways to represent the types of constraints in the problem as in the assignment. 
The constraints of a problem can be presented using binary constraints and/or higher order constraints, 
and they are computed with similar methods. And from the assignment, using libraries like itertools 
is a lot easier to compute the permutations compared to writing all the code on your own.
