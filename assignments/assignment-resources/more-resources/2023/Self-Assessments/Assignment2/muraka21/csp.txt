#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?
The most significant thing that I learned in the CSP module is forward checking,
because I learned how looking forward in the problem can reduce by a lot the
number of tries that is required to solve a search problem. The key thing about
FC that I found genius is the pruning of values because it provides information
about the paths that should not be taken as they will lead to a deadend.
Therefore, I think that the concept of looking ahead to avoid undesirable
results is the most significant thing I have learned in the CSP module.
