#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

The CSP module's most important/significant topic to me was actually being able to build the environment, establishing variables, constraints, and their scopes.
Learning about how we build CSPs in the game Sudoku during lecture made it easier to understand working with funpuzz, and now I believe that I could implement
a CSP problem for other board games which require different sets of game constraints with variables over iterative states like we would see in the previous search 
module. Leaning about Forward Checking as well as GAC was also very useful, especially implementing the functions, which allowed me to discover how to work around the 
constraints (although being given the CSPbase.py file made things very helpful). Overall, I would say this project (including A1 for it's module) really helped me understand
what everything meant, as it forced me to learn about the pieces in order to put it all together. The past two assignments have been structured very well!
