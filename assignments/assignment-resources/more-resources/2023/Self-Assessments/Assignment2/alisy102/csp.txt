#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the csp module?

I really enjoyed this module in the course especially since CSP's were new to me.
It was really fascinating to see how incorporating all the different techniques to the 
original backtracking search algorithm was able to improve the time complexity 
of the overall search. Some significant things that I was able to learn and confirm
through the assignment was that forward checking does improve on backtracking for the most
part and similarly GAC improved on forward checking when it came to time of the search.
Furthermore, I remembered from tutorial that binary constraints tend to be better than 
nary constraints since they are less expensive to compute. At the time, I just assumed this to 
be true but had a hard time confirming if it was true. But after doing the assignment, i was really
intrigued to test different nary constraint implementations against binary constraints and i tested
how binary constraints would perform against trinary...nary constraints. In the end, it confirmed the
original hypothesis that for the most part that the binary constraints implementation had a 
faster search.
