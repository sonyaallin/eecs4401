#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I have learned is that when programming a heuristics algorithm,
making optimistic calculations is never desirable because most of the times you will get wrong
estimation.
Therefore, we need to aim for more realistic results. However, in order to get a good estimation,
we need to take a lot of edgecases and situations into consideration. For example, when programming
heur_alternate() function I took into consideration heuristics of the path of each robot to the boxes that
were closest to them. Then, I checked if the boxes were trapped on the map - because in that case there is no point 
to proceed since there will be no solution. Making sure that each box must be stored at individual storage location was
another constraint. 
In order to get the best estimate we need to take as many as possible situations.
