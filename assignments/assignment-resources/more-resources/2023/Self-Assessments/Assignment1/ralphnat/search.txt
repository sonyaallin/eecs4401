#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I learned from the search module was how to implement proper search functions.
In particular the search module helped immensely with weighted_astar and iterative_weighted_astar. Initially, I
wasn't  sure how to approach these problems, but after looking at the search module I was able to see how search
functions were supposed to be used and their helpful and necessary methods. The search module also hepled me understand
the assignment handout better. In the handout, things such as pruning, costbound, etc. were mentioned and not clarified,
but after reading through the search.py I was able to understand what these meant and why they were important. This
helped me implement my iterative functions.
