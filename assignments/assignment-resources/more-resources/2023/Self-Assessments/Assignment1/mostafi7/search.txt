#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing that I have learned from the module is the importance of a
well made heuristic. The heuristic is basically the brain of the AI. 
Making a heuristic too large and complicated only "clouds" up the AI's "thinking". 
So outside the box thinking has to be used to create better heuristics. 
Heuristics can always be made better but making them better requires quite a bit of thought.  
One more thing that I took away was a deeper understanding and appreciation of how beautifully 
complicated these programs can be. Which gave me a tremendous respect to the people who originally 
came up with such ideas and innovation.
