The most important thing that I learned from this assignment is the importance of heuristics. I understood the content, but until implementing both search functions and the molding my heuristic, it really sinked in how a heuristic affects the outcome of a search. By simply adding a bad check to my heuristic, my search results tanked compared to when I removed that check. I also realized how hard it is to make a heuristic better past a point. It was tricky making the heuristic good to begin with, but getting it over a certain point is even harder. A heuristic can really make or break the efficiency of a search.
