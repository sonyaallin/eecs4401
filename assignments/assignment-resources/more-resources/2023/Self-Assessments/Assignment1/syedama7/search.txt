#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?]]

The most significant thing I have learned is that there are many different ways to search
that have pros and cons. Even the most straightforward and seemingly efficient searches can
take longer times than more complex searches such as BFS being worse (on average) then IDA.
I have also learned that there are many variations of searches such as A* search that can have
different results. Iterative A* search can be used to find a good weight and make the most optimal
choices. Weighted search also helps to combine the heuristic value with the g value to produce a 
more accurate search. The hardest part for me is finding a good heuristic function. To choose a good
heuristic function, it must be both admissible and monotonic. The closer the heuristic is to the 
optimal function, the better. However it is hard to do this, since we just want
an estimate and also don't want to take too long.
