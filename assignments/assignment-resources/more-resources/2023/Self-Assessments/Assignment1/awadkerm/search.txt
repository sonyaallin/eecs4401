In the search module I learned about heuristics. Going into the module,
I thought I already knew what we were learning (because we started with
search methods like BFS and DFS). However, after going through the entire
module, I learned that while the importance of BFS and DFS cannot be
overstated, they are not incredibly useful in helping an agent search
through an environment. The reason for this is that they provide no
indication of which direction might contain the goal. They simply search
in an unopinionated manner. Heuristic searches are almost mandatory,
since they provide the agent with the "intelligence" needed to find the
goal in a timely manner (assuming a good heuristic of course).
