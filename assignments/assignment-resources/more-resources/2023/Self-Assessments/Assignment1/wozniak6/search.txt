#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?
The most significant thing I have learned in this module, was the idea and concept of heuristics. Up until now, I always
thought that searches had to be brute force, and would check every possibility. Now I understand that searches can be
optimized with heuristics. I also learned ways of implementing, and analyzing said heuristics.I also learned different
ways of using heuristics, as there are different forms of search functions which can weigh heuristics in different
schemes. I learned the properties of these different schemes and how they affect the performance of a search function.
I also gained an appreciation for how difficult it is to implement a proper heuristic. It is not as easy as it looks
sadly.
