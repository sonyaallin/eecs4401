#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

From doing this assignment, I learned how difficult it is to come up with an improved heuristic function. 
This was my main lesson because it was counterintuitive to sink more time into the calculation of the Heuristic 
function so that you can account for more variables so that the improved heuristic can reduce the overall runtime 
of the search algorithm. Initially, I tried changing the way I measured distance between the boxes, though it didn’t 
give much of an improvement at all, but increasing the number of things I accounted for yielded a great improvement.
So I learned that heuristics need not be novel things, but we can incrementally better them carefully while taking
into account the overall runtime of the heuristic. I also learned how useful caching and hashing is for speed savings.
Though the way I implemented it takes worst case up to every state on the board, which is exponential memory cost.
Perhaps in other attempts, I’ll figure out a way to reduce the overall memory cost for hashing, and storing previous states.
