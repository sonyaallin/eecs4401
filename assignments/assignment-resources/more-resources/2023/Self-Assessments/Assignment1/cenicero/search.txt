I think the most important thing is that you can't have a heuristic that does
everything for you. No matter what, it will be slow on some edge cases and you
can't make it fast without introducing other slow cases.
Also, you can see intuitively how you would solve the puzzle, but it is
hard to express the amount of moves it would take to do that.
You have an intuitive idea oh how you yourself would solve the puzzle,
but it is hard to "design a magnet" so the AI does what you would do.
Such as placing boxes in order, using certain robots if they are closers,
making sure you don't trap any boxes. I have a bigger understanding
about this now.
