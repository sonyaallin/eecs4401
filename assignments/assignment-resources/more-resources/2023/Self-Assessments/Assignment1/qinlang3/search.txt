#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I found that most significant thing in our search module is finding the "good" heuristics. Because I found it quite tricky 
and heuristics play an important role. Our implementations for different modules, astar or gbf search, all depends on 
how well we implemented the heuristics function. A  good heuristics function helps the AI find the optimal solution quickly 
while a bad heuristics makes our module runs slowly and may be get stuck. Of course, wirting the heursitics function 
cost me most of the time. For each problem which did not produce a solution within the time interval, I needed to 
debug it and print out states and acitons and analyze at which step, according to the heursitics, lead to our robot went 
wrong.
