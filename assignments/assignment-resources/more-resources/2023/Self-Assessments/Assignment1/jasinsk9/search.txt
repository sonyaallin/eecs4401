#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I think what I learned the most was how difficult it is to design a proper heuristic for
such a simple sounding game as Sokoban. It seems to be a super simple idea but it took
me a long time to design a heuristic that worked even remotely well because there are so
many simple things that as a human player I never would have considered could happen. When
would the box ever get stuck in a corner? Well, when it's AI with no brain. Even after completing
my heuristic it is still not perfect by any means and not very good in my opinion. I can only
imagine how difficult it must be for other things and am even more impressed about projects I
have seen in the past such as Chess and Go bots and especially OpenAI's DOTA 2 project.
