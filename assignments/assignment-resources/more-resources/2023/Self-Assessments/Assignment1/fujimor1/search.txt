#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

One of the significant things I learned from the Search module is the importance of hashing. 
It utilizes the hashing technique effectively so that each state has an immutable and unique representation. 
This allows us to implement cycle checking (i.e., check whether the same states have been already visited or not) easily. 
On the other hand, if we don't use the hashing technique and the state doesn't have a unique representation, 
there is no way to compare the equivalence of the two states.
