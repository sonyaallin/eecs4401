#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I found while working on this assignment is how we can
use a general class like StateSpace in order to develop a complicated search problem 
like Sokoban or even the water jugs problem. Sokoban has to consider so many possible 
states with the robots and there are different possible paths, but still, the basic 
search algorithms like A*, greedy best-first search can be used to find a possible 
path for this problem. I also found the process of finding an alternate heuristic 
very fascinating since it is so open-ended and we have so much flexibility on how we 
want to improve our search heuristic.
