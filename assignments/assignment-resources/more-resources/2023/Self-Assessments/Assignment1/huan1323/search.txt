#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

    From the implementation of this assignment, I learned that trade-off on the
runtime and accuracy takes a big part of the search algorithm.
    For the perspective on implementing the heuristic, we need to be careful on
the runtime in the estimation. An accurate estimation may cost a higher runtime.
Since the heuristic function is repeatedly running in the whole search algorithm,
we need to test if this approach is really saving time in the whole search
algorithm for us.
    For the perspective of the whole search algorithm, we need to figure out
whether finding solutions for most cases is more important or finding the
optimal solutions is more significant. When we want to approach the optimal path,
like set a lower weight in weight A* and use iterative versions, our codes need
more time to terminate.  The iterative search algorithms take a high priority on
the timebound. In most cases, the code can find a solution, but it may take
higher costs. The normal A* guarantees to find the optimal solution, but it
cannot terminate in 2 seconds in most of the examples.
    In conclusion, when we are doing an Artificial Intelligence project, we need
to decide the methods based on if we are focus on the quality of the solutions
or the quantity of the solutions. After that, we implement the heuristic with a
balance on the runtime and the accuracy.
