#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

I learned how unique to a specific problem a heuristic can be. The manhattan heuristic was fairly general, but attempting to improve on it,
I found many different approaches that did not work given our time constraints. For example, in trying to allot boxes to a unique storage, but also the absolute closest
storage such that the total cost would be the lowest possible with every box in a unique storage, the algorithm i wrote ended up being far too costly to be worth doing in most cases.
I settled on simply assigning each box to the closest storage in the order that they're in inside the frozenset. There may be a faster way to do this, in fact, I found papers
which may hold the key, although I did not read them to avoid any plaigarism.
I also wrote an algorigthm that could predict if a box would get stuck on the way to its storage before it even encountered obstacles, but that proved too costly as well.
The most interesting find was when I realized two things:
    1. If a box is on the edge of the board, it can only be moved to a storage that is on the edge as well
    2. A storage space can get cornered and blocked if it is surrounderd by other storage spaces and boxes are placed there (this can happen in problem 10, 16, 17, 18, 19)
Implenting code to handle these situations lead to 15/20 solves with iterative weighted a star, but less solves with gbfs.
Since, we are marking based on both gbfs and weighted a star, I left this code out, but I would love to revisit this.
I cannot wait to see if there is a better heuristic for this.
