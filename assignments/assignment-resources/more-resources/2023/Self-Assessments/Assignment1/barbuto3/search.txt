#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I've learned from this module is that it is difficult 
to mimic human intelligence, and as a result, in artificial intelligence there will 
always be a tradeoff between performance and accuracy when searching for a solution. 
More specifically, this tradeoff can exist in the complexity/type of the heuristics 
you want to use, as well as the search algorithm itself. I also learned that sometimes
"doing nothing" can even be a good heuristic in some cases.

For example, when checking if some state is certain to never yield a solution, I initially 
thought that it would be beneficial to check: if a box is on a wall and there is a storage
point on that wall, then I must also check if there is an obstacle in between which would
prevent that box from ever reaching that store (since boxes on walls can never be pushed 
inward, they must always remain on that wall). However, a simplified version was the better
choice as the extra check for obstacles along the wall was not rewarding enough compared
to the time it took to calculate it. Thus, I decided to keep the simplified version, which
was only to flag the state as 'unsolvable' if there were no stores on the same wall, and don't
even check if there are obstacles in the way. Thus, the heuristic is still admissible, but
comes with the cost of some accuracy with the gain of performance.
