There are many different types of search algorithms that can be used to solve a problem. The heuristic search is an
interesting option that allows a search to have extra information. However, from the assignment it became clear that
finding a good, admissible heuristic can be quite difficult as search problems increase in complexity. Encoding the
distance to the goal from a certain state is difficult to conceptualize and requires some heavy thinking. Aside from
the heuristic search, the uninformed search algorithms were each well suited for separate problem types, for example
depth first search is best to reduce memory usage. Its interesting to see how to decide what might be the best search
algorithm to use for a particular problem.
