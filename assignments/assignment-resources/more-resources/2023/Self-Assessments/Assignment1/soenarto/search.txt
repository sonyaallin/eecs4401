#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I have learned from this search module is that designing optimal
heuristic functions are difficult. I had to draw out multiple Sokoban boards and think of
multiple conditions in order to get more problems to pass. I was forced to think creatively
and outside my comfortzone, which is a similar feeling I encounter in most math clases with
proofs. It is really cool how even a slight change in heuristic functions can impact how
the search runs completely differently. I had a lot of fun testing and designing multiple
heuristic functions and it was definitely a rewarding experience seeing more and more problems
being solved as I improved upon my heuristic function.
