#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

Mostly how to use the search module. Being a module, it's very modular. All it really requires is the a heuristics function
and an f-function. The search itself just needs to be initiated, and then run with the proper time and cost bounds. The state node
object is accessible to see your search, and the search stats allow you to see the amount of paths pruned and the time it took to 
run. For this assignment, the search module made it very easy to get the iterative A, weighted A, and iterative greedy search to work.
Out of all the questions, the longest was by far making the heuristics function.
