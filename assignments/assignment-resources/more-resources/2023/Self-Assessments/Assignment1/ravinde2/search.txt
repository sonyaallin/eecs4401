#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?
I learned alot about heuristics during this module. I think the most significant thing I learned
was that a more detailed heurstic does not always lead to a better solution. It seems obvious in retrospect
but I had assumed that if we caluclate more and more we would keep getting better and better models, and with
infinite computation time this is probably true. But somethings are just to insignificant and the time spent
to factor it in isn't worth it. When I started my heuristic for a1 I tried to have like 5 different things being
checked but this slowed down computation to the point that nothing was been calucalted. Instead finding one 
specific parameter and focusing on it yeilded the best results.
