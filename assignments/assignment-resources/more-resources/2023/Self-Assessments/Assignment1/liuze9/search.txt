#What is the most significant thing you have learned from the search module?

The most significant thing I learned from the search module is how to make good search algorithms.
I learned about differnt types of searches like hueristic searches, uniform cost search, and A*.
I learned about what conditions make a good search like admissibility and consistency and how making an algorithm iterative can save time and space.
I learned how to prove when certain algorithms will give an optimal solution, how much storage it will take, and what the runtime will be.
Another thing that I learned which helps me make search algorithms is how to pick good heuristics by picking a heuristic that solves a simpler problem.
