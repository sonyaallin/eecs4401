Hello hezi11,

Assignment 1 for CSC384 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence has been marked.

The assignment was evaluated automatically through a series of tests.  These tests included 40 problems much like those you were given with the assignment and were run in a controlled environment. Variation in marks between runs was small and less than 2 marks. Of note, all raw marks were inflated by 5% and, in some cases, marks from the automarker may have been raised based on a manual review. Any manual adjustments will appear on MarkUs. People generally solved fewer problems with their iterative_astar than with iterative_gbfs but at least one student solved all 40 within the time limit using iterative_astar. By contrast, the maximum number of problem solved with iterative_gbfs and test_heuristic was 38 of 40.

The marking criteria used to grade your assignment were as follows:

1. Test of f-value computation: check only 10 different weights for a specific state: totally 5%

Your score on this test: 5/5

2. Test of the heuristic function (marks based only on number of solves):

solving ">1" and "<5" problems: 5%
solving ">=5" and "<= manhattan benchmark": 5 + (0-4)%
solving ">= manhattan benchmark" and "<= better benchmark": 5 + 5 + (0-10)%
solving "> better benchmark" and "< better benchmark + 3": 5 + 5 + 10 + 3 = 23%
solving " >= better benchmark + 3": 5 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 25%

Your score on this test: 15/25

3. Test of iterative best first search (marks based only on number of solves):

solving ">1" and "<5" problems: 5%
solving ">=5" and "<= manhattan benchmark": 5 + (0-4)%
solving ">= manhattan benchmark" and "<= better benchmark": 5 + 5 + (0-10)%
solving "> better benchmark" and "< better benchmark + 3": 5 + 5 + 10 + 3 = 23%
solving " >= better benchmark + 3": 5 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 25%

Your score on this test: 0/25

4. Test of the iterative weighted A-star function:

solving ">1" and "<5" problems: 5%
solving ">=5" and "<= manhattan benchmark": 5 + (0-4)%
solving ">= manhattan benchmark" and "<= better benchmark": 5 + 5 + (0-10)%
solving ">= better benchmark" and in all solved ones outperform or equal to better benchmark in length:
5 + 5 + 10 + (0-5)% of rest based on (# of length <= benchmark  - # of solved by better benchmark)
solving ">= better benchmark" and not all solved ones outperform or equal to better benchmark in length:
5 + 5 + 10 + (0-5)% of rest based on (# of solved - # of solved by better benchmark)

Your score on this test: 0/25

5. Test of Manhattan distance based heuristic on 40 problems: total 10%

Your score on this test: 10/10

6. Test of the weighted A-star function: total 10%

State counts increase with lower weights: 5%
Solutions refined with lower weights: 5%

Your score on this test: 0/10

Your total mark: 30/100

Any manual adjustments to your mark will appear on MarkUs!

Details produced by the automarker on your scores are below, along with any runtime errors.
