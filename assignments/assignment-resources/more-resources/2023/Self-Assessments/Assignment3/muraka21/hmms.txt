I learned how the emissions are important to help us understand and make
assumptions of what happened in a previous state in the process that we are
analyzing. Another important thing that I learned in this topic is the
"Blocking" in Baye's Nets. Blocking is important to be accounted for because
if you are not given information about a certain node that connects to other
nodes it could mean that we would have a block or not, in other words, having
information about a node or not, could lead to two other nodes being
independent or not. I found that really fascinating because I had never noticed
this behavior where for example if we do not know that whether your body aches,
the fact that you have Flu or Malaria are independent, now if we know that your
body aches, now those two conditions become dependent. I will probably not look
at Siri the same way, now I understand the amount of data that she needs to
keep track of in order to better perform speech recognition. I also noticed
that HMM could also be used in touch screen keyboards, because since the keys
are so small they usually need to predict what are the most likely next key to
be pressed so that they increase that key's touch area, creating a better user
experience, instead of users always pressing the wrong keys.
