The most important things I learned about this module is how to work with probabilities in general, 
and how important are they in our day to day life. It was very interesting to learn about all the "hidden" 
probability layers and the emisions, and how they interact with each other in order to produce a final probability. 
HMMs are very important, and can be found everywere where some kind of decision making is performed. I think this 
module will help me greatly in the future, not only in computer science, 
but also any time a probability is involved in a certain situation.
