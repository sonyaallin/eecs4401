What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network
module?

As with Most of the other topics weve covered so far, i've noticed that its
very important to optimize the way you represent you data by finding whats the
best kind of model to use before the AI. I also found very much to be true the
concept of 'garbage in garbage out'. This is probably a result of the fact that
with these hypertuned models that depend heavily on the math being correct,
every last calculation has to be right other wise the math will fail and by
result, the whole system will collapse.
