I learned that bayesian networks are very useful. They are prevalent everywhere and provide a fairly reliable way to make inferences based on past observations. I also learned that probability is a key concept and is very useful when used with machine learning. Coll properties such as bayesian inference and conditional probabilities help predict and aid in real like scenarios. Bayesian networks can be used as predication models or classifiers. Many systems today use bayesian inference as a core mechanic and are integral to society. Some of these techonlogies are chatbots, Siri, voice assistant, weather forecasting, and even medical devices. The applications are diverse and we have barely scratched the surface. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for Bayesian networks.
