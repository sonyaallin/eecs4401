Bayesian networks is a very powerful way to create models based on data inputed, they can help with calculating probability of stuff within the 
bayesian network. HMM can be seen almost everywhere, we can use it to determine if it is going to rain or it can be used to correctly tag words like 
this assignment. I learned that HMM can be applied to almost everything. Siri is one example that I would have never thought used HMM, however I now
know that Siri probably used HMM to train and it is amazing how just based on some test data it can be trained to predict many other things. I also think
HMM can be used for target ads and based on data collected they could probably create some HMM that will predict what ads would be good to show the user.
