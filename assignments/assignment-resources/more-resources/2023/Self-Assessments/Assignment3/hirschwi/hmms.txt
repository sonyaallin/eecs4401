I find Bayesian Networks extremely difficult, and not at all intuitive. I feel relatively confident in my ability to train the model, but in terms of how to use that training, I feel totally lost, and am unsure as to where to even begin. I'm half tempted to simply take a hopeful 42% for correct training, and take the L on the rest. I'm so lost, that I legitimately think it is more worth it to save my grace tokens for A4, and hope I can do better there with that time, rather than attempt to make something here.
