	Learning Bayesian Networks has really opened me up to statistics. Before this unit, I've never really appreciated statistics but the markov models we learned and worked with is much more applicable. Through even this assignment, I see a lot of application with them and not just statistical theory being taught. Many daily activities can be modelled using markov models or hmms such as mood, natural disasters, language, health, etc. I definitely see such activities in a different after learning about bayesian nets.
