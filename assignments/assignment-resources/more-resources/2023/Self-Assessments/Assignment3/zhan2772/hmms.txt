The probability is hard, however, after learning this module, I realized that probability can be used to solve a lot of problems in real life rather just dry theories. Using smart algorithms like the bayesian net, we can use simple concepts, i.e. conditional probability, to model really complex things. And it's very interesting to see the hidden Markov model. Because I never thought what to do if the observation do not give us a true result. By introducing hidden states that influenced by the observation we can resolve this issue. Then using cleaver algorithms like Viterbi we can efficiently find out the most likely result. After all, it is very exciting to learn such interesting concept.
