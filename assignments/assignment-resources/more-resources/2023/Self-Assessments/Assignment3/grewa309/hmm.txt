The most significant things about baysian networks I learned is how it can be used 
to make predictions in data. Whether that be some sort of line detector, siri's language 
processing, or something else, bayesian networks are used all the time. Even the assignment that 
we did specifically has so many useful applications. Learning about how we have to adapt our 
baysian networks(hidden markov models) to involve any sort of emissions was also quite interesting. 
This is very important in cases where we can't directly predict the state of a node in the markov mmodel,
where we need to consider the emissions.
