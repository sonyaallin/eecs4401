Bayesian networks work on the principle of chaining probability of different outcomes based on the previous experiences we have had with an event,  individual states of each event, and the likelihood of an event causing another. By chaining these probabilities, we can find the most probable outcome of these events, or we can marginalize out the probabilities of prior events to find the probability of any individual event happening at a given time. This project made me realize how simple probabilties can be so powerful in computation. I can also develop a rough idea of how different problems like speech recognition, spam filters, dna sequencing can all utilize bayes nets for more accurate results. Bayes nets also reminded me a bit of neural networks with the chaining of event probabilities (similar to neurons), but I'm not sure if the similarities end there or not.
