I learned a lot about probabilities and the best ways of going about finding them. I also learned that generally, more data is better as there is less variance of results. I found that HMMs were not as difficult to code as I would have thought, but there are still lots of places for error and its easy to get lost sometimes. In terms of existing language Hmms like siri or google asssistant, I do understand better now how they work, and same for predictive suggestions for example when you are writing an email and you are auto suggested a continuation of your current sentence.
