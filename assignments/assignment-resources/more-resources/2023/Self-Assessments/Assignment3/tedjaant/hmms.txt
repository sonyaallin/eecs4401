#What is the most significant thing you have elarned from the baysian network module?

The most significant thing that I have learned from the baysian network module is that
hmms are conceptually more simpler than previously thought. These AI algorithms that assign
or predict states are just maximization problems on all possible states and decides on
the most probable state based on its observations. When we train the hmm, we just adjust
probabilities proportional to factors such as placement and frequency so that we can use
the probability tables to decide on unseen tests. We take advantage of probability rules
and assumptions to cut down on the operations to save computational costs. This is why
hmms are more common than we think, seeing its uses in many programs today.
