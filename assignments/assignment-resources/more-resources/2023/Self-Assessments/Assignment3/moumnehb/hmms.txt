This assignment and unit has broadened my view on how we can use models to simulate
possible outcomes given previous experienced outcomes. the hidden Markov model
allows us to model many different everyday scenarios that in turn allow us to
"predict the future". It as has been very interesting to see how we can apply Bayes
nets in to a real world application that is used many billions every day. The
Bayesian network model has many application and POS tagging is merely one of them.
By using independence and joint probabilities we can estimate accurately the different
possible outcomes. This assignment has also taught me the the importance of good
book keeping and how it can simplify many processes.
