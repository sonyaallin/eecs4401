Question 1:
The first calculation shows that gender plays a impactful role when calculate of the probability that a female getting over 50K salary,
while the second calculation shows how unimportant gender is when the target is a male. With the same work, occupation, education, and relationship status,
female are often getting less salary.

The third and forth calculation shows that with the prediction of getting over 50K salary, males tend to actually have a salary over 50K than female
with a probability of 54% while female only has 37%

The fifth and sixth calculation indicates when not considering gender, female still have weaker background than male to have over 50K salary

In my opinion, the predictions are only 'fair' when the target of prediction is male as shown by calculation 2. In other cases,
gender impacts greatly the prediction.

I would not recommend to use this model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm, because how impactful gender is during the prediction,
while gender itself should not be a great factor when hire employee or predicting starting salaries.

Question 2
Bayesian Networks are a powerful tool for probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.
The most significant thing one can learn from the Bayesian Network module is the ability to model complex systems and
make predictions based on available data. Bayesian Networks allow users to represent uncertain knowledge and dependencies
between variables, which can be used to identify the most likely causes of an event or make predictions about the future.

Moreover, the Bayesian Network module can be applied in various fields, such as finance, medicine, engineering, and
social sciences. It can be used to identify risk factors in medical diagnoses, predict stock market trends, or
identify the causes of equipment failure in engineering.

Overall, the most significant thing that one can learn from the Bayesian Network module is its potential to
handle uncertain and complex situations and provide a framework for making decisions based on available data.
By mastering this tool, one can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions in various fields.

Question 3
The self-assessment exercises can help me to think deeper in some degree, and it is worth the time to do it.
