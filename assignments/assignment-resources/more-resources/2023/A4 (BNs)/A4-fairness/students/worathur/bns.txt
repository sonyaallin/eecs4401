# What do the calculations tell us about fairness?

From answering questions 1 and 2, we know that for 99% of women in the test set our model
predicted a salary >= 50K with lower probability once it knew the participant was female. Meanwhile, for all men
in the training set our model predicted a salary of >= 50K with greater or equal probability once it knew
the participant was male. So we can conclude that the model's predictions are not separated from
gender given the evidence.

From answering questions 3 and 4, we know the probability of actually having a salary >= 50K
given a predicted salary >= 50K is smaller for women than it is for men. This implies that our model's
salary prediction for women is less accurate than the salary predictions for men.

From question 5 and 6, we observe that the model predicted a salary of >=50K for only 8% of women
meanwhile it predicted a salary of >=50K for 25% of men. Thus, the model does not achieve demographic parity.

Based on the above observations I would not use this model to recommend starting
salaries at a firm. If a new employee has qualifications (e.g. education)
which justify a higher starting salary, then gender should not be a factor in approving the higher salary.
Our model may not adhere to this reasoning since we observed that evidence which included education level
was not able to separate predicted salary from gender.

# Reflection

The most significant thing I learned from the Bayesian Networks module is that
Bayesian Networks are an effective graphical tool for encoding our assumptions about the independence of
variables and can be used to make inferences under uncertainty. I learned that when making such inferences
conditional independence assumptions present in the network's structure can simplify specification of the joint
distribution. I learned about the data structures (factors) a computer uses to perform variable elimination,
and how to manipulate these factors to obtain a conditional probability distribution. I also learned that using the
min-fill heuristic on polytrees allows the variable elimination algorithm to run in time linear in the number of
variables.

I understood that naive bayes nets are simple and can be a good start for making inferences using real world data. Lastly,
I leanred of the various methods for assessing fairness of models.
