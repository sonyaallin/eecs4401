The most significant thing I learned from this module is how to represent and reason events with uncertain knowledge. This assignment helped me to understand better what factors are and how to do operations on them such as multiplying, and knowing how their scopes change and how values can be computed. Pretty much all methods that were in this assignment enhanced my understanding on the topic of Bayesian networks (restricting a factor, normalizing probabilities, summing out a variable…..). I did not get to completely finish the Variable Elimination which I regret now starting earlier. 
I think self-evaluating exercises like this are useful and don’t take that much time to do anyways, which I think is valuable to be kept in future terms of this class.
