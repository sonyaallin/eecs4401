The most significant thing that I have learned from the Bayesian Network module is how to set up and create a Bayesian
Network from some dataset, how to implement variable elimination and how the algorithm works, and the various
helper function (such as multiply factors, restrict factors, etc.) that are need in order to perform a proper
variable elimination algorithm. In addition, I also learned how the ways and different types of ordering of the
variables can influence the overall time complexity of the algorithm, therefore it is important to take that into
consideration when performing a variable elimination.

The self-assessments in the exercises have been of value because it allowed me to reflect and review the work that I
have done for the assignments. This seems like a nice thing to continue into the next term.
