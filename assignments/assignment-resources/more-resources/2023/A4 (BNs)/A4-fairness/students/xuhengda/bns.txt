I got the result of questions are:

91.3087726440057
40.62684801892371
9.11866476694484

The probability is not high. The fairness of Bayes model should be able to
accurately predict the probability for different datasets. In other word,
the model should not favor on some characterstic such like work, education,
occupation and gender etc. The bayes model I wrote cannot predict with high
accuracy. Hence, I would not use my model to recommend starting salaries for 
employees at a firm. This is because any model is only as good as the data it
is trained on. My model is trained with the prior variable "Salary". It has 
biased. So, I will not use my model to recommend starting salaries for 
employees at a firm.

First, I write the five operations will be used in the variable elimination.
It is difficult to start. After I kept trying to print values and understand 
all the classes, the operations started to get easier. The Factor.recursive_print_value()
method is really helpful. So, I can assign value to any variables recursively like
a tree. Actually, it is a static question. If I set value to the a variable, how
many permutation of remaining variables there are is the core idea.

For the min_fill_herusitic, the core idea is to calculate how many edges connect
to the queryvar. 

It is good to think hard on these operations. This is because I found that it easy
to implement variable elimination. Based on the lecture slide, I actually every steps
what should I do.

The model function is hard to start, too. It is really empty. 

The basic idea of model function is what factor I need to compute P(a|b).
So, we need P(a intersection b) and P(b).

Since the handout said b is Salary, I create the factor for Salary to calculate
P("<50K") and P(">=50K"). Then, I create P(a|Salay) factors. After understanding
the static formula, it easy to implement the model function.

For the last part, I think the most difficult part is to use the correct dataset.
I am not sure on this part. So, I have no idea about the correctness of this explore
function. 

Overall, the biggest help of this assignment is to understand every step of variable
elimination and the structure of Bayes model.

I think the exercise question is very good. It actually helps me understand the concept
deeply.

The suggestions are:
1. More detailed docstring and handout.
2. More pre-exercise of assignment on lab section.

This is because it is hard to start. Just for me. For A3 and A4, the handout is
not clear for some parts(There are few sentences.) I can understand. 
Handouts and docstrings that are too long can scare students. HAHAHA:)

Everything is good. The course is very nice and interesting! Thanks!
