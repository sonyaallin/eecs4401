What I learned from this assignment is that Variable Elimination can be broken up into multiple parts (or functions) in order to properly compute conditional distributions given a query variable and a set of evidence variables, as well as a set of factors that have been tailored to different variables. I learned that for every factor with a variable in the given evidence variables list, we need to replace that factor with its restriction based on the condition that the variable is given a value as its assignment. Next, I had to create a new factor that is the product of all the factors that contain the hidden variable (variable that is not an evidence variable) for each hidden variable mentioned given in scopes of all the factors. Those factors are removed and replaced with the new factor. After all of the hidden variables are taken care of, then the final factors left in the original list of factors are those that contain the query variable. A new factor is created by multiplying these factors, and it is normalized so that the probability distribution for each value in the domain of the query variable sum to one.

The hardest part of this assignment, or this material in general, was trying to understand how exactly Variable Elimination works because probability and statistics is not my preferred subject to go over. Another challenge to this assignment was understanding how min_fill_ordering works in the context of this assignment. Overall, this was probably the hardest assignment out of all the assignments.
