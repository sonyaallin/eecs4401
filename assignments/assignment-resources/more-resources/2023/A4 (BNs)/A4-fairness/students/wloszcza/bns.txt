I didn't do the calculations because I’ve been sick, but I suspect the network wouldn't be fair and one gender (probably male) would have a tendency to earn over $50K which would make the network unfair. I would not use the model to recommend starting salaries for a few reasons. One gender may get higher starting salaries over the other, the salary data could be old and would not give accurate market rate salaries, and it would not take into account their individual qualifications. I would not feel good assigning starting salaries in such a strict way and would not expect all employees to fit perfectly into the model.

The most significant thing I learned about was the different factor methods like multiply, restrict, and sum_out. I have been sick for the past two weeks so I wasn’t really able to work on the other parts of the assignment that much. I guess I learned how to modify the factors and a little bit about how variable elimination works such as the steps to take and how the query variable and evidence variables are used in the algorithm. I attempted the min_fill_ordering functions but there wasn’t much information on it so I assumed it involved counting how many factors contain each variable and ordering the variables in increasing order.

I don’t personally think these exercises have had much value. I find the word minimums make me have to stretch out my answers when I don’t feel I have much to talk about. They could be continued next term, but I don’t really feel like it would make much of a difference either way.
