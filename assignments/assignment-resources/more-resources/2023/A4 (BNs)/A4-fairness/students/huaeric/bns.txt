1. Though I'm not fully sure about the meanings behind the percentages I think that the whole goal of this part of the assignment is to see whether there is a bias for producing results and even if they don't have gender provided as evidence. I would say that percentages found from questions 1 and 2 reveal more information of whether gender influences the Naive model network since if it's a noticably low percentage then it translates to the model being influenced by gender more than it should. I would not use my model to recommend starting salaries to employees at a firm since mainly since I do not understand whether or not it works as it's intended but also because my percentages I receive are extremely low or extremely high with nothing inbetween.

2. The most significant thing I learned about by Bayesian Network Module overall is how the proccess of the variable elimination algorithm works when making predictions on a given dataset. I learned how given a Query Variable I can return a distribution over the domain from the variable by restricting factors, finding a good heuristic to order the factors, then by multiplying factors factors that are neighbors of the factor to be eliminated, and etc... Next I would also say it was interesting to produce a joint distribution of value assignments given file data when implementing the Naive Bayes model as it made me realize how data affects the predictions made for a column.

3. I would say that these exercises are a good way of recapping what you implemented for the assignment and useful in a way to make you understand the bigger picture of what the assignment is trying to teach. So I would recommend these exercises to continue for next term.
