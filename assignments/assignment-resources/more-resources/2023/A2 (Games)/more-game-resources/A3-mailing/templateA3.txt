Hello {},

Assignment 3 for CSC384 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence has been marked.

Your assignment was evaluated automatically through a series of tests. The tests, and the marking criteria that was used, are as follows:

(1) Test of Minimax implementation (includes tests of utility function) (%30 total)
[function=test_minimax_max_node_1]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_minimax_max_node_2]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_minimax_min_node_1]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_select_move_minimax]: 10 points max (10%)
[function=test_compute_utility]: 5 points max (5%)

(2) Test of Alpha-beta implementation (includes tests of utility function) (%30 max)
[function=test_alphabeta_max_node_1]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_alphabeta_max_node_2]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_alphabeta_min_node_1]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_select_move_alphabeta]: 10 points max (10%)
[function=test_select_move_equal]: 5 points max (5%)

(3) Test of State Caching (%10 max)
[function=test_caching_big]: 4 points max (4%)
[function=test_caching_xl]: 6 points max (6%)

(3) Test of Node Ordering (%10 max)
[function=test_ordering_1]: 5 points max (5%)
[function=test_ordering_2]: 5 points max (5%)

(5) Test of Depth Limit (%10 max)
[function=test_depth]: 10 points max (10%)

(6) Test of Heuristic Function (%10 max)

The heuristic test pitted your heuristic against an agent playing with compute_utility over 10 games on a 6x6 board with varying depth limits. 

Points were awarded as follows:

0 points if compute_heuristic and compute_utility were identical
4 points if # losses > # wins
6 points if # losses = # wins
10 points if # losses < # wins

For your submission, results on basic tests were the following:
[function=test_minimax_max_node_1]:  {}
[function=test_minimax_max_node_2]:  {}
[function=test_minimax_min_node_1]:  {}
[function=test_select_move_minimax]:  {}
[function=test_compute_utility]:  {}
[function=test_alphabeta_max_node_1]:  {}
[function=test_alphabeta_max_node_2]:  {}
[function=test_alphabeta_min_node_1]:  {}
[function=test_select_move_alphabeta]:  {}
[function=test_select_move_equal]:  {}
[function=test_caching_big]:  {}
[function=test_caching_xl]:  {}
[function=test_ordering_1]:  {}
[function=test_ordering_2]:  {}
[function=test_depth]:  {}
=====================================
