This homework really opened my eyes and deepened my understanding of algorithms again. 
As long as a game meets specific requirements, the computer can violently calculate the
 best algorithm. As computer students, what we really need to think about is not the 
 possibility or impossibility that ordinary people think, but the speed at which I can 
 crack a game violently. . For example, using puring can greatly speed up the cracking 
 speed, which is really amazing. I have to say that there are many similar things that 
 I believe can be cracked, not just games. In fact, many games are closely related to 
 game theory, and game theory is used and practiced everywhere in life. I really look 
 forward to how many problems that we seem to be impossible to calculate with computers 
 can also be solved with the development. Brute force. Algorithms are everything! ! !
