Q: What is the most significant thing you have learned from this exercise?

A: What I have learned with this most recent excercise is the variablity even in solved games, and of the human element present in game play.
While something like checkers or mancala may technically be solved, the issue is not with wether a game is deterministic. Most limitations
on game playing algorithms is not mathmatical, but physical in nature. Most rule based competition relie either on 1: on randomness, or 2: game
states so vast it is inhuman to anticipate. 
Yet as our game playing substitutes become more complex, the human element inherent to the challenge of a game falters, while some of the type 1
games yet live, mostly due to the magnitude or vastness offered. One cannot help but think it may be of matter of time before the only beatable
computers are those playing for chance.
It seems slightly jarring to me, the significants some put in conquering fictional scenarios with computational prowess, but in some parts, it
may link to our desire for the pinnical, to see the highest possible skill cieling. And while the strongest steel or fastest car will be up to
rigorous physical manpulation. To perfect a player needs only time, and how fast it can and will be done.
IT is also intersesting to note this is the few areas of programmming with a strictly adversarial design, meant to counter or predict a variable
that actively resist prediction, our own projects mainly account for the most optimal opponent, one much like our selves, but there can be so
much variation in adversity, they could be less optimal, accounting for long terms, or counter analytic, changing in what it encounters,
or even just a black box, it's responses an enigma.
