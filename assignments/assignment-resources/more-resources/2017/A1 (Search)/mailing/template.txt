95% of the assignment was evaluated automatically through a series of tests.  These tests, and the marking criteria that was used, are as follows:

(1) Test of the heuristic function in the context of best first search
(based on # solved in 5 seconds; 25% max).
BASE SCORE:
- 10 points for a basic working implementation that solved at least 5 problems
- 15 points for an implementation that outperformed a basic benchmark (which solved 19 problems)
- 20 points for an implementation that outperformed a "better" benchmark (which solved 30 problems) 
BONUS:
- 5 additional points  if you beat the benchmark by a margin of more than 2 problems
(2) Test of anytime greedy best first search: fixed time bound 
(based on # solved and length; 25% max)
BASE SCORE:
- 5 points for a basic working implementation that solved at least 5 problems
- 10 points for an implementation that outperformed a basic benchmark (which solved 15 problems) 
- 15 points for an implementation that outperformed a "better" benchmark (which solved 30 problems) 
BONUS:
- 5 additional points  if the lengths of any solution were shorter than the benchmark
- 7.5 additional points  if the lengths of more than 1/2 of your solutions were shorter than the benchmark
DEDUCTIONS:
- 5 points if the length of any solution was LONGER than the corresponding one from regular best first search
- 5 points if anytime greedy best first produced FEWER solutions than regular best first search
(3) Test of the weighted a star function: fixed time bound 
(based on # solved and length; %25 max)
BASE SCORE:
- 5 points for a basic working implementation that solved at least 5 problems
- 10 points for an implementation that outperformed a basic benchmark (which solved 15 problems) 
- 15 points for an implementation that outperformed a "better" benchmark (which solved 28 problems) 
BONUS:
- 5 additional points  if the lengths of any solution were shorter than the benchmark
- 7.5 additional points  if the lengths of more than 1/2 of your solutions were shorter than the benchmark
(4) An additional of 5 points was awarded to students solving 38 or more problems with BOTH anytime search implementations.
(5) Test of f-value computation (based on 10 test cases similar to test code provided to students; 10% max)
(6) Test of manhattan distance heuristic (based on test cases similar to test code provided to students; 10% max)
(7) Read of tips.txt (5 sensible tips for heuristics for snowman domain; 5% max)
