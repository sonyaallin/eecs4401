Hello,

Assignment 2 for CSC384 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence has been
marked.

The assignment was evaluated automatically through a series of tests.  These tests, 
and the marking criteria that was used, are as follows:

(1) Tests of the first Hitori model: binary constraints (25% max; 6 tests total)
- Checking that variables are initialized with correct domains; 
- Testing row and col constraints; 
- Checking for binary constraints;
- Checking that BT fails to assign values to variables given students' constraints 
when problem is unsolvable;   
- Testing for correct number of constraints;  
- Checking to ensure satisfying tuples for each constraint are initialized correctly.        
(2) Tests of the second Hitori model: n-ary constraints (25% max; 5 tests total)
Tests included: 
- Checking that variables are initialized with correct domains; 
- Checking row and col constraints; 
- Checking to ensure constraints are ONLY n-ary constraints;
- Checking to ensure unsolvable problems are not solved;
- Checking that solutions based on model and found with various orderings are valid 
Hitori solutions (3 tests, 20 second time limit).
(3) Tests of MRV ordering (10% max; 6 tests total)
Tests included: 
- Test identical to that provided in test script (1 point)
- Test of MRV with 3 different sized domains and x + y = z (1 point)
- Test of MRV with 3 different size domains, where the largest domain would result in a 
DWO (1 point)
- Test of MRV after assigning variables (1 point)
- Test of MRV with Forward Checking for nQueens (1 point)
- 5 Tests of  MRV with Forward Checking for Hitori (results aggregated into 1 point)
(4) Tests of DH ordering (10% max; 3 tests total)
- Three tests of degree heuristic on simple CSP problems (not Hitori)
(5) Tests of LCV ordering (20% max; 6 tests total)
- Four tests of LCV heuristic on simple CSP problems (not Hitori)
(6) Tests of Custom ordering (based on 5 runs of nQueens problem; 10% max)
- 2 points awarded if custom ordering works but does not outperform MRV (on average)
- 5 points awarded if custom ordering is equivalent to MRV (on average)
- 7 points awarded if custom ordering outperforms MRV in terms of either # of variable 
assignments or # of prunes (on average)
- 10 points awarded if custom ordering outperforms MRV in terms of both # of variable 
assignments and # of prunes (on average)
