1. Check for states that in which finding a solution would be impossible. For example corners and walls.

2. Weigh the distances of each snowball from the goal differently so that the search tries to move the larger snowball first.

3. The distance between the robot and the goal is also important to keep track of, but not as important as the snowballs. It a good idea to put a weight < 1 on this distance

4. Check to see if the current state puts the medium or small snowball in the goal first. This state generally should be avoided although it is not a dead state.

5. Make sure that you are not in a previously visited states as they are redudant and guarantee that you will not find the most efficient solution.
