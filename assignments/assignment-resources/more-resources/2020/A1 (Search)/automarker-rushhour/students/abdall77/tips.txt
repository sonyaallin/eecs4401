1. A* doesnt significantly improve with time because the definition of optimal efficiency is the set of nodes 
expanded, as opposed to the number of expansions (which is what A*'s # of iterations). This could possibly result 
in a node expanded by A* multiple times, even an exponential # of times, so in those cases, other algos can 
outpeform it.

2. Min moves falls short when the goal vehicle blocked by other cars that must be moved so that the goal
 vehicle can reach the goal, so the number of min moves is higher than what

3. I dont think I'll have enough time to code it, but I think a key improvment would be to calculate the distance 
from the goal PLUS the number of vehicles in the way (that would ideally be moved) on the path to the goal.
