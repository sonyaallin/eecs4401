Overall: 0/75
====================
Test Case: [function=test_anytime_gbfs]	[[46, 4, 0]/25]
	Given more time, anytime gbfs improved the length of solutions for 46/50 problems.
Given more time, anytime gbfs worsened the length of solutions for 0/50 problems.
Given the same time, regular BFS performed better than anytime gbfs on 4/50 problems.
====================
Test Case: [function=test_anytime_weighted_astar]	[[33, 49, 1, 0]/25]
	With heur_min_moves, anytime astar solved 33 of 50 problems.
More time resulted in the same performance on 49/50 problems.
More time improved performance of anytime astar on 1/50 problems.
More time worsened performance of anytime astar on 0/50 problems.
====================
Test Case: [function=test_heuristic]	[[8, 21, 13, 8]/25]
	8/50 problems were solved using Best First Search with the student heuristic and not solved with the min_moves heuristic.
21/50 problems were solved using Best First Search with the student heuristic and the min_moves heuristic.
13/50 problems were not solved using Best First Search with any heuristic.
8/50 problems were not solved using Best First Search with the student heuristic, yet were solved using the min_moves heuristic.
