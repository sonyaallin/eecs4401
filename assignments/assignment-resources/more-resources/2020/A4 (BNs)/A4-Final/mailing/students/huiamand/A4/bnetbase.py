'''Classes for variable elimination Routines
   A) class BN_Variable

      This class allows one to define Bayes Net variables.

      On initialization the variable object can be given a name and a
      domain of values. This list of domain values can be added to or
      deleted from in support of an incremental specification of the
      variable domain.

      The variable also has a set and get value method. These set a
      value for the variable that can be used by the factor class. 


    B) class factor

      This class allows one to define a factor specified by a table
      of values. 

      On initialization the variables the factor is over is
      specified. This must be a list of variables. This list of
      variables cannot be changed once the constraint object is
      created.

      Once created the factor can be incrementally initialized with a
      list of values. To interact with the factor object one first
      sets the value of each variable in its scope (using the
      variable's set_value method), then one can set or get the value
      of the factor (a number) on those fixed values of the variables
      in its scope.

      Initially, one creates a factor object for every conditional
      probability table in the bayes-net. Then one initializes the
      factor by iteratively setting the values of all of the factor's
      variables and then adding the factor's numeric value using the
      add_value method. 

    C) class BN
       This class allows one to put factors and variables together to form a Bayes net.
       It serves as a convient place to store all of the factors and variables associated
       with a Bayes Net in one place. It also has some utility routines to, e.g,., find
       all of the factors a variable is involved in.

class Factor: 

    '''Class for defining factors. A factor is a function that is over
    an ORDERED sequence of variables called its scope. It maps every
    assignment of values to these variables to a number. In a Bayes
    Net every CPT is represented as a factor. Pr(A|B,C) for example
    will be represented by a factor over the variables (A,B,C). If we
    assign A = a, B = b, and C = c, then the factor will map this
    assignment, A=a, B=b, C=c, to a number that is equal to Pr(A=a|
    B=b, C=c). During variable elimination new factors will be
    generated. However, the factors computed during variable
    elimination do not necessarily correspond to conditional
    probabilities. Nevertheless, they still map assignments of values
    to the variables in their scope to numbers.

    Note that if the factor's scope is empty it is a constraint factor
    that stores only one value. add_values would be passed something
    like [[0.25]] to set the factor's single value. The get_value
    functions will still work.  E.g., get_value([]) will return the
    factor's single value. Constaint factors migth be created when a
    factor is restricted.'''

    def __init__(self, name, scope):
        '''create a Factor object, specify the Factor name (a string)

    def get_scope(self):

           the factor object'''
        return list(self.scope)

    def add_values(self, values):
        '''This routine can be used to initialize the factor. We pass
        it a list of lists. Each sublist is a ORDERED sequence of
        values, one for each variable in self.scope followed by a
        number that is the factor's value when its variables are
        assigned these values. For example, if self.scope = [A, B, C],
        and A.domain() = [1,2,3], B.domain() = ['a', 'b'], and
        C.domain() = ['heavy', 'light'], then we could pass add_values the

    def add_value_at_current_assignment(self, number): 

        '''This function allows adding values to the factor in a way
        that will often be more convenient. We pass it only a single
        number. It then looks at the assigned values of the variables
        in its scope and initializes the factor to have value equal to
        number on the current assignment of its variables. Hence, to
        use this function one first must set the current values of the
        variables in its scope.

        For example, if self.scope = [A, B, C],
        and A.domain() = [1,2,3], B.domain() = ['a', 'b'], and
        C.domain() = ['heavy', 'light'], and we first set an assignment for A, B
        and C:
        A.set_assignment(1)
        B.set_assignment('a')
        C.set_assignment('heavy')
        then we call 
        add_value_at_current_assignment(0.33)
         with the value 0.33, we would have initialized this factor to have
        the value 0.33 on the assigments (A=1, B='1', C='heavy')
        This has the same effect as the call
        add_values([1, 'a', 'heavy', 0.33])

        One advantage of the current_assignment interface to factor values is that
        we don't have to worry about the order of the variables in the factor's
        scope. add_values on the other hand has to be given tuples of values where 
        the values must be given in the same order as the variables in the factor's 
        scope. 

        See recursive_print_values called by print_table to see an example of 
        where the current_assignment interface to the factor values comes in handy.

   variables. For example if QueryVar = A with Dom[A] = ['a', 'b',
   'c'], EvidenceVars = [B, C], and we have previously called
   B.set_evidence(1) and C.set_evidence('c'), then VE would return a
   list of three numbers. E.g. [0.5, 0.24, 0.26]. These numbers would
   mean that Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.5 Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.24
   Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.26
