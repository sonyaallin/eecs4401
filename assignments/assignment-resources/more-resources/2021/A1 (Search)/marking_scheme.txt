Hello,

Assignment 1 for CSC384 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence has been
marked.

The assignment was evaluated automatically through a series of tests. These tests,
and the marking criteria used, are as follows:

(1) Test of the heuristic function in the context of best first search: 5 seconds (based on # solved; 25% max)
— >= 10% awarded based on # solved relative to Manhattan distance
— >= 20% awarded based on # solved relative to “better” benchmark 

(2) Test of anytime best first search: 8 seconds (based on # solved and length; 25% max)
— >= 15% awarded based on # solved relative to “better” benchmark 
- points deducted if any anytime best first search solution is longer than a best first search solution

(3) Test of the weighted a star function: 8 second (based on # solved and length; %25 max)
— >= 15% awarded based on # solved relative to “better” benchmark 
- points deducted if any weighted a star solution is longer than a best first search solution

(4) Test of f-value computation (based on 10 test cases similar to test code provided to students; 10% max)

(5) Test of manhattan distance heuristic (based on test cases similar to test code provided to students; 10% max)

(6) Read of tips.txt (5 sensible tips for heuristics in given domain; 5% max)
